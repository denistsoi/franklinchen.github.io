{I had played my opponent in three tournament games before, winning each game, so I started the game pretty confident.} 1.Nf3
c5 2.c4 Nc6 3.Nc3 g6 4.e3 {First time in my life I've ever played this opening!}
Bg7 5.d4 cxd4 6.exd4 d6 7.h3 Nf6 8.d5 Nb8 9.Be3 O-O 10.Be2 Nbd7
{Black has misplayed the opening and White has a significant advantage in space and development.}
{%08DA} 11.Rc1 {!?} {Trying to get b4 in quickly. But the hurry was not necessary.}
Nc5 12.b4 Nfe4 13.Nxe4 Nxe4 14.Bd4 {?} Bd7 {?} ( 14...Bh6 {This would have equalized.}
) 15.Bxg7 Kxg7 16.Qd4+ Nf6 {White has allowed pieces to be exchanged, but still has an advantage.}
{%08DA} 17.O-O b6 {Trying to stop c5.} 18.Nd2 {%08DA} Kg8 19.Rc3
{Aiming to perhaps swing over to e3.} {%08DA} a5 20.a3 {?!} {Giving Black the a file eventually causes White headaches.}
axb4 21.axb4 Ra4 22.Rb1 Bf5 23.Rbb3 {?!} {Trying to avoid an exchange with Bd3, but risky because of the unprotected back rank.}
{%08DA} Qb8 24.Re3 Qa7 25.g4 Ra1+ {?} {Tempting, but actually good for White, if White plays properly.}
26.Kg2 Bc2 27.Rb2 Bd1 {%08DA} 28.Nb3 {?!} {Oops, giving up a good Knight for a bad Bishop.}
( 28.Nf3 Bxe2 29.Rbxe2 {White has a great position.} {%08DA} )

{%08DA} Qb4 34.Qc2 Rca7 35.g5 Ne8 {%08DA} 36.Bg4 {A critical position. White is planning to finally get a King side attack going.}
{%08DA} Qc5 {??} {This probably already loses.} ( 36...f5 {White has nothing after this defense. In fact, Black has a slight advantage.}
{%08DA} ) 37.Qe4 {
Finally, at this point in the game, after four hours of play, I knew I probably
had a forced win. Black's King side is undefended.} {%08DA} Qb4
{Black hastens to trade Queens.} 38.h5 {With lots of threats, including even h6.}
{%08DA} Qb1 {?} {Natural, but loses quickly.} {%08DA} 39.Qxb1

f5 42.Bf3 Rc1 43.Ra6 {Black loses the b6 Pawn and the game.}
{%08DA} ) 41.Ra8 Kf8 {%08DA} 42.hxg6 {Black loses material. I saw this combination after Black's Qc5 six moves earlier.}
{%08DA} fxg6 ( 42...hxg6 43.Rh3 {Black loses the Knight on e8.}
{%08DA} ) 43.Rf3+ {It's actually a mate in 5.} {%08DA}
{This was a very long game, lasting well over four hours.  I got a huge
advantage out of the opening, but then squandered it in various ways, allowing
equalizing counterplay. But my opponent went astray at a critical point,
allowing me enough time to finally get my King side attack going.} 1-0
