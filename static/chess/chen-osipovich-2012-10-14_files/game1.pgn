{I had played my opponent only once before, six years ago. In that game, I was
Black. I remembered him playing very aggressively but unsoundly. So I entered
this game with the idea of containing his aggression and playing solidly.} 1.Nf3
b5 {Wow. I've never faced this before in my life. Not that I'm worried by this unsound flank opening.}
2.e4 a6 3.d4 {
So now we've transposed into Michael Basman's infamous "St. George" opening
that Tony Miles once used to beat Anatoly Karpov (who after the game called it
the "Incorrect Opening"). Karpov is right: the opening is "incorrect". But it
is not without point. Nevertheless, after playing this opening a couple of
times in my chess comeback in 2005 and losing badly to a weaker player, I never played it again.}
{%08DA} e6 4.Bd3 c5 {%08DA} 5.c3 {Most principled, holding the big center.}
{%08DA} c4 {?!} {
Closing the position. The problem is that it will take some time for Black to
create a Queen side attack while White starts a King side attack.}
6.Bc2 d5 {Now the position looks like a funny French.} {%08DA}
7.e5 {?!} {Deciding to go for an Advanced Variation of the French. White did not have to be so committal, however.}
( 7.O-O {Keeping the tension while continuing to develop normally was a good alternative.}
{%08DA} ) ( 7.exd5 {!} {
Opening up the position to take advantage of better development was strongest.
Black's overextended Pawns on the Queen side are a perpetual weakness.}
exd5 8.O-O {%08DA} ) f5 {!?} {Logical, trying to block up the position and create a draw.}
{%09DB} {%08DA} 8.exf6 {!?} {Committal, but I did not feel like dealing with the blocked position that would otherwise have ensued.}
Nxf6 {A critical position. White is clearly better, but not by any means winning. The
e5 square is clearly the key to the position, as it is in many variations of the French Defense.}
{%08DA} 9.O-O {?!} {The beginning of my playing natural but imprecise moves.}
( 9.Bf4 {Clearly the best move, immediately claiming the e5 outpost forever for White.}
{%08DA} Bd6 10.Ne5 O-O 11.Nd2 Qc7 12.O-O Nc6 13.Ndf3 {This is the kind of position that I should have aimed for immediately.}
{%08DA} ) Bd6 {Oops, now Bf4 is not possible.} {%08DA} 10.Bg5
{?} {Still playing natural but inaccurate moves. I thought, OK, I may want to
threaten h7 at some point, and also the Bishop can come around to h4 and g3.}
( 10.Qe2 {Best, to support Ne5.} {%08DA} ) O-O {?} {Natural, but actually justifies White's play.}
{%08DA} 11.Nbd2 {?} {A natural development move that loses White all advantage and concedes equality!}
( 11.Ne5 {By occupying e5 at this moment, White would have had a beautiful game.}
{%08DA} Nbd7 12.f4 {Black is in serious, serious trouble.} {%08DA} )
Qc7 {At this point, I realized that I no longer had any advantage; the position is
now equal. I was pretty upset about missing my opportunities to play Ne5. Black
has all kinds of threats now against White's King side.} {%08DA}
12.Qe2 Nc6 13.Rae1 {White wants to put the Knight on e5.} {%08DA}
h6 14.Bh4 {%08DA} Bd7 {?} {A natural developing move, but bad.}
( 14...Nh5 {!} {Black needed to strike immediately at White to maintain equality.}
{%08DA} 15.Bg3 Nf4 {Black is completely OK.} {%08DA} ) 15.Bg3
{?} ( 15.Ne5 {Basically a won position for White.} {%08DA} Be8
{??} ( 15...Rae8 16.f4 {%08DA} ) 16.Bxf6 Rxf6 17.Ng4 {White wins the e6 Pawn or the Rook on f6.}
{%08DA} ) Rae8 {?} {
Another natural move that does nothing against the threat that has been in the
air for White since Black played f5 eight moves ago!}
( 15...Bxg3 16.hxg3 b4 17.Ne5 Nxe5 18.dxe5 Nh7 19.Nf3 {White may have a slight advantage, but I think Black can hold this simplified position.}
{%08DA} ) 16.Ne5 {
Finally!! The game is essentially over now. White has an overwhelming position,
and Black has no counterplay. White will simply invade Black's King side and win.}
{%08DA} Bxe5 {?} 17.dxe5 Nh7 {Black is clearly lost. The question is, how should White proceed?}
{%08DA} 18.Nf3 {Natural, and not bad, but not best.}
( 18.Qg4 {Activating the Queen was best.} Ne7 19.Nf3 {%08DA} )
Qd8 {??} {Immediately losing material: an Exchange.} {%08DA}
19.Bg6 {The Rook is trapped.} {%08DA} Re7 20.Bh4 Rf4 {
I was surprised my opponent did not resign, but then again, I should not have
been surprised, given my experience playing him in the past.}
{%08DA} 21.Bxe7 ( 21.Qe3 Qf8 22.Bxe7 Nxe7 23.Bc2 ) Nxe7 {Black is dead lost. How should White finish the game?}
{%08DA} 22.g3 {?} {I thought this Zwischenzug was clever, but actually it's terrible.}
( 22.Bb1 {Natural and good. I was going to play it, but then decided to be clever.}
{%08DA} ) Nxg6 {%03!} {Of course Black is happy to get counterplay by sacrificing another Exchange!}
23.gxf4 Nxf4 24.Qe3 {
I was pretty unhappy reaching this position, in which White is up two Exchanges
but Black has some real counterplay going on against White's King. White still has a won game, but has to play precisely.}
{%08DA} Qf8 ( 24...Ng5 25.Kh1 {%08DA} ) 25.Nd4 {?}
( 25.Kh1 {Most accurate.} {%08DA} ) Ng5 26.Kh1 Be8 {?} {There is not enough time for Black to make the Bishop work.}
( 26...Nd3 {Active Knights give White more trouble.} {%08DA}
27.Re2 ) 27.Rg1 {White has consolidated and now Black has no more chances.}
{%08DA} Nd3 28.Ref1 ( 28.h4 {Wins immediately, but I saw no need to be clever.}
{%08DA} ) Bg6 29.Nxe6 {I changed my mind and got clever.}
( 29.h4 {Easy win.} {%08DA} ) Be4+ {?} {%09DB} 30.Qxe4 {I thought this position was cute, with both Queens being threatened.}
( 30.f3 ) Qxf2 {%09DB} 31.Qxd5 {Black resigned.} {%08DA}
( 31.Qg6 {Was a faster checkmate, but who cares?} {%08DA} )
{The main lesson of this game is that natural developing moves are often bad
moves that ignore the forcing nature of the position. In particular, control
and occupation of the e5 square in this game was a matter of life and death,
and both sides repeatedly ignored opportunities to either occupy it or prevent
its effective occupation. Ironically, we also saw that sometimes a natural move
is best while the clever move allows counterplay (Black's second sacrifice of the Exchange).} 1-0
