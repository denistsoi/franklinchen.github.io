{This turned out to be one of the most fascinating games I have ever played.
Many of the interesting points lie in variations that were executed on the
board, but "could have been", with amazing computer-calculated lines.} 1.c3
{I completely expected Peter to play this. He is happy to play for a draw.}
f5 {I had planned before the game to play the Dutch against 1 c3, just as GM
Alexander Shabalov had done against Peter in a Pittsburgh Chess League game in
2007 http://www.uschess.org/assets/msa_joomla/XtblMain.php?200710142921.1-12533530^013^010

} {
The funny thing is that after the game, I told Peter that I remembered Shabalov
had played the Dutch against him in a simultaneous exhibition, but he corrected
me and said it was an actual tournament game. He was right, I had
misremembered. The important thing is that I did remember Shabalov playing the Leningrad Dutch against him.}
2.d4 d6 3.Nf3 g6 4.h4 {!?} {Very aggressive immediate attack, which I anticipated.}
{%08DA} Nf6 5.Bg5 Nbd7 6.Nbd2 {%08DA} h6 {!} {
The whole point of this move order, which I had decided on in my preparation,
is to kick White's Bishop back now, in order to be able to play e6 blocking the White diagonal from b3 to g8.}
{%08DA} ( 6...Bg7 {Was possible, but allows White to disrupt Black's castling plans.}
7.Qb3 {%08DA} ) 7.Qb3 {!?} {Wow. I have to confess that I did not realize White could play Qb3 anyway!}
( 7.Bf4 e6 {And Black has full equality, a very solid block of Pawns preventing White from invading.}
{%08DA} ) Bg7 {%09DB} ( 7...hxg5 {?} {Taking the Bishop does not lose, but results in a worse position for Black.}
8.Nxg5 {%08DA} d5 9.Ne6 Nc5 10.Nxc5 {Black is a Pawn down.} {%08DA} )
8.h5 {?!!} {
Another unexpected attacking move! Not fully sound, but definitely creative.
White is trying to blast Black to bits straight out of the opening!}
{%08DA} Nxh5 9.Nh4 {?!?} {Nice try aiming at g6, but I had already calculated in the previous move that objectively it does not work.}
{%08DA} Nf8 {The best defense, and it is good enough to force White back.}
( 9...hxg5 {?} {
I pointed out after the game that it was actually possible for Black to take
the Bishop and survive, but the resulting position is only equal.}
{%08DA} 10.Nxg6 {%08DA} Rh6 ( 10...Ndf6 {?} {I looked at giving up the exchange, but it is not totally safe.}
11.Nxh8 Bxh8 12.e4 {Black is not lost, but White clearly has the initiative.}
{%08DA} ) 11.Qg8+ Nf8 12.Nxf8 Rh8 13.Qxg7 Nxg7 14.Rxh8 Kf7 {A crazy looking position that is equal.}
{%08DA} ) 10.Nxg6 {White has no choice but to do more sacrificing.}
{%08DA} Nxg6 11.Rxh5 d5 {?} {I thought this was good, but the computer disagrees!}
{%08DA} ( 11...Kf8 {!} {The computer happily defends the g8 square with the King and claims a winning advantage.}
{%08DA} 12.Bh4 ( 12.Be3 f4 {Trapping the Bishop.} {%08DA} ) Nf4
{Winning the exchange.} {%08DA} 13.g4 Nxh5 14.gxh5 Qe8 15.d5
Qxh5 16.Bg3 {Black is an exchange and Pawn up. His King is not ideally placed but he can hold.}
{%08DA} ) 12.e4 {??} {It turns out this loses, so I should have thought more here than I did.}
( 12.Be3 {%08DA} c6 {Best, but White has an advantage.} {%08DA}
( 12...f4 {?} {Both of us missed that White does not actually lose the trapped Bishop in this position!!}
{%08DA} 13.Rxd5 Bd7 14.Qc2 {Oops, Black is in trouble now!} {%08DA} ) )
fxe4 {?} {Wins a Pawn, but White is actually about equal because of Black's unsafe King.}
( 12...hxg5 {
Of course. Both of us totally missed that the earlier Qg8 tactic no longer
applies because of the Pawn at d5 blocking the diagonal! Black is just up a piece for a Pawn.}
{%08DA} 13.Rxh8+ Bxh8 14.exd5 Qd6 {Black has an easily won game. White no longer has any attack, and Black only needs to consolidate.}
{%08DA} ) 13.Be3 ( 13.Bh4 {??} Nf4 {%08DA} ) c6 {
At this point, it was clear that White's attack has been blunted. Still, Black
does not have a real advantage despite being a Pawn up. Black still needs to find time to castle Queen side.}
{%08DA} 14.Be2 ( 14.f3 {Continuiing to open lines may have been best.}
{%08DA} Qd6 {%08DA} 15.O-O-O exf3 16.gxf3 {White is OK.} {%08DA} )
Qc7 {Threatening Nf4 and hurrying to be able to castle Queen side.}
{%08DA} 15.g3 Bd7 16.O-O-O O-O-O {Black doesn't really have an advantage in this position, despite being temporarily a Pawn up, because the h6 Pawn is so weak.}
{%08DA} 17.Nxe4 {??!!} {Part of a hallucination, but it actually could have worked!!}
{%08DA} dxe4 18.Qf7 {Seemingly forking the Knight on g6 and Bishop on g7 to regain the piece.}
{%08DA} Qd6 {White missed this move.} {%08DA} 19.Qxg7 {??} {The actual losing move.}
( 19.Ra5 {!!} {
Neither of us saw this saving move. It looks so bizarre, but the computer
immediately finds it. The point is that Black's Bishop and Knight on the King
side are so weak that eventually White can regain a piece after all, or
otherwise gets a Queen side attack. Completely bizarre.} {%08DA}
Rhg8 {The computer immediately finds a forced draw for White by repetition.}
{%08DA} ( 19...Rdg8 {??} 20.Qb3 {
White is actually winning after this. Check the computer if you don't believe.
White has threats involving taking the a7 Pawn, playing d5 to blast open the
position and bring the dark Bishop into play, or playing Bh5 to remove the defender of the f4 square.}
{%08DA} ) 20.Qb3 {
White has, as in a previously mentioned variation, deadly threats of d5, Rxa7,
Bh5, etc. Black can miraculously defend and force a draw.} {%08DA}
Be6 21.d5 cxd5 22.Rxa7 {%08DA} Qc6 23.Bb5 d4 {%08DA} 24.Qa4 Qc5
25.Qa5 {%08DA} Qxa7 {Black has to give up the Queen to avoid mate.}
{%08DA} 26.Qxa7 dxe3 27.Qa8+ Kc7 28.Rxd8 Rxd8 29.Qa5+ Kc8 30.Qa8+
Kc7 {%08DA} 31.Qa5+ Kc8 {A draw by repetition.} {%08DA} ) Rdg8
20.Qf7 Be6 {The White Queen is trapped!} {%08DA} 21.Bf4 {Just random desperation to continue the game.}
{%08DA} Bxf7 {?!} {
Wins, but objectively there was a stronger win. But I was happy to just take a
piece advantage. The rest of the game is just a matter of technique.}
( 21...Qd7 {Forces the win of a Queen for a Rook.} 22.Qxg8+ Rxg8
23.Bxh6 Bxa2 {White is completely lost.} {%08DA} ) 22.Bxd6 exd6
23.Rdh1 Bxa2 24.Rxh6 {Black is a solid Knight up.} {%08DA} Bf7
25.Kd2 Rxh6 26.Rxh6 {%08DA} Rg7 {Locking White's Rook out of h7.}
27.b4 Kc7 28.Rh1 Ne7 {Redeploying the extra Knight.} {%08DA}
29.c4 d5 {Deciding to fix the Pawn structure before invading with the Knight.}
30.c5 a6 31.g4 Be6 {The end is near.} {%08DA} 32.Rh4 Ng6 33.Rh1
Nf4 {White is going to lose another Pawn.} {%08DA} 34.Rh6 Nxe2
35.Rxe6 Nxd4 36.Rh6 Rxg4 {White resigned, being a piece and two Pawns down for nothing.}
