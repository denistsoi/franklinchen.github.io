{I went into this game with a bad record against my opponent: one draw as White
(after a totally won position out of the opening), and one loss as White (a
deserved loss from poor opening play). This was my first game as Black against him.} 1.d4
d5 2.Nc3 {Not unexpected. I'd seen him play it before, and his son had played it against me two years ago.}
Nf6 3.Bg5 Nbd7 4.Nf3 h6 5.Bh4 e6 6.e4 {!?} {The Veresov Gambit, played by Veresov himself.}
{%08DA} g5 {Black snatches the Pawn, of course.} {%08DA} 7.Bg3
Nxe4 8.Nxe4 dxe4 9.Nd2 f5 {!} {%08DA} 10.Bc4 ( 10.Qh5+ Ke7 {%08DA}
11.f4 Nf6 12.Qe2 Qxd4 {%08DA} 13.Nc4 {??} {Loses, but I did not play the winning continuation in Michael Booth - Franklin Chen, 2010-09-04.}
{%08DA} ( 13.O-O-O Qa4 {Black has a clear advantage, holding the extra Pawn.}
{%08DA} ) ) Nf6 11.Be5 {A very important position. White clearly has compensation for the Pawn.}

e3 {!?} {Taking up the challenge of advancing the Pawn.} {%08DA}
13.Nb3 Kf7 {?!} {Deciding to bail out and return the Pawn.}
( 13...f4 {The logical followup.} {%08DA} 14.Qd3 Qe7 15.O-O-O

16.Qxe3 {White has some advantage.} {%08DA} ) Kxg7 16.O-O-O {%08DA}
Re8 {Black is OK here, but White has clear compensation. Black's remaining Bishop is quite poor.}
{%08DA} 17.Kb1 {?} {Too slow.} {%08DA} c6 {Planning to break free on the Queen side somehow with b5.}
( 17...a5 {!} {Even more active, but I was mixing up some move orders.}
{%08DA} ) 18.g3 {%09DB} b5 {?} {Objectively bad, because of the gaping hole on c5 as well as the locked-in Bishop. I should have stuck to the original plan.}
( 18...a5 {Black is OK, because of the plan of chasing White's Knight back before playing b5.}
{%08DA} ) 19.Bxd5 exd5 {Black is in some trouble now. Can White break through?}
{%08DA} 20.h4 a5 {?!} {
Kind of flailing. There is a very slow plan of maybe getting the Bishop to a6
and the Rook to a7 to lift, but it is a slow plan.} {%08DA} 21.hxg5
Qxg5 22.f4 Qe7 {%08DA} 23.Rh2 Qe4 {?!} {Deciding to try to bail out into an endgame rather than continue the Rook lift idea.}
{%08DA} 24.Nc5 {?} {Giving up all winning chances really.}
( 24.Qe2 {White should have kept the Queens on the board.} {%08DA} )
Qxd3 25.Nxd3 b4 {Black is fully OK now, being able to activate the Bishop.}
{%08DA} 26.Rdh1 Re6 27.Ne5 Ba6 {%08DA} 28.Kc1 Rc8 {Trying to create counterplay on the c file. But the position is really a draw by now.}
{%08DA} 29.Rh5 {?} {The beginning of a bad plan leading nowhere.}
c5 {!} {Sacrificing the f5 Pawn in order to open up lines elsewhere.}
{%08DA} 30.dxc5 Rxc5 {%08DA} 31.Rxf5 {?} {Too greedy. Now the Rook is out of play and the King is undefended.}
( 31.Nf3 {Survives.} Bd3 32.Nd4 Re4 {Black is better but White might survive.}
{%08DA} ) d4 {?!} {Slow.} {%09DB} ( 31...Re7 {Protecting e7 first was strong.}
{%08DA} ) 32.Kd1 {??} {Loses immediately!} ( 32.g4 {?} Rc7 {d3 will be deadly.}

{Still dangerous for White but simplified, at least.} {%08DA} )
e2+ {?!??} {Wrong move order! But the right move order was hard to find.}
( 32...Re7 {
This wins, with the same idea as in the game, but in the right move order. The
obvious plan is to play e2 and also swing the Rook over Rec7 and hit c2 and win.}
{%08DA} 33.Ng6 {Attempt at simplifying tactic.} Rxf5 34.Nxe7
Rf7 {White's Knight is trapped!} {%08DA} 35.Nd5 Bb7 {%08DA} 36.Rh5
Rd7 {%08DA} 37.Nb6 Bf3+ {Wins White's Rook. No, I did not see this long variation during the game! The computer found it.}
{%08DA} ) 33.Kd2 Re7 {
The critical position of the game. White can actually hold, but he spent twenty
minutes thinking and failed to come up with the saving move.}
{%08DA} 34.Rfh5 {??} {
I'm not sure why White chose to play an obviously losing move. It must have
been disheartening, however, not to have found the saving tactic.}
( 34.Ng6 {Discovery tactic! I missed this too!} {%08DA} Rxf5
35.Nxe7 Rf7 {Trying to trap the Knight.} {%08DA} 36.Nd5 Bb7 37.Rh5
Rd7 38.Nb6 {White's Knight escapes.} {%08DA} ) Rec7 {The game is completely over.}
{%08DA} 35.Rxh6 {Now there is a quick win for Black.} Rxc2+ 36.Ke1
Rc1+ 37.Kf2 Rf1+ {White resigned.} {%08DA} {A pretty wild game, in which neither side played perfectly, but the one who made the final blunders lost.} 0-1
