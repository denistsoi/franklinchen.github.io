{Slow.} 7.Bc4 {%08DA} Na5 {??} {
I was stunned for several seconds as I saw this move, because this allows me a
winning shot that I played in an almost identical position in a game I played 27 years ago that I blogged about not long ago!}
{%08DA} 8.Bxf7+ {!} {
It took me a couple of seconds to double-check that this move works as
expected. Black resigned several seconds after I played this move.}
{%08DA} Z0 ( 8...Kxf7 9.Ne6 {!} {The key followup, of course.}
Bxc3+ ( 9...Qe8 10.Nc7 Qf8 ( 10...Qd8 11.Qd5+ e6 12.Nxe6 {!}
{Double jeopardy on e6! Black is dead.} {%08DA} ) 11.Qf3+ {Followed by picking off Black's Rook on a8 and a continued attack.}
{%08DA} ) 10.bxc3 Qe8 ( 10...Kxe6 {The critical line, of course, taking both of White's sacrificial pieces one after another.}
{%08DA} 11.Qd5+ Kf6 12.Bd4+ e5 13.Qxe5+ Kf7 14.Qxh8 {Black has lost material and will lose more.}
{%08DA} ) 11.Nc7 {Similar to the line with the exchange on c3: Black is just losing material.}
{%08DA} ) 1-0
