{This was my first tournament game against Kurt, whom I had played a few blitz
games with several years ago. So I had no real idea what opening he was going
to play. I just knew that he played aggressively.} 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3
Nc6 3.Bb5 d6 {An aggressive if risky response. This was the first time I played this continuation against the Rossolimo.}
{%08DA} 4.Bxc6+ bxc6 5.O-O e5 {The point of Black's play is to try to get a lock on the center.}
{%08DA} 6.c3 Bg4 {!?} {
An aggressive attempt to make d4 less pleasant for White. I was inspired to
play this as a result of last week's game in which another opponent was Black and pinned my Knight on f3.}
{%08DA} 7.h3 Bh5 8.Re1 Nf6 9.d4 cxd4 10.cxd4 Nd7 {
The whole point of Black's play, which was to develop the Bishop before doing
the Knight maneuver to hold e5. Black cannot at all afford to allow White to play e5.}
{%08DA} 11.Nbd2 Be7 {
Black has almost finished development and is ready to castle. We're out of the
opening. This is the position I anticipated and was aiming for when playing
Bg4. White is still slightly better, but I hoped to defend and then make use of the two Bishops.}
{%08DA} 12.Qa4 {?} {Does not accomplish much.} ( 12.Nc4 {
I believe White maintains an advantage by completing his own Queen side
development and saddling Black with a weak Pawn on c6 and} O-O
13.g4 Bg6 14.dxe5 dxe5 15.Qc2 {%08DA} ) Qc7 {Black has had time to catch up in development and now has a solid, clearly equal position.}
{%08DA} 13.Re3 {?!} {With possible Rook lift ideas. But note that White's remaining Bishop is dangerously undeveloped.}
O-O 14.g4 {?} {Very committal, and clearly weakening. Black is better now.}
{%08DA} Bg6 15.Nf1 {?} {White is the one falling behind in development now, ironically. Black has a clear advantage.}
{%08DA} Bf6 {?!} {Not the most accurate move order to attack White's center, but OK, forcing White on the defensive.}
( 15...Rfe8 {White is in virtual Zugzwang, pieces uncoordinated. This move order could transpose into the game.}
{%08DA} ) 16.dxe5 Nxe5 17.Ng3 {?} {White's Queen side is just not being developed.}
( 17.Nxe5 Bxe5 18.Re2 {Freeing the remaining Bishop was best here.}
{%08DA} ) d5 {Taking over the center and opening the position for the two Bishops. White has some difficulties.}
( 17...Rab8 {
Black has a strong positional bind. White has little to do, while Black can
continue improving his position before breaking in the center at will.}
{%08DA} ) 18.Nxe5 {?} {%09DB} Bxe5 {%08DA} 19.Nf5 {An important position.}
{%08DA} Rfe8 {?} {
It turns out this is poor because of tactics against the Rook on e8. In fact,
right after I played this move, I saw the refutation, but kept a poker face.}
( 19...Bxf5 {
The best move, which I had considered, and which my opponent later correctly
said I failed to act on, but I had hoped to get more without simplification.}
{%08DA} 20.gxf5 ( 20.exf5 c5 {Black has a great position.} {%08DA} )
d4 21.Re1 Rfb8 {White is struggling here also.} {%08DA} ) 20.Kg2
{?} {%09DB} ( 20.exd5 {Equalizes on the spot.} {%08DA} Bxf5
( 20...cxd5 {??} 21.f4 {Oops, Black's Bishop is pinned!} {%08DA} )
21.gxf5 Qd7 22.dxc6 Qxf5 {It is White who is a Pawn up, although the position is a draw.}
{%08DA} ) Re6 {!?} {Trying to maintain tension, and setting a little trap, now having seen the f4 idea.}
( 20...Bxf5 21.exf5 Qd7 {Black has a clear advantage but simplification means the chance of a draw is very likely.}
{%08DA} ) 21.exd5 cxd5 {%08DA} 22.f4 {??} {Falling into the trap I had set!}
{%08DA} Bf6 {
After this calm retreat, Black has a won position. Unfortunately, I became very
anxious at this point, and started taking a lot of time thinking of how to win immediately.}
( 22...Bxf4 {??} 23.Rxe6 fxe6 24.Bxf4 {Bad for Black.} {%08DA} )
23.Bd2 {Deciding to give up the b Pawn in an attempt at a draw. Psychologically, this
worked, because as Black I looked for a knockout win and ended up paralyzed by too many ideas.}
{%09DB} {%08DA} Qb6 {??!} {
A very strange decision, after 23 minutes of thought that went nowhere. I
decided to go for an endgame. Unfortunately, a very long calculation I did turned out to be incorrect!!}
( 23...Bxf5 24.gxf5 Rxe3 25.Bxe3 d4 {Black wins.} {%08DA} 26.Bd2
Qb7+ {White will lose a Pawn, and his King is completely exposed. The game is over.}
{%08DA} ) ( 23...Bxb2 {Snatching the Pawn was obvious and fine, but I got all weird.}
{%08DA} 24.Rae1 Bxf5 25.gxf5 Rxe3 26.Bxe3 {I saw this position, but was not sure how to win in the face of all the simplification.}
{%08DA} ) 24.Qb3 Rae8 {?} {Still believing in that endgame idea.}
( 24...Qd8 {Keeping the tension still retained a winning game.}
{%08DA} ) 25.Rae1 {?} {%09DB} ( 25.Qxb6 {This would have been a quick equalizer.}
{%08DA} axb6 26.Rae1 {Black has nothing.} {%08DA} ) Qxb3 {?}
{Consistent. I had decided to bail out into an endgame.}
( 25...Qd8 {There was still an opportunity to maintain some advantage by avoiding the Queen trade.}
{%08DA} ) 26.axb3 {?} ( 26.Rxb3 {Holds, tactically.} {%08DA} )
Bxf5 27.gxf5 Rxe3 28.Rxe3 {A critical position, and the one I actually expected and aimed for with the whole Qb6 idea! Black has a clear advantage.}
{%08DA} Rc8 {?} {At the last moment, I decided to keep the Rooks on the board.}
( 28...Rxe3 29.Bxe3 a6 {Black will win a Pawn. Whether it is enough to win is another story.}
{%08DA} ) 29.Rd3 d4 {The beginning of a faulty idea. The game is already drawn, but I did not realize it.}
{%08DA} 30.Kf3 Rc2 {The game is not only drawn, but Black faces some dangers because of White's active King.}
{%08DA} 31.Ke4 {?!} ( 31.Bb4 {Easy equalizer, aiming to win the d4 Pawn immediately.}
{%08DA} ) Rxb2 32.Kd5 ( 32.Bb4 ) h5 33.Bb4 {%08DA} Rc2 {?!} {Mistakenly looking for a quick win.}
( 33...Rf2 {%08DA} 34.Bd6 ) 34.Bc5 Rc3 35.Rxc3 dxc3 36.Kc4 {%08DA}
c2 {I honestly hallucinated that I had a win here. I traded Rooks because of that.
I grabbed the Black Queen from my opponent's side of the table and planned to Queen!!}
{%08DA} 37.Ba3 {
Oops. Somehow I missed this. I was starting to get in time pressure, but not so
much as to justify the carelessness in calculation that led up to this position.}
{%08DA} Be7 38.Bc1 {It's a draw now.} {%08DA} g6 {
An important position. By playing g6, I was basically admitting that the game
was a draw, that my King could not move around to escape its prison and win the
f5 Pawn. I expected the game to be agreed to a draw within ten moves because of a "forced" continuation.}
39.Kd3 {!!?} {
Psychologically brilliant. The game is drawn anyway, so why not try to create
pointless complications for the side who is short on time but ambitious?}
{%09DB} ( 39.fxg6 fxg6 40.Kd3 Kf7 41.Kxc2 Kf6 42.Kd3 Kf5 43.Ke3
g5 44.Kf3 g4+ 45.hxg4+ hxg4+ 46.Kg3 {This is the position I was aiming for when I played g6, guaranteeing a draw.}
) gxf5 {??!} {
Objectively should not lose, but gives White chances. I suddenly threw away my
calculated draw and gambled that White was making a mistake.}
{%09DB} ( 39...Kg7 {The safe thing to play under time pressure, and obviously transposing by force to my earlier calculated draw.}
{%08DA} 40.Kxc2 gxf5 {Again, taking is perfectly fine and best, but not necessary.}
{%08DA} ( 40...Kf6 {Safest.} 41.fxg6 fxg6 42.Kd3 Kf5 43.Ke3 g5
44.Kf3 g4+ 45.hxg4+ hxg4+ 46.Kg3 {
The clear draw, which I had seen earlier in a transposition, but I which I
rejected because I was suddenly hoping to win by lopping off a free Pawn from White.}
{%08DA} ) ) 40.Kxc2 {
It's a dead draw. Black should not be able to make progress despite the extra
Pawn. White cannot make progress either, as long as Black protects his weak King side Pawns.}
{%08DA} {%09DB} Bc5 {?} {Getting careless in a time scramble.}
( 40...Kg7 41.Kd3 Kf6 42.Kc4 Ke6 43.Be3 a6 {It's a draw.} {%08DA} )
41.Kd3 Kf8 42.Kc4 Bb6 {?} {Passive. The game is still a draw, but there is no reason to allow White to invade further.}
( 42...Bd6 43.Kd5 Ke7 {Preventing White from invading on e5 maintains the draw.}
{%08DA} ) 43.Kd5 {%09DB} Ke7 ( 43...Bc7 {Keeping White from e5 holds the draw.}
{%08DA} 44.Kc6 Bb6 45.Ba3+ Ke8 ) 44.Ke5 Kd7 {
At this point, I stopped keeping score because I had less than 5 minutes left
on the clock. And I knew I was getting into trouble.}
( 44...Bf2 45.Kxf5 Bg3 {Losing the Pawn back still holds the draw.}
{%08DA} ) 45.Kxf5 {%08DA} Kc6 {??} {Just aimless blitzing now. The game is over.}
{%08DA} ( 45...Bd8 {Effortlessly holds the draw, by preventing White from making progress on the King side.}
{%08DA} ) 46.Kf6 Kd5 47.Kxf7 Ke4 48.Kg6 h4 49.f5 Bd4 50.Bg5 Kd3
51.Be7 Kc2 52.b4 Kb3 53.f6 {All my moves after I stopped keeping score were a total farce. I should have just taken a moment to think.}
{%08DA} {One of the most painful losses in my life. Four hours of play, including missing a win, and then blowing a drawn endgame.} 1-0
