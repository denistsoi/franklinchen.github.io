1.Nf3 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 c5 {I did not expect this reply.}
( 4...d6 {I'd expected a transposition to the King's Indian.}
5.d4 {%08DA} ) 5.d4 cxd4 6.Nxd4 d6 7.Be2 Nc6 {Now we have a Sicilian, Maroczy Bind. This is a slow, positional approach against the Accelerated Dragon Sicilian.}
{%08DA} 8.Be3 Nxd4 9.Bxd4 O-O 10.O-O Be6 {
I went into a deep think here. After the game, my opponent asked why, given
that this is a standard opening position. I responded that I wanted to play the
most aggressive plan here, not the most common one, and I needed to mentally switch gears.}
{%08DA} 11.f4 {
Most aggressive and completely different from the usual plan that involves f3.
This is risky because of the opening of White's dark diagonal to the King as
well as not overprotecting e4 and not protecting g4.}
( 11.Qd2 {The most common plan by White, which I rejected as being less interesting.}
{%08DA} ) Qc8 {?!} {Stopping f5 and threatening the c4 Pawn. But the Queen is misplaced.}
{%09DB} ( 11...Rc8 {Most common.} ) 12.Nd5 {!?} {I wanted to get the two Bishops by force.}
Bxd5 13.exd5 {
At this point, I felt happy with my position, having more space and the two
Bishops, and the classic Bind Pawn structure in which White has more space, a
bind on the Queen side, and pressure on Black's half-open e file as well as King side attacking opportunities.}
{%08DA} b5 {!?} {Either a miscalculation or a a deliberate Pawn sacrifice to try to free Black's position.}
( 13...a5 {
I think this thematic plan is Black's only hope of sound counterplay. Black
controls b4 and plans to bring the Knight to d7 and then to c5 as an outpost, and possibly play a4 as needed.}
{%08DA} ) 14.cxb5 {%09DB} Qb7 {Forced since the White Pawn is actually poisoned.}
( 14...Nxd5 {??} {White's d5 Pawn is poisoned.} 15.Bxg7 {%08DA} )
15.Bc4 {Good enough to keep b5 and d5 protected.} ( 15.a4 {Another method of keeping everything protected. The d5 Pawn is still poisoned.}
) Rfc8 16.Qd3 {And White keeps the extra Pawn.} ( 16.b3 {?} {Allows Black to regain the Pawn.}
Nxd5 17.Bxg7 Ne3 18.Qe2 Qb6 {%08DA} ) Nxd5 {?} {
Unfortunately, the Pawn really is still poisoned. Black should have just
acknowledged that the Pawn sacrifice was a true sacrifice that did not work out.}
17.Bxg7 Nb6 18.Bxf7+ {Black is clearly lost now, not only a Pawn down but with his King exposed. It doesn't matter which Bishop he takes!}
{%08DA} Kxg7 ( 18...Kxf7 {Taking the other Bishop is also terrible.}
19.Bd4 {Black is about to lose already, with the King side torn apart.}
{%08DA} ) 19.Be6 Rf8 20.Qd4+ {!} {A forcing continuation putting Black's pieces in awkward squares.}
Rf6 21.g4 {Threatening to win the Rook with g5.} {%08DA} Kf8
{An important position. Black is clearly about to lose, but how should White
finish off the game? One thing to note, from a practical standpoint, is that
the game has already lasted two and a half hours. A bit of fatigue and impatience have set in.}
{%08DA} 22.f5 {?!} {Not the best plan to win.} ( 22.Rae1 {
This simple move would have won immediately, by protecting e6 and threatening
g5. After all the hard work of playing very precisely to reach this position, I suddenly had an energy drop.}
) g5 {%09DB} 23.h4 {!} {White is still winning, with the plan of prying open the King side and either winning the g5 Pawn or going down the h file.}
h6 {At this point, I started getting hallucinating about Black's Rook getting to
h6, but in reality, everything was fine. My energy was getting low. I started eating some trail mix I brought.}
{%08DA} 24.a4 {I got carried away with the idea of lifting the Queen Rook.}
( 24.hxg5 {But a simple Rook lift with the other Rook wins easily!}
hxg5 25.Rf2 Rh6 26.Rh2 ) Rb8 25.hxg5 hxg5 26.Ra3 {I thought this was cute.}
( 26.Rf2 {Still best, getting to h2 quickly.} ) Rh6 {%09DB} 27.Raf3
{?} {Wrong Rook! I suddenly got fixated with the idea of winning the g5 Pawn using my Queen.}
( 27.Rff3 {Moving the right Rook was strong and wins easily, getting over to h3.}
{%08DA} ) Nd7 28.Bxd7 Qxd7 29.Qe3 {White is still winning, but material has been reduced.}
{%08DA} Kf7 30.Qxg5 {?} {
I thought I saw an easy win and got very careless. I was down to 20 minutes on
the clock and my opponent was down to 34. I still had time to collect myself but was impatient.}
( 30.Rh3 {There was still time to win on the h file.} {%08DA} )
Rbh8 31.f6 {The move I was fixated on getting in.} Rh1+ {?}
( 31...Ke8 {!} 32.fxe7 Qxe7 33.Qxe7+ Kxe7 {Black might actually be able to hold this endgame.}
{%08DA} ) 32.Kf2 R8h2+ 33.Ke1 {??!} {Played without any thought, assuming that the game was over for Black!!}
( 33.Ke3 {!} {The King march was correct.} Qe6+ 34.Kd4 {White wins!}
{%08DA} ) Qe6+ {
Oops!!! I totally missed that because I played f6, suddenly Black's Queen could
come to e6. Very, very careless. Now I had to make sure that I wasn't losing.}
{%08DA} 34.Re3 Rxf1+ 35.Kxf1 {
A critical position. Black can either force an endgame that is not so good for
him, or try for perpetual check somehow. I was down to 14 minutes, but Black still had 27 minutes.}
{%08DA} Qc4+ {??} {The wrong decision, played after 15 minutes of thought. Black now loses by force.}
( 35...Qxf6+ 36.Qxf6+ Kxf6 {
I had thought this ending was possibly winnable for White, but looking more
closely, it seems that Black's King is too active and White's King is out of play.}
{%08DA} 37.Rb3 {White surely has to try to immediately push the a and b Pawns to Queen.}
{%08DA} ( 37.g5+ {Going for the a Pawn and e Pawn does not suffice, because Black's King is sufficiently active.}
{%08DA} Kxg5 38.Rxe7 Rxb2 39.Rxa7 Kf4 {White cannot make sufficient progress.}
{%08DA} 40.Ra6 Kf3 41.Ke1 Ke3 42.Rxd6 Rb1+ 43.Rd1 Rb4 44.Ra1
Kd4 {%08DA} ) Rh1+ {Black must stop White's a Pawn immediately.}
{%08DA} 38.Kf2 ( 38.Kg2 Ra1 39.Ra3 Rb1 40.Ra2 Rc1 41.a5 Rc4 42.Kf3
Rb4 43.b6 a6 {%08DA} ) Ra1 39.Ra3 Rh1 40.a5 Rh2+ 41.Ke3 Rxb2
42.b6 a6 43.Rc3 {I think White cannot actually win, because of Black's Pawns that can advance.}
{%08DA} e5 44.Rc8 Rb3+ 45.Kd2 e4 46.Kc2 Rb4 47.Ra8 e3 48.Rxa6

{This is an insane computer-generated variation in which I assume White cannot force a win.}
{%08DA} ) 36.Kg1 exf6 {A critical position. White's Queen is threatened. Does White have to move the Queen and give Black valuable time?}
{%08DA} 37.Rf3 {!} {
The key move that wins. White will win the Black Rook or checkmate through
taking on f6. I was fortunate to have seen this earlier.}
( 37.Qf5 {?} {Now it's a draw.} Rh4 {No way for White to make progress now.}
{%08DA} ) Rg2+ {Aiming simply to reach a King and Pawn ending, which unfortunately is lost.}
{%09DB} ( 37...Rc2 {Moving the Rook away allows White to break through on f6.}

Qe2+ 39.Rf2 Qxf2+ 40.Kxf2 fxg5 {Unfortunately, this King and Pawn ending is trivially lost for Black.}
{%08DA} 41.a5 Ke7 {%08DA} 42.b6 axb6 43.a6 {And White will have a new Queen soon.}
{%08DA} {A very intense game that took four hours to complete!
 
 There were tactical
ideas all over the place, some of which were executed and some of which were
traps that both sides sidestepped. The game started out with White trying to
exert a Maroczy Bind positional squeeze, then Black trying (unsoundly) to free
himself, and White accurately playing to retain an extra Pawn and then launch
into a winning King side attack.
 
 Unfortunately White started losing the
thread, missing easy wins in favor of complicated but still winning ideas, then
at the critical moment thought the game was won and carelessly allowed Black a
resource that objectively should have resulted in a drawn Rook and Pawn ending.
But Black returned the favor and made a blunder that allowed White to
immediately win with the power of the Queen and Rook.
 
 The later parts of
the game were marred, I think, by time pressure and decreased energy. This is a practical consideration in long games.} 1-0
