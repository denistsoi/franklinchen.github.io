{I played this game during my final tournament of my childhood chess career, at
age 15, before starting the 11th grade in high school. I retired after this
tournament, to focus on academics during the final two years of high school.
This game was published in the Michigan Chess magazine. I was somewhat
embarrassed that it was published, and I never showed  off the game to my
father. Why was I "ashamed" of this "brilliant" game? I'll explain.} 1.e4
c5 2.Nf3 g6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Bg7 5.Nc3 a6 {
This looked unusual to me, falling behind in development. However, a theme
suddenly appeared in my head and I sank into deep thought. I spent probably
half an hour on the next move. My opponent became very uncomfortable and
probably confused. It turns out that I was calculating ten moves ahead!!}
6.Bc4 {!?} {
Objectively, this is clearly not the best move in this position, but at the
time, I had a suspicion about how my opponent would continue. Normally in a
serious tournament game I would not play this kind of "hope chess", but I had a
strong intuition that my opponent was going to reply as I wanted.}
( 6.Be3 {Noncommittal and good, and what I would play normally.} )
b5 {?} {Somehow I "knew" that my opponent would not resist the temptation to kick my Bishop.}
{%09DB} 7.Bd5 Ra7 8.Be3 {White is threatening a discovered attack on the Rook at a7 by Ndxb5 winning material.}
Rc7 {??} {The big losing move!} ( 8...b4 {The only move, really, to avoid losing. White still has a large advantage though.}
9.Nce2 ) 9.Bxf7+ {!} {BAM! Played instantly, since I had spent the half hour up front calculating variations. My opponent seemed totally confused.}
{%09DB} {%08DA} Kxf7 ( 9...Kf8 10.Ne6+ {White wins the Queen.} )
10.Ne6 {!!} {BAM! Played instantly again. My opponent still seemed bewildered. But he thought a long time and was visibly shaking.}
{%08DA} Bxc3+ {The only move.} ( 10...Kxe6 {??} {Loses to checkmate.}
11.Qd5+ Kf6 12.Bg5# ) 11.bxc3 Kxe6 12.Qd5+ Kf6 {%08DA} 13.Bd4+
{!} {The only way to continue after having sacrificed two pieces.}
e5 14.Bxe5+ Ke7 15.Bd6+ {The forced combination of moves is now complete and White has a won game because Black's Rooks on c7 and h8 are vulnerable.}
{%08DA} Ke8 {Black is dead no matter what, anyway.}
( 15...Kf6 16.Qe5+ Kf7 17.Qxh8 {%08DA} ) 16.Qe5+ Kf7 {%08DA}
17.Bxc7 {And White is up material and winning, although Black did not resign immediately
and the game continued on for some time before Black resigned.}
( 17.Qxh8 {Stronger, but it doesn't matter, since White is winning anyway.}
) {To the untrained eye, this game looks brilliant. I felt a little proud of it,
in the sense that I envisioned a forced winning combination, calculated it out
correctly, and executed it, but I felt somewhat like a fraud because I
completely stole the basic theme from somewhere. In fact, I stole it from a
game I remembered from my chess studies seven years earlier, when I was eight
years old: Fischer-Reshevsky, US Chess Championship 1958.} 1-0
