{This was only the second tournament game I've played against my opponent as White.} 1.c4
Nf6 2.Nc3 e6 3.d4 Bb4 {
The Nimzo-Indian, which I half-expected my opponent to play. I deliberately
invited it in an attempt to once again display the power of the two Bishops.}
{%08DA} 4.Qc2 c5 5.dxc5 Nc6 6.Nf3 {%08DA} Qa5 {?} {Premature activity.}
7.Bd2 Bxc3 {?} {Giving up the two Bishops, unforced.}
( 7...Qxc5 8.e3 {White has a good position because of Black's problematic d Pawn.}
{%08DA} ) 8.Qxc3 {!?} {A provocative attempt to expand on the Queen side.}
( 8.Bxc3 {A natural reply.} Qxc5 9.e3 {White has a big advantage.}
{%08DA} ) Qxc5 {%09DB} 9.b4 Qf5 10.b5 Ne7 {Has White overextended? White still has an advantage, but must finish King side development.}
{%08DA} 11.e3 {?!} {Too passive for the position at hand.}
( 11.g3 {Was best.} {%08DA} ) Ne4 {?!} {A wild sacrifice to create possible complications.}
( 11...b6 {Was fine for Black, limiting White's advantage.} {%08DA} )
12.Qxg7 {Have to accept the sacrifice, of course.} {%09DB} Rg8
13.Qe5 {Deciding to bail out into an endgame one Pawn up, just as I did in my previous two games in this tournament.}
( 13.Qd4 {Keeping a strong Queen was objectively best.} {%08DA} )
Qxe5 14.Nxe5 Nxd2 15.Kxd2 {
It should not be so easy for White to win this endgame, because of the problems
developing the King side. But there should also be no risk of losing.}
{%08DA} d6 {?} {Inaccurately driving White's Knight to a good square.}
( 15...b6 {Most natural.} {%08DA} 16.f3 ) 16.Nd3 b6 {%08DA} 17.Be2
{?!} {This allows considerable drawing chances for Black. but is safe for White.}
( 17.Rg1 {Natural and good. This was my original plan.} {%08DA}
Bb7 18.g4 {%08DA} ) Bb7 18.Bf3 Bxf3 19.gxf3 {Black should be able to just hold the draw now.}
{%08DA} O-O-O {?} 20.Rhg1 Nf5 {?} {%08DA} 21.Nf4 {!?} {Setting a little trap.}
( 21.a4 {Gives White an initiative on the Queen side.} {%08DA} )
Rxg1 22.Rxg1 {%08DA} d5 {?} {Fell into the trap!} ( 22...Nh4
23.Rg3 d5 {%08DA} 24.cxd5 Ng6 {This should be a draw.} {%08DA} )
23.cxd5 {%08DA} e5 {??} {Falling into the trap. Black will end up being two Pawns down and therefore lost.}
( 23...exd5 {??} 24.Rg5 {Black is lost now. The d, f, and h Pawns are so weak.}
{%08DA} ) ( 23...Ne7 24.e4 exd5 25.Ke3 {White has good winning chances because of the extra Pawn and strong King.}
{%08DA} ) 24.Rc1+ {One way to win.} ( 24.Nd3 {More direct way to win.}
{%08DA} Rxd5 {??} 25.e4 {White wins material with the fork.}
{%08DA} ) Kb7 {?} ( 24...Kd7 25.Nh5 {White stays two Pawns up.}
{%08DA} ) 25.Nd3 {The game is really over now, with Black two Pawns down for nothing.}
{%08DA} e4 {?} {
Trying to complicate things, and win the b Pawn, but the price is too high.
Giving White a full mass of center Pawns just helps White.} 26.fxe4
Nd6 27.f3 Rg8 {%08DA} 28.Nf4 {A pragmatic decision to not allow Black's Rook to come in at all.}
( 28.a4 {Ditching the h Pawn was possible.} Rg2+ 29.Kc3 Rxh2
30.e5 {An easy win for White.} {%08DA} ) Nxb5 29.Kd3 {So Black has won the b Pawn, but all White has to do is advance the center Pawns.}
{%08DA} Rd8 30.e5 {May not be the fastest way to win, but seemed easy and safe.}
Rd7 31.e4 {The position plays itself.} Nc7 32.Nh5 {%08DA} Na6
( 32...Nxd5 33.exd5 Rxd5+ 34.Ke4 Rd2 {Was the best swindling try.}
{%08DA} ) 33.Ke3 {No rush to force things.} Nc5 34.f4 a5 {OK, enough waiting by White.}
{%08DA} 35.Nf6 Rd8 36.Rg1 Rc8 37.Rg7 Na4 38.e6 {It's completely over now. White will Queen soon.}
{%08DA} {In this game, as White I achieved an opening advantage, then after winning a
Pawn let the advantage slide to the point of a possibly drawn endgame a Pawn
up, but this time chose to play safely and wait until the opportunity to win
came again, when Black fell into a trap. After that, I played safely to ensure the win.} 1-0
