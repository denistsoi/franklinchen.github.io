{This was the final round of the Pittsburgh Chess Club Championship 2013, and
entering it one point ahead of everyone else meant that no matter what, I would
at least tie for the title. Nevertheless, I promised Kurt several days ago that I was going to play hard for the win as Black.} 1.Nf3
c5 2.g3 Nc6 3.Bg2 e5 4.d3 d5 {I accepted the challenge of playing the White side of the King's Indian one tempo down.}
{%08DA} 5.O-O Be7 6.a3 {At this point, I fully expected White to attempt to play a reversed Benko Gambit with c4 and b4.}
{%08DA} g5 {!?} {Objectively risky, but for some reason, I felt very aggressive. I don't normally even play this way as White.}
{%08DA} 7.c4 d4 8.b4 g4 9.Ne1 {With the sensible plan of heading for c2.}
cxb4 10.axb4 Nxb4 {Since Black is so underdeveloped, objectively White clearly has some advantage in this Benko Gambit type of position.}
{%08DA} 11.Qb3 {?} {An inaccuracy. I did not see a threat based on this move.}
h5 {?!} {Pretty crazy, actually. Black should have started catching up on development.}
{%08DA} ( 11...Nf6 {Black would have been safe after just developing and castling.}
{%08DA} ) 12.e3 {?!} {The wrong Pawn break.} ( 12.f4 {As I mentioned after the game, this Pawn break was what I most feared, aiming to break up Black's center and aim at the King.}
{%08DA} ) Nh6 {?} {Trying to develop, but too slow.}
( 12...h4 {!} {Continuing the King side attack against White was actually best here.}
{%08DA} 13.exd4 hxg3 14.hxg3 Qxd4 {Black is OK. White must make sure Black does not swing the Queen over to h5.}
{%08DA} ) 13.exd4 exd4 {I was not very happy with this position as Black. Black needs many moves in order to escape to safety.}
{%08DA} 14.Nc2 a5 15.Re1 Nxc2 16.Qxc2 Ra6 {Black is desperately trying to protect everything.}
{%08DA} 17.Bd5 {?!} {
White still has an advantage, by preventing Re6, but not preventing Black from
castling to safety. The Bishop will prove to be a target in the future since it is only protected by the Pawn on c4.}
( 17.Na3 Re6 18.Bf4 {White has a very strong position. Black's a5 Pawn is particularly weak and should fall eventually.}
{%08DA} ) Nf5 18.Na3 O-O {At this point, I felt that I could survive the position, even though clearly White still has an advantage.}
{%08DA} 19.Nb5 Rg6 {The question is, how can White break through?}
{%08DA} 20.Bf4 b6 21.Re5 Bf6 22.Re2 Bg7 {The defensive task has been very difficult for Black, who is objectively on the verge of falling apart.}
{%08DA} 23.Bc7 {?} {The beginning of a poor plan that allows Black to finally catch up in development.}
Qd7 24.Rb1 {?} Ba6 {Black is now out of danger of losing.} {%08DA}
25.Be5 {?} {A final error that concedes equality to Black.} Rc8
{Finally Black's pieces are all well-placed and everything is protected.}
{%08DA} 26.Qd2 Rc5 {White should not be able to make any progress now.}
{%08DA} 27.Qa2 {??} {Simply blunders away material.}
( 27.Bxg7 Kxg7 28.Qf4 Rxd5 29.cxd5 Bxb5 30.Rxb5 Qxb5 31.Qxf5
{This should be a draw.} {%08DA} ) Rxd5 28.cxd5 Bxb5 {White is dead lost. His only chance is to somehow use the two Rooks to create threats against Black's King.}
{%08DA} 29.Bxg7 Kxg7 30.Re5 Bxd3 31.Rbe1 {The question is, how should Black consolidate?}
{%08DA} Ba6 {?} {Going for the d5 Pawn, but very slow.}
( 31...Qc7 {
Heading actively for c3 is very strong. White cannot break through anywhere on
the board, while Black only needs to advance Pawns for victory.}
{%08DA} ) 32.Qa3 {Obviously trying to get to f8.} {%08DA} Bb7
{?!} ( 32...Bc4 {A more active way to win the Pawn on d5.} {%08DA} )
33.Qd3 {%08DA} Rf6 {?!} ( 33...Rg5 {The most active and accurate, with the plan of f6 kicking away White's Rook.}
{%08DA} ) 34.Qe4 Kg6 {?!} {This self-pin was pointless.}
( 34...b5 {
Simplest. I did consider just holding on the King side and advancing the Queen
side Pawns, but thought I would try to win the d5 Pawn instead.}
{%08DA} 35.Qf4 Kg6 {%08DA} 36.h4 gxh3 37.f3 Bxd5 38.g4 d3 {Black is fine with giving up the Knight on f5, because all the advanced Pawns will tell in the end.}
{%08DA} ) 35.h4 {!?} {A good try.} {%08DA} Rd6 {Winning the d5 Pawn should do the trick.}
{%08DA} 36.Qf4 {%08DA} f6 {A simple way to win.} ( 36...Rxd5
{A different way to win, but I just did not want to calculate the ramifications of a check on g5.}
{%08DA} 37.Qg5+ Kh7 38.Qxh5+ Nh6 {Black's loss of the h Pawn is meaningless because fatal threats down the a8 to h1 diagonal will force a winning trade.}
{%08DA} ) 37.Re6 {??} {Black wins instantly now.} {%08DA}
( 37.Rxf5 {I'd expected White to trade into a lost endgame.}
Qxf5 38.Qxd6 Qxd5 39.Qxd5 Bxd5 {Black sacrificed some material back in order to gain a totally won endgame with three passed Pawns.}
{%08DA} ) Rxe6 38.Rxe6 Qxd5 {With a deadly mating threat.} {%08DA}
39.Qg5+ Kh7 40.Qxh5+ Kg7 {White resigned, seeing that useful checks have run out.}
{%08DA} {This was an intense fighting game. I wasn't happy with how I ended up with
such a difficult defensive task out of the opening, and will never play that
opening experiment again, but I was proud of hanging on until equalizing, and
then seized a winning advantage after a tactical blunder, and managed to
navigate time pressure to a win. And with that, I won clear first in the Pittsburgh Chess Club Championship 2013!} 0-1
