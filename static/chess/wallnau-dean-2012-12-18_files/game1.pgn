{I was present to watch only part of this game, but I got the score (as far as
it existed until mutual time pressure) from both players. Black wrote a blog
post and own analysis about the game at
http://www.unwantedcapture.org/2012/12/22/pcc-smith-memorial-round-6/ but I
analyzed this game before seeing his analysis. You may find it interesting to compare our independent analyses.} 1.e4
d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 c6 {%08DA} 4.Nf3 Bg4 5.Be3 Nbd7 6.a4 Qa5 7.h3
Bh5 8.Bd3 Bg6 {?} {Black is falling dangerously behind in development.}
{%08DA} 9.O-O e6 {Aiming eventually for d5.} {%08DA} 10.Qe2
( 10.Nh4 {Personally, I would just grab the two Bishops already.} )
Be7 11.Bd2 Qh5 {?} {The Queen is in danger of being trapped or something here.}
{%08DA} 12.Qe3 {!} {A very strong move, with ideas of trapping Black's Queen through Ne2 etc.}
{%08DA} O-O {%08DA} 13.Be2 {?!} {White played this move with a followup that he then realized did not work.}
( 13.Ne2 {The move I expected White to play, which wins a Pawn by force.}
{%08DA} e5 14.a5 {%03!} {
Preventing Black's Queen from getting back to a5. The threat is to play c3 to
protect d4 from freeing tactics, then play Ng3 forcing Black's Queen to h6. Black will lose a Pawn one way or another.}
{%08DA} ) Qa5 {Escaping just in time.} 14.Nh4 ( 14.Nd5 {?} {This trick to get the e7 Bishop does not work because of White's Queen being on e3.}
Nxd5 {%08DA} ) Qc7 15.Nxg6 hxg6 16.a5 {White's position is still very strong, with the two Bishops as well as considerable space advantage.}
{%08DA} b5 {!?} {Playing a move that a5 is supposed to prevent.}
{%08DA} 17.Kh1 {?} {Justifying Black's previous move. White's previous move a5 has no point if Black can successfully play b5. Black is OK now.}
( 17.axb6 {The consistent continuation.} axb6 18.d5 {
Breaking in the center with a positional Pawn sacrifice is thematic, with a
long-term advantage to White. Black will end up with a weak Pawn structure no matter what.}
{%08DA} exd5 19.exd5 cxd5 20.Qd4 Qc5 21.Be3 {
Black's weak b Pawn and d Pawns mean that once White regains a Pawn and opens
up the game with his two Bishops, he will be in a strong position.}
{%08DA} ) e5 ( 17...b4 {Getting immediate Queen side counterplay was good.}
{%08DA} ) 18.f4 {?!} {An attempt at an attack, but loosening. White is still OK, but his position is starting to look shakier and shakier.}
Nh5 ( 18...b4 {Black could also liquidate White's center immediately.}
19.Na4 d5 {%08DA} ) 19.Bxh5 exd4 20.Qxd4 gxh5 {
White has not only lost the two Bishop advantage, but has also fixed Black's
doubled g Pawns! The game is now completely equal. Except for one thing: White
spent a huge amount of time in the opening trying to come up with a way to
punish Black's opening play, and therefore is considerably behind on the clock.
I completely stopped watching the game at this point because I was attending to
my own game in progress, which I annotated at
http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/12/18/round-6-of-pittsburgh-chess-club-tournament-playing-pragmatically/}
{%08DA} 21.Qf2 Bf6 22.b4 a6 23.Qf3 h4 {Both sides are holding their positions.}
{%08DA} 24.Rad1 Be7 {?!} {Passive. Black will need to move the Bishop back later.}
25.Be1 ( 25.Be3 {More active, but it doesn't seem that White can really make progress in this position anyway.}
{%08DA} ) Rae8 26.Bf2 Bf6 {Black is putting pressure on White's e4 Pawn. This is a critical position.}
{%08DA} 27.Rfe1 ( 27.e5 {%03!} {
This thematic positional sacrifice, clearing the way for White's Knight to e4
and forcing Black to occupy his own e5 square and therefore seal it from his own Knight, Bishop, and Rook, was best.}
{%08DA} dxe5 28.f5 {%08DA} Be7 29.Ne4 Nf6 30.Bb6 Qb7 31.Nxf6+
Bxf6 32.Bc5 Be7 33.f6 {!} {White wins the exchange for a second Pawn.}
{%08DA} Bxf6 34.Bxf8 Kxf8 35.Rd6 {White looks winning here. Black's King is unsafe.}
{%08DA} ) Re6 28.Qd3 {?} Rfe8 {??} {A losing blunder thanks to the unprotected Knight on d7.}
29.e5 {!} {%08DA} Be7 {??} {Loses instantly.} ( 29...dxe5 30.Qxd7
{Wins the Knight.} ) 30.Ne4 {??} {Missing the win and accepting equality again.}
( 30.exd6 {%08DA} Bxd6 31.Rxe6 Rxe6 32.f5 {Wins material decisively.}
{%08DA} Ne5 33.Qd4 Rh6 34.Be3 {Black loses material because of White's threats against the Bishop at d6 and the Rook at h6.}
{%08DA} ) d5 {%08DA} 31.Nc5 {?} {Now playing for the loss. White has only losing chances after this move, which weakens his Pawn structure permanently.}
( 31.c3 {An even position.} {%08DA} ) Nxc5 {Not best.}
( 31...Bxc5 32.bxc5 f6 {Black has a strong advantage. White's Pawn structure is in shambles, with the isolated a Pawn and doubled c Pawns.}
{%08DA} ) 32.bxc5 Bd8 33.Bd4 {%08DA} g6 {?!} {Solid but slow, with the aim of completely blocking up White's possible King side attack. A pragmatic decision.}
( 33...f6 {
Striking against e5 immediately was good. White should still be able to hold, I
think, but it is Black who then has the attack.} {%08DA} 34.Re3
( 34.f5 {??} Rxe5 35.Bxe5 fxe5 {Black gives up the exchange for a Pawn and has a very strong position.}
{%08DA} ) ) 34.Rf1 f5 {Black's position is solid now, if passive.}
{%08DA} 35.exf6 {?!} {
Trying to keep chances of breaking through. But there is risk in opening up the
position. Realistically, it is Black who has the winning chances after his Rooks are activated.}
( 35.Rf3 {The reality is that White cannot break through on the King side.}
{%08DA} ) Re4 {Choosing to continue the pragmatic course of keeping things blocked.}
( 35...Bxf6 {Was OK.} 36.f5 ( 36.Qxg6+ {?} Qg7 {Black is actually slightly better after this Pawn sacrifice because of White's weak Pawns and inactive Rooks.}
{%08DA} ) gxf5 37.Qxf5 Bg7 {Black holds.} {%08DA} ) 36.Be5 {?!}
{It was probably best to get the f4 Pawn off an attackable dark square when there was the chance.}
( 36.f5 g5 {Black will eventually regain the Pawn with a reasonable position.}
{%08DA} ) Qf7 37.Rde1 Rxe1 38.Rxe1 Bxf6 {
White should be able to hold, but Black's side is easier to play, just because
of White's long-term Pawn weaknesses on the Queen side.} {%08DA}
39.Rf1 ( 39.Re3 {Keeps e5 completely defended.} ) Bd8 {
Pressure is mounting on White. White should still be able to hold, but when in
time pressure, anything can happen when you are on the defensive.}
{%08DA} 40.Qd4 Re6 41.Rg1 {?} {Passive.} {%08DA} Bf6 42.Re1 {
Both players told me they were in severe time trouble at this point, so no
record of the remaining moves exist. The position should really be a draw.
However, White blundered at some point and lost, being in worse time trouble.}
{%08DA} {A tough game in which Black was almost losing for a while out of the opening,
but hung on and reached a positionally superior position because of White's
weak Pawn structure. The game was still blocked up and even, nevertheless, but
time pressure finally led White, who had the looser position, to blunder.} 0-1
