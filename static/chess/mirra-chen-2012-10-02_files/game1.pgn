{I learned some days before tonight's game that my opponent and I were going to
be paired. Based on my memory, and my database of games, I expected my opponent
to play the English. In our last game, in 2010, he had played the English. I
planned to avoid the variation that I had played then, because of course he
would be prepared for it. Our game tonight ended up one-sided, but it is still
instructive, for those who are not familiar with Benoni-style middle games.} 1.c4
Nf6 {I varied immediately from how I responded to the English in our game in 2010.}
2.g3 e6 3.Bg2 d5 4.b3 {Now we are in a Reti.} {%08DA} c5 {I decided not to accept the gambit.}
( 4...dxc4 5.bxc4 Qd4 6.Nc3 {Giving up the Pawn for development.}
( 6.Qa4+ {?} {Trying to get complicated just backfires.} Bd7
7.Qb3 Qxa1 8.Bxb7 Bd6 {%08DA} 9.Bxa8 Na6 10.Qb2 Qxb2 11.Bxb2
c6 {White is dead.} {%08DA} ) Qxc4 {%09DB} 7.Bb2 {White has sufficient compensation for the Pawn. I did not feel like entering this variation as Black.}
{%08DA} ) 5.Nf3 Nc6 6.Bb2 {?!} {A positional error, in my opinion.}
d4 {!} {The perfect time to go into a reversed Benoni structure. White's Bishop on b2 is doing nothing useful.}
{%08DA} 7.O-O Be7 8.d3 O-O 9.Na3 e5 10.Nc2 Bf5 {With the idea of eventually playing e4.}
{%08DA} 11.a3 {Continuing to play for b4, but this plan is slow.}
a5 {Of course.} 12.Bc1 {?} {A critical waste of time. White's position is already becoming very unpleasant.}
h6 {Thematic move stopping White from getting to g5.} {%08DA}
13.Bd2 {?} {White's pieces are on very bad squares now.}
( 13.Nd2 {Was required, to stop e4.} {%08DA} ) Qd7 {A little slow, but I wanted to wait one more move, to see what White's plan is, before playing e4.}
( 13...e4 14.Nfe1 {Black has an overwhelming position and can continue in many ways.}
{%08DA} ) 14.Rb1 {?} {Still trying for b4, but tactically this will not work.}
e4 {%08DA} 15.dxe4 {?} {White is positionally lost, I think, after this move.}
( 15.Nfe1 {The only move, holding d3.} {%08DA} ) Nxe4 {%08DA}
16.Be1 {?} {The game is over now.} Rfd8 {With terrible threats.}
{%08DA} 17.b4 {?} {A break of desperation.} axb4 18.axb4 Nc3
{!} {Game over, man!} {%08DA} 19.Bxc3 dxc3 20.Qxd7 Rxd7 {%08DA}
21.Ra1 ( 21.b5 Nb4 {%08DA} ) Rxa1 22.Nxa1 cxb4 {White is a Pawn up, has connected passed b and c Pawns, and will surely promote soon.}
{%08DA} 23.Nb3 Bc2 {%08DA} 24.Na1 Bd1 {%08DA} 25.e3 b3 26.Nd4
Nxd4 {%08DA} 27.Rxd1 Ne2+ {White resigned, and immediately declared that he had been "emasculated" for the whole game.}
{%08DA} {After the game, my opponent and I discussed the errors that he made during the
game: I considered that allowing the reverse Benoni after b3 and Bb2 was an
error, and then after that, failing to prevent e4 with Nd2 was an error. He
noted that he had prepared for our game by studying our game in 2010 and had
improved his understanding of the opening variation we had played then, but I
told him that I, too, had looked at the game, and never planned to walk into
his preparation. I congratulated him for doing his homework, and having
improved so much in the past couple of years, and he said he learns from his
mistakes. Bravo! I have no doubt that he will study the opening we played today
and be ready in the future not just for me, but anyone who plays how I did today.} 0-1
