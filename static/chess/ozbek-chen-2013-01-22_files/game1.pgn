{My first game as Black against my opponent.} 1.e4 c5 2.Nc3 Nc6
3.f4 g6 4.Nf3 Bg7 5.Bb5 Nd4 6.O-O a6 7.Bc4 e6 8.d3 b5 9.Bb3 Bb7
{As Black, I was pretty happy with this Grand Prix Attack position. The question
is, can White break through with the thematic f5?} {%08DA} 10.Qe1
( 10.f5 gxf5 {White has nothing.} ) Ne7 {?} ( 10...f5 {Immediate f5 would have been good.}
) 11.Nxd4 Bxd4+ 12.Be3 {The position is equal now.} {%08DA} Nc6
{?!} {Maintaining tension.} ( 12...Bxe3+ 13.Qxe3 Qb6 {%08DA} )
13.Kh1 {Preparing f5, but slow.} ( 13.Nd1 {White could have avoided simplification to try for an advantage.}
{%08DA} ) ( 13.f5 {?} Qg5 {My opponent saw this and that is why he played Kh1.}
{%08DA} ) f5 {A critical decision, indicating that Black is not just defending any more, but may try an attack.}
{%08DA} 14.Qf2 O-O 15.exf5 gxf5 {Black now has chances to attack White at g2.}
{%08DA} 16.Ne2 {Very interesting idea to trade the b Pawn for Black's c Pawn.}
( 16.Nd1 {Related idea that does not drop the b Pawn.} {%08DA} )
Bxb2 {%09DB} 17.Rae1 {!?} {Trying to confuse Black with complications.}
( 17.Bxc5 {The natural trade I expected.} Bxa1 18.Bxf8 Qxf8 19.Rxa1
Qg7 20.Rg1 Ne7 {After the simplification, the position is quite even. Black does not have enough forces to break through on g2.}
{%08DA} ) Rf7 {!?} {Somewhat risky, but avoiding simplification.}
( 17...Bd4 {Trading everything off is fine, but boring.} {%08DA} )
18.Bxc5 Bf6 {Black still should not be able to break through.}
{%08DA} 19.Rd1 Rg7 20.Rg1 {%08DA} Kh8 {Preparing to bring the other Rook into play.}
( 20...Qe8 {Immediately going for White's King was most direct.} )
21.a4 {White has to act quickly.} Qe8 {%08DA} 22.axb5 {?} {Opening the a file was not wise.}
( 22.d4 ) axb5 23.d4 Qg6 24.d5 Na5 25.dxe6 Nxb3 26.cxb3 dxe6
27.Nd4 {After the end of a forced variation, Black has increased his advantage. But
after much thinking, I could not find an immediate win.} {%08DA}
Bd5 {Played as a "safety" move to wait and see what White does.}
( 27...Qh5 {Best. I looked at this move threatening to take on g2 but it did not win even if it was objectively best.}
{%08DA} 28.Nf3 Rxg2 29.Kxg2 Ra2 30.Rd3 Rxf2+ 31.Kxf2 {"Winning" White's Queen for two Rooks looked drawn.}
{%08DA} ) 28.h3 {??} {
I was sure my opponent's move here would lose, but missed the killer reply. He
was running out of time on the clock, and I was starting to run low as well.}
{%09DB} ( 28.Nxb5 Bxb3 {White can hold.} {%08DA} ) Rag8 {Played as a natural "safety" move in time pressure.}
{%09DB} ( 28...Ra2 {!!} {Wins!} {%08DA} 29.Qxa2 Qg3 {Black has a deadly threat of mate.}
{%08DA} ) ( 28...Qh5 {Even without my finding the big win, this natural move would have been strong.}
{%08DA} 29.Rd3 Be4 30.Re3 Bxg2+ {%08DA} 31.Rxg2 {??} {%08DA}
Ra1+ 32.Kh2 Qd1 {Nice cornering of the White King.} {%08DA} )
29.Rd2 {??} {A losing move.} ( 29.Nf3 {White had to stop the attack on g2.}
Bxb3 {Black has won a clean Pawn.} {%08DA} ) Qh5 {%08DA} 30.Kh2
{??} {The game should be over now, but I started getting weird in time pressure.}
{%08DA} e5 {?} {Move order mistake throwing away the win.}
( 30...Bh4 {The move I intended to play.} 31.g3 Bxg3+ 32.Rxg3
Rxg3 33.Qxg3 Rxg3 34.Kxg3 e5 {!} {I saw this position, but changed up the move order.}
{%08DA} 35.fxe5 {??} {Hangs the Rook.} ( 35.Nc2 {??} {Also hangs the Rook.}
Qf3+ {%08DA} ) Qg5+ ) 31.Nc2 {??} {Loses.} ( 31.Nf3 {White holds.}
{%08DA} ) Bh4 {%08DA} 32.Qe3 {%08DA} exf4 {??} {Still wins, but the beginning of many blunders in time pressure.}
( 32...Bg3+ {Obvious and winning.} 33.Qxg3 Rxg3 34.Rxd5 Qe2 {And mate in three.}
{%08DA} ) 33.Qxf4 {
At the point, neither player was keeping score any more. Luckily, right after
the game, I was able to reconstruct the score for the rest of the game.}
{%08DA} Bg3+ 34.Qxg3 Rxg3 {%08DA} 35.Rxd5 {??} ( 35.Bd4+ R3g7
{Black still has a decisive material advantage.} {%08DA} ) Rxh3+
{!} {I thought I saw a win here, and there is, but not what I saw!!}
{%08DA} 36.gxh3 Qe2+ 37.Kh1 {%08DA} Qf3+ ( 37...Qe4+ {Using a checking trick to pick up the Knight on c2 wins.}
38.Kh2 Qxc2+ 39.Kh1 Qe4+ 40.Kh2 Qxd5 {White is lost.} {%08DA} )
38.Kh2 {Black can transpose into the Knight-winning variation, but did not.}
{%08DA} Rxg1 {??} {Throwing away the win. White should be able to hold this ending.}
39.Rd8+ Kg7 40.Kxg1 Qg3+ {%08DA} 41.Kh1 {?} {Pointlessly losing an extra Pawn.}
( 41.Kf1 ) Qxh3+ 42.Kg1 Qxb3 {
White is OK, but with both players down to seconds on the clock, I think it is
easier to play Black, who can check with the Queen at will.}
{%08DA} 43.Bd4+ {??} {Loses. White is leaving his Knight on c2 hanging.}
Kf7 {%08DA} 44.Rd7+ {??} {Loses quickly. Just driving Black's King closer, and also missing a tactic.}
( 44.Ne3 f4 {Black will win because of the Pawns that can advance.}
{%08DA} 45.Nf1 Qe6 {%08DA} ) Ke6 45.Rc7 {??} Qg3+ {White loses the Rook. It's over.}
{%08DA} 46.Kf1 Qxc7 {At this point, White touched his King, and then resigned.}
{%08DA} 0-1
