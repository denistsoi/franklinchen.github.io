<p>So I started another <a href="http://pittsburghcc.org/">Pittsburgh Chess Club</a> 6-round Tuesday night tournament, the 16th Robert P. Smith Memorial. (I reported on my previous Tuesday night tournament <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/10/09/final-round-of-pittsburgh-chess-club-tournament-clawing-back-from-a-terrible-position-to-draw-and-tie-for-first/">here</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="today-s-lesson">Today&rsquo;s lesson</h2>

<p>In my game for round 1, we see the power of a good Knight, especially in contrast to a bad Bishop.</p>

<h2 id="the-complete-annotated-game">The complete annotated game</h2>

<p>At your convenience, you can <a href="../../../../../chess/sax-chen-2012-11-13.htm">enjoy playing over the game with my annotations, including diagrams.</a></p>

<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>

<p>Since this was round 1, there was no telling in advance who my opponent would be. So I had no preparation other than just having played a <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/11/11/pittsburgh-chess-league-round-3-back-to-chess-after-a-month-off/">Pittsburgh Chess League game on Sunday</a>. Surprisingly, that experience did prove useful in my game, as I will explain.</p>

<h3 id="strength">Strength</h3>

<p>I expected to be the highest-rated player in the tournament again, <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/09/04/round-1-of-the-pittsburgh-chess-club-tournament-the-greek-gift-sacrifice/">as in the last one</a>, so I expected that round 1 would pair me against someone considerably lower-rated than me. As usual, however, I <em>respect</em> all of my opponents, regardless of rating. Upsets do happen, especially when one does not take an opponent seriously.</p>

<p>It turned out that I was paired against someone I had never actually met before, much less played against. I enjoyed this situation, as it meant <em>unpredictability</em>. There is something to be said for the pleasures of refining one&rsquo;s way of playing against an opponent one has faced before, but there is also something to be said for totally real-time improvisation.</p>

<p>The game ended up long, taking over three hours to complete. It wasn&rsquo;t just a quick and easy win, despite my opponent being 500 rating points lower than me.</p>

<h2 id="overview-of-my-game">Overview of my game</h2>

<h3 id="the-opening">The opening</h3>

<p>As I had Black, I was of course much more limited in my choice of opening than I am as White. As I did in <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/09/12/round-2-of-the-pittsburgh-chess-club-tournament-winning-in-the-sicilian-defense-the-philosophy-and-psychology-of-struggle/">round 2 of the previous tournament</a>, I countered <code>e4</code> with the aggressive Sicilian Defense.</p>

<p>My opponent played the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_Attack#Grand_Prix_Attack">Grand Prix Attack</a>. White&rsquo;s goal in this variation is to focus on launching a King side attack against Black, by playing an early <code>f4</code>, with the plan of eventually playing <code>f5</code>, bringing the White Queen to <code>e1</code> and <code>h4</code>, etc. This attack often works effectively on weaker players, but objectively, Black can defend against it.</p>

<p>He chose an unusual sub-variation I had not seen before, <code>Bd3</code>, after which I made a positionally rather risky decision that I would not make again, but just happened to feel like engaging in at the time: I decided to develop my King Knight not to a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; square such as <code>f6</code>, but to the &ldquo;rim&rdquo; at <code>h6</code> instead:</p>

    <figcaption>
        <h4>Knight on h6</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>My justification was that I wanted the option of playing my own attack with <code>f5</code>. I was in the mood for dynamic complications rather than a more sedate middle game:</p>

    <figcaption>
        <h4>After f5</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<h3 id="the-middle">The middle</h3>

<p>White made a strategic mistake in allowing my Knight on <code>h6</code> to get to a great outpost on <code>f5</code>:</p>

        <img src="../../../../../chess/sax-chen-2012-11-13_files/diag3FEEA315583EFCC5.gif" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Knight on f5</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>The position was still roughly equal at this point, but gradually White made more inaccurate moves, ceding an advantage to me. In fact, by the position, I already had a won game (but missed the best continuation):</p>

        <img src="../../../../../chess/sax-chen-2012-11-13_files/diag3FEEA375BB2E5EA8.gif" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>White is actually lost</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>Note how poor White&rsquo;s Bishop on <code>d2</code> is, while Black&rsquo;s Knight on <code>f5</code> is clearly the strongest of all the remaining minor pieces (four Bishops and two Knights).</p>

<p>In the following position, I have just played the Pawn advance <code>e4</code>:</p>

    <figcaption>
        <h4>e4 advance by Black</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<h3 id="the-good-knight">The good Knight</h3>

<p>Perhaps White had thought that I would play <code>Ne3</code> trading my Knight for White&rsquo;s Bishop on <code>d2</code>. No! I was not going to make the mistake again of thoughtlessly trading a good Knight for a bad Bishop, the way <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/11/11/pittsburgh-chess-league-round-3-back-to-chess-after-a-month-off/">I just reported on doing so on Sunday</a>! Both common sense and tactical calculation rebel against such an idea.</p>

<p>In fact, in the game I proceeded to make White&rsquo;s bad Bishop even worse:</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="../../../../../chess/sax-chen-2012-11-13_files/diag3FEEA3B5152816D7.gif" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>White&#39;s Bishop back on c1</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<h2 id="the-end">The end</h2>

<p>In the final blow in the game, I set a trap, offering White a &ldquo;free&rdquo; Pawn, which he mistakenly took (but I had a completely won position anyway; this is not &ldquo;hope chess&rdquo; where an idea only works if you hope your opponent falls into a trap). I moved the Knight from <code>f5</code> to <code>d6</code>, not only threatening White&rsquo;s Rook, but also with the intention of redeploying the Knight to <code>e4</code> and then <code>f2</code>. And I did so.</p>

<p>White struggled on for a few more bizarre moves before resigning:</p>

        <h4>White resigned</h4>

<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h2>

<ul>
<li>Because of my game on Sunday (and reflections on previous games before that), I was very conscious of the power of the Knight and wanted to use it well.</li>
<li>My anti-positional <code>f5</code> idea &ldquo;worked&rdquo;, and created an interesting position and middle game out of which I did well, but I feel guilty about having played this milder version of &ldquo;hope chess&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Sometimes it&rsquo;s not clear to a bystander how much thought actually goes into a <em>sound</em> attack, because the vast majority of calculations during an attack inevitably go into thinking about possible continuations that <em>never happen</em> during the game, but must be evaluated in case they do happen. (See the annotations for some details of the alternative lines that did not happen.)</li>
<li>I did miss a faster, more immediate win (see the annotations for details); this is something I sometimes do when I have a clear advantage and end up with a little bit of tunnel vision in which I initially see <em>too many</em> good moves, and instead of investigating them all thoroughly, I investigate one, decide it is good, and then go with it. How to zoom in more effectively is an ongoing problem to solve.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-next">What next?</h2>

<p>Next week for round 2 I will get a stronger opponent, but play White. For reasons I&rsquo;ll explain after the fact, I&rsquo;m thinking of playing completely differently with White than I have in the past Tuesday night tournament and in the Pittsburgh Chess League so far! Stay tuned. I want to explore some themes so that I can write about them.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I got off to a good start in the Tuesday night tournament with an interesting game in which I played a fairly precise attack. And I was happy, after abusing my Knight in Sunday&rsquo;s game, to make my Knight the hero of the first Tuesday night round. I must remember to love each of my pieces in each game I play.</p>
