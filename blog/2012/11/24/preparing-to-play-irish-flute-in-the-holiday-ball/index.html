<p>A very important event for me last year was joining Abby in playing music at the annual <a href="http://pittsburghcontra.org/">Pittsburgh Contras and Squares</a> Holiday Ball at the Swisshelm Park Community Center as part of the &ldquo;Holiday Ball Orchestra&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Today I started to prepare to play music for the Holiday Ball (Friday, December 14) again: I have three weeks to practice.</p>

<p>What progress have I made in the past year on the <a href="../../../../../blog/2011/12/16/playing-recorder-and-flute-at-the-holiday-ball/">goals I listed after last year&rsquo;s event</a>?</p>

<h2 id="improvement-at-instruments">Improvement at instruments</h2>

<p>Last year, I wrote: &ldquo;I want to be much better at all the instruments I would play in it (recorder, flute, tin whistle)&rdquo;.</p>

<p>My status this year:</p>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m better at <a href="../../../../../categories/recorder/">recorder</a>.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m much better at <a href="../../../../../categories/flute/">flute</a>.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve only barely worked on <a href="../../../../../categories/tin-whistle/">tin whistle</a>, but am automatically better at it because of getting better at other instruments.</li>
<li>I unexpectedly got an <a href="../../../../../categories/irish-flute/">Irish flute</a>, which I have mostly been playing for <a href="../../../../../categories/french-dance/">French dance</a>, but which <strong>I intend to be my main instrument for the Holiday Ball</strong>!</li>
</ul>

<p>From a sound and style point of view, the Irish flute is clearly the best of my instruments to use for the Holiday Ball. So I read through my copies of the Holiday Ball music (lots of jigs, reels, waltzes) tonight at speed, to see where I stand.</p>

<p>Last year, I could play (on any instrument) barely any of the music at speed, even on my best instrument at the time, which was soprano recorder. I was reduced to sitting out some tunes or playing just a single note each measure, when I otherwise would have been unable to continue.</p>

<p>Today, I found that I could get through most of the selections OK at speed, but somewhat sloppily and inaccurately. I would <em>not</em> be happy to have to perform this music at speed tonight; I would rather sit out or simplify rather than try to play something beyond me. But I have three weeks to improve significantly, and I believe I can improve enough that when the time comes, I won&rsquo;t be sitting out most of the tunes the way I kind of did last year.</p>

<p>Since the fingering of the tin whistle is the same as for my keyless Irish flute, I can also choose to use the tin whistle where I feel appropriate.</p>

<h2 id="microphone">Microphone</h2>

<p>Last year, I wrote: &ldquo;I want to be proficient and confident enough to sit by a microphone&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The idea of being in the foreground is still a bit daunting to me, but I think after I get in some good practice over the next week or so, I&rsquo;ll feel confident about not just being in the background the way I was last year. I do think it would be nice to have an audible Irish flute in our performance for the dancers.</p>

<h2 id="solos">Solos</h2>

<p>Last year, I wrote: &ldquo;I want to do some solos, with stylistically appropriate improvisations&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Even scarier. I&rsquo;ve been working through <a href="../../../../../blog/_posts/2012/06/12/ordered-the-casey-burns-small-handed-irish-flute/">Grey Larsen&rsquo;s book</a>, which is amazingly detailed and good, but as Irish music has <em>not</em> at all been my focus during this year of music for me, I&rsquo;m nowhere at the level of passing for a traditional Irish musician. Still, there is time to work up a sound basic practical level of ornamentation, I think.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll have to evaluate, after a week or two, what I feel comfortable doing on stage. The basic rule is: better to play an melody simply and beautifully, unornamented, rather than do something badly and in poor taste and technique!</p>

<h2 id="dance">Dance</h2>

<p>Last year, I wrote: &ldquo;Maybe I should learn some of the dances and perform some too&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It turns out that in fact, I did learn some <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/10/07/my-first-contra-dance-workshop-unexpected-fun/">contra dance</a>, so depending on how Abby would like to split up playing music and dancing, I would be, unlike last year, totally up for participating as a dancer as well as a musician.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I had a lot of fun playing music at the Holiday Ball last year and hope to enjoy it again, and this time with a higher level of musicality and a higher level of contribution.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re in the Pittsburgh area and like contra dancing, make sure to put Friday, December 14 on your calendar already, and come to the Holiday Ball!</p>
