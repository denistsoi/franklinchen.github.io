<p><a href="../../../../../blog/2012/11/02/attending-the-annual-pitt-jazz-seminar-for-the-first-time-day-1/">Yesterday</a>, I attended some morning sessions of the annual Pitt Jazz Seminar. I went back for more today.</p>

<h2 id="a-tribute-to-miles">A tribute to Miles</h2>

<h3 id="randy-brecker-http-randybrecker-com-trumpet"><a href="http://randybrecker.com/">Randy Brecker</a>, trumpet</h3>

<p>I liked how Randy Brecker talked about how he got into music. He listened to a lot of records as a kid, and at some point he started improvising during piano solos, by ear. He started with ballads (by Miles, Chet, etc.) and played with his brother <a href="http://www.michaelbrecker.com/">Michael</a> (who sadly died some years ago).</p>

<h3 id="lew-soloff-http-www-lewsoloff-com-trumpet"><a href="http://www.lewsoloff.com/">Lew Soloff</a>, trumpet</h3>

<p>Lew Soloff came from a very different world. He stopped piano lessons at ten because his teachers did not emphasize <em>music</em>, but &ldquo;holding the hand a certain way&rdquo;. He wanted trumpet because it was <em>shiny</em>. Ha! Reminded me that it doesn&rsquo;t matter why you start doing something; often you have a perhaps superficial reason, and find deeper reasons later.</p>

<p>His uncle emphasized the importance of <em>practice</em> and admonished him for being interested in too many things. Some tips on mental attitudes: never say &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&rdquo;, and also drop your <em>ego</em>: learn from your peers. So in one summer, he went from last chair to first chair, practicing one and a half hours each day!</p>

<p>Lew had a classical music training and therefore at first was scared to improvise. He had to overcome that fear. He also had to learn to articulate in &ldquo;doodle tongue&rdquo; rather than in the classical way.</p>

<p>He said he eventually became open to all kinds of music, where in the past he was closed. He has a different take than Duke Ellington&rsquo;s famous quote, &ldquo;There are two kinds of music, good music and the other kind&rdquo;: instead, Lew likes to think that the two kinds are the <em>honest</em> and <em>dishonest</em>. I like this formulation.</p>

<p>(Randy piped in saying that he became musically open because that was just the way things were in Philadelphia, where there are so many styles.)</p>

<p>Advice: when learning ballads, first play them <em>without</em> improvisation, focusing on purity and honesty, and expressing emotion as though singing. Learn the lyrics and understand them.</p>

<h2 id="artistry-in-rhythm-winard-harper-http-www-winardharper-com-drums">Artistry in rhythm: <a href="http://www.winardharper.com/">Winard Harper</a>, drums</h2>

<p>Winard Harper spoke of coming from a musical family and playing at clubs by the time he was five years old. He emphasized the importance of relationships in making music come together.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s really into an African instrument that I never heard of before called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balafon">&ldquo;balafon&rdquo;</a>. More generally, he is interested in all kinds of world music, whether from Africa, Australia, Japan. He urged everyone to honor tradition, learn history, and do a lot of playing and listening. &ldquo;The more you know, the more you can use&rdquo;. He summed up with the message that as a drummer, when jamming, you have to face all kinds of situations, drums that are not yours, etc., and you have to learn to deal, because it&rsquo;s not about you but about music. Sounds wise no matter what instrument we play!</p>

<h2 id="the-piano-in-jazz-george-cables-http-georgecables-com">The piano in jazz: <a href="http://georgecables.com/">George Cables</a></h2>

<p>George Cables emphasized that jazz is living music, through which everyone can become a &ldquo;co-composer&rdquo; through arranging and improvising.</p>

<p>As a pianist, he didn&rsquo;t want to be a soloist so much as a good side man. He was most inspired by Wynton Kelly.</p>

<p>Musically, he emphasized that the piano is a percussion instrument. He also gave a history lesson on the piano in jazz, starting from Scott Joplin and moving forward from there. He said the progression was toward &ldquo;freeing the bass&rdquo;, allowing the left hand to do a lot more.</p>

<p>(I had to leave this session a little early because I wanted to make it to a special recorder concert elsewhere in town.)</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>I found it very interesting and useful attending Pitt Jazz Seminar sessions these past two days, featuring very different musicians on different instruments, getting a broad perspective on how they operate and what they value and what they have to teach. I hope to continue attending this annual event!</p>
