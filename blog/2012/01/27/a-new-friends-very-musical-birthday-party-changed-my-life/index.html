    <h1>A new friend&#39;s very musical birthday party changed my life</h1>
    

<p>Tonight Abby and I went to a birthday party at the home of Henry, someone we both coincidentally know, but not very well, a professional musician who is <a href="http://henrydoktorski.com/">quite an accomplished accordionist</a>. The interesting thing is that I know him from having played two <a href="http://pittsburghcc.org/">Pittsburgh Chess Club</a> tournament games of chess with him seven years ago, back in February and March 2005, while Abby knows him from <a href="http://www.henrydoktorski.com/misc/Accordion_Pool_Party.html">his involvement</a> in the <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/local/neighborhoods-city/accordion-pool-partys-another-use-for-empty-lawrenceville-pool-357459/">Accordion Pool Party</a> in September of 2009.</p>

<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/16409797?badge=0" width="500" height="375" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/16409797">Accordion pool party</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/dhenuka">Dhenuka Ganesh</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p></p>

<p>Abby was invited to his birthday party as a fellow member of the Accordion Pool Party event (which she played in). She asked me whether I was interested in going. I said, sure! I was intrigued because Henry had created a program for his birthday party including a mini-concert he was going to give after dinner, followed by a &ldquo;jam session with musician friends&rdquo;.</p>

<p>So we went. <strong>And my life changed, forever.</strong></p>

<h2 id="bringing-instruments">Bringing instruments</h2>

<p>Abby brought her tambura to the party, while I brought my flute. I had no idea whether I was actually going to play anything, since I am still such a <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/01/08/finding-and-using-my-childhood-flute-books/">total, utter beginner</a>.</p>

<h3 id="update-of-2012-02-01">(Update of 2012-02-01)</h3>

<p>What I didn&rsquo;t say in my original blog post was that I had just <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/02/01/joining-an-orchestra-learning-in-the-face-of-terror/">tentatively joined a non-audition orchestra</a>, five days before Henry&rsquo;s birthday party, but was feeling very depressed about how bad I was and how I could barely play any of the music at all on my flute.</p>

<h2 id="at-the-party">At the party</h2>

<p>It was a pretty big party, with lots of family members, neighbors, friends, musicians, kids.</p>

<p>Some people were already playing music when we arrived. They were on accordion, violin, piano, flute, taking turns playing music they had brought (or knew in their heads). I felt very intimidated and silly, because I had not even brought any music to play. And I knew what a beginner I still was on flute, when I heard one young woman playing flute herself. So I observed, listened, and tried to absorb what was going on.</p>

<p>Henry joined in periodically, accompanying people while on the piano, doing a lot of on-the-spot sight reading of what people had brought over to play. It was fascinating to see the sight reading at work.</p>

<p>Abby and I met a lot of people and chatted with them. Eventually dinner was ready and we ate.</p>

<h2 id="chess">Chess</h2>

<p>Henry had a nice wooden chess set out, and it was perpetually occupied by some kids as well as adults. Henry told them that I was good, encouraging us to play together, so despite my having quit chess a year ago, I actually ended up playing two games!</p>

<h2 id="mini-recital">Mini-recital</h2>

<p>Henry gave his mini-recital, playing waltzes, tangos, and other music, with true verve and virtuosity. He also played duets with a pianist friend. I somehow got called into being a page turner for Henry for these duets. That was a fascinating experience, watching how he dealt with the sight-reading issues, ornamented, and did a whole lot of other things that enabled me to observe a musician&rsquo;s working mind in real-time action.</p>

<h2 id="jam-session">Jam session</h2>

<p>Henry kept on encouraging people to play something. Abby got called into playing some Balkan music on her tambura. Henry really enjoyed that. He seemed upset that I didn&rsquo;t want to play the flute I had brought; why had I brought it then? But I just didn&rsquo;t feel up to it at all.</p>

<h2 id="departure">Departure</h2>

<p>When everyone finally started to leave the party, I silently made a resolution to myself: this whole atmosphere of casual musical jamming and fun was something I wanted to get in on, so I promised myself that the next similar musical party I went to, <em>I would play</em>. I would be prepared with at least something I&rsquo;d worked on that I could try to play.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I am very excited that Abby and I have made some new friends coming to this birthday party and hope that we will have opportunities to see them again in the future. And the warm feeling I had all evening made me realize, this is what I want my life to be like: being among musicians, playing together.</p>

<p><strong>I am going to do whatever it takes in order to join this musical world.</strong></p>

<h3 id="update-of-2012-03-17">(Update of 2012-03-17)</h3>

<p>I played tin whistle and flute at the <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/03/17/st-patricks-day-party-playing-tin-whistle-and-flute/">next party of Henry&rsquo;s we went to</a>.</p>
