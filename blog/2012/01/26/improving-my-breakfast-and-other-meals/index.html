    <h1>Improving my breakfast and other meals: a paleo progress report</h1>
    

<p>In the past couple of months, I&rsquo;ve made some large changes in my diet. Fundamentally, I&rsquo;ve moved in a <a href="../../../../../categories/paleo/">paleo</a> direction. The largest change was breakfast, where I completely gave up my old breakfast and <a href="../../../../../blog/2011/11/03/one-of-these-breakfasts-is-not-paleo/">replaced it</a>. After some experimentation, I&rsquo;ve finally arrived at a breakfast template that seems optimal for me (as gauged by my morning energy level and other criteria I discuss below).</p>

<p>As an example, here is what I ate this morning:</p>

<p>The ingredients, and what has changed, and why:</p>

<h2 id="recipe">Recipe</h2>

<ul>
<li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tsp <a href="http://www.organicfacts.net/organic-oils/organic-coconut-oil/health-benefits-of-coconut-oil.html">coconut oil</a></li>
<li>2 <a href="../../../../../blog/2011/11/28/thankful-for-the-free-range-orange-yolked-eggs/">eggs</a>, fried</li>
<li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> clove of <a href="http://www.garlic-central.com/garlic-health.html">garlic</a></li>
<li>some shakes of seasoning mix (salt, pepper, etc.)</li>
<li>a dash of turmeric</li>
<li>some red pepper flakes</li>
<li>butternut squash</li>
<li>spinach</li>
<li>uncooked <a href="http://www.traderjoes.com/how-to/olive-oil.asp">extra virgin olive oil</a> on top of the veggies</li>
<li>about 7 walnuts</li>
<li>1 tsp <a href="http://lowcarbdiets.about.com/od/whattoeat/a/flaxinfo.htm">flax seeds</a>, sprinkled on top of everything at the end</li>
<li>1 prune on the side</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="changes-and-rationale">Changes and rationale</h2>

<h3 id="carbs">Carbs</h3>

<p>I stopped my short experiment of eating potatoes or rice with breakfast because I found that my morning energy level was simply better without those high-glycemic carbs. I think there is a legitimate place for such carbs, but not in my current schedule, which does not (yet) include intensive exercise before breakfast.</p>

<h3 id="additions">Additions</h3>

<p>I now always eat two eggs, instead of one. One wasn&rsquo;t really enough to make me feel satisfied.</p>

<p>I recently added coconut oil, which I had not been using because some past experiments did not work out well. I think that was because of using too much. So I&rsquo;m not using much now. Amusingly, my main use of coconut oil up till now has been to rub onto my skin during this dry winter season.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve added more spices such as turmeric and hot red pepper to my breakfast because I like them and because they seem to give me a little wake-up boost and stimulate alertness.</p>

<p>The flax seeds are new, as well as the prune. The prune is probably not &ldquo;paleo&rdquo;, according to someone or other, but as I&rsquo;ve mentioned before, I get confused by the different paleo schools of thought, and I don&rsquo;t follow any of them, but just use them as practical sources of ideas for self-experimentation. I have a very specific rationale for the use of flax seeds and prunes: I have to confess that I dealt with constipation issues when initially moving away from my big oatmeal breakfast to my paleo-style breakfast. I tried various solutions, but one that seems to have worked is the addition of flax seeds (which I typically only add for breakfast, but sometimes will also do for another meal too) and the prune. I have had no constipation issues since adding these to my breakfast.</p>

<h2 id="other-meals">Other meals</h2>

<p>I have been trying to kick my &ldquo;addiction&rdquo; to rice. I have gradually decreased my consumption of rice (white or brown). Almost imperceptibly, my craving for it has decreased continually. It&rsquo;s now been a couple of days since I have been doing without rice for lunch, but I am still eating it for dinner.</p>

<p>I still love pizza, and have not yet eliminated it. It&rsquo;s very hard to avoid both convenience and temptation when it&rsquo;s provided at talks and meetings. However, on days when I plan to eat pizza, I have tried to get my metabolism up before eating it. That seems to help. I&rsquo;ll still keep in my mind the idea of giving up pizza.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>My experimentation with diet have continued over the months, and will continue.</p>

<p>I hope my report may be of use to you if you are considering changing up your breakfast patterns away from the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; American sugary breakfasts.</p>

<p>What do you eat for breakfast that works for you? What do you similarly or differently from me?</p>
