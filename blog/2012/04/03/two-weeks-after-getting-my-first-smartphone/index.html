    <h1>Two weeks after getting my first smartphone</h1>
    

<p>I got my first smartphone in my life <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/03/22/paradox-i-will-observe-the-national-day-of-unplugging-but-just-bought-my-first-smartphone-this-week/">just two weeks ago</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S_II">Samsung Galaxy S II</a>. I&rsquo;ve been too busy to actually sit down and read the <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/product/SGH-T989ZKBTMB">279-page manual</a>, but here are some observations on how I&rsquo;ve used the smartphone so far.</p>

<h2 id="i-am-already-plugged-in-through-other-devices">I am already plugged in through other devices</h2>

<p>First of all, in my everyday life I tend to be near a computer and don&rsquo;t use my smartphone:</p>

<ul>
<li>At work, I use my work computer.</li>
<li>When I go to scheduled talks or meetings, I bring my laptop or iPad, so that I can take notes and look stuff up.</li>
<li>At home, I have my laptop and iPad.</li>
</ul>

<p>My preference is for the larger display and keyboard when possible.</p>

<h2 id="wifi-in-public-places">WiFi in public places</h2>

<p>I have found myself looking for WiFi in public places in order to check email and the like when otherwise idle (I try to avoid needlessly using my data plan). I suppose that in the past, I would have just sat around waiting, or just left instead of spending more time somewhere unnecessarily. Some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>At the public library, my usual pattern is to just return stuff, check stuff out, and leave. I have caught myself hanging around just to check my email before leaving. Arguably there is no point in this behavior.</li>
<li>While Abby and I were looking for stuff in a store, I quickly got bored of waiting for her and found it actually productive to connect to free WiFi and read email and blog and Twitter feeds; in the past, I would have just sat down somewhere and closed my eyes or something.</li>
<li>During the long intermission at a concert I went to alone, not knowing anyone there, I spent time online rather than just sitting around. (Arguably I could have spent some time socializing with strangers, but I have tended not to do that.)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="other-uses-in-public-in-the-past-two-weeks">Other uses in public in the past two weeks</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s handy having a decent camera on me at all times. I have used it in a couple of situations in which in the past I would have had to consciously bring a bulky camera along (which I don&rsquo;t like to do):</p>

<ul>
<li>Taking a photo after a concert.</li>
<li>Taking a photo of some notes written on a board.</li>
<li>Taking a photo of a flyer posted up.</li>
<li>Taking a photo of two dogs at play at the office.</li>
<li>Capturing some video during a dance party.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a-failed-experiment-at-the-gym">A failed experiment at the gym</h2>

<p>I am not one who has ever plugged into an iPod while exercising. However, I did an experiment today, hoping to watch a lecture video while at the gym. This failed miserably. Any vigorous movement (on a rowing machine, on a treadmill) resulted in my fear that the phone would fall, and definitely the headset with wires was very clumsy: the wires flapping around, and the short length of the wires.</p>

<p>I suppose using a Bluetooth headset would fix a couple of these problems.</p>

<p>But the real problem is that I supposedly watched the whole lecture, but I don&rsquo;t actually remember much of it!! Multitasking in certain contexts doesn&rsquo;t work for me. The thing is that yesterday I was watching lecture videos while at home, and that worked, but the situation was very different: I was doing strength training, I was using a large display on my computer, and I was alone, with no distracting noises or other people around.</p>

<h2 id="on-the-road">On the road</h2>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t used the phone out on the road for navigation or the like yet. The next time we do some travel, we&rsquo;ll see how useful the phone becomes.</p>

<h2 id="i-was-that-annoying-person-briefly">I was that <em>annoying person</em> (briefly)</h2>

<p>Finally, I caught myself being the annoying person distracted in public walking down the street while fumbling with my phone and almost walking into someone. I did that twice, last week. I will not do that again. There was no reason whatsoever for me to be even plugged in during those moments. And if there are reasons, I could easily stop walking and stand somewhere out of the way to do my business.</p>

<p>The good news is that at the two parties I&rsquo;ve been to in the past two weeks, I was not the annoying person who pulled out a phone to do stuff. I will admit that during a bathroom break or two I did pull out the phone, but at least that was very brief and in private. In principle, I should avoid feeling bored at parties: the whole point of them, after all, is to bring people together, and so I should be engaging with people who are at the party, rather than looking at my Twitter feed or something.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Not a whole lot has changed since I got my first smartphone, in part because I haven&rsquo;t learned all the features yet or gotten serious about apps for the phone. I&rsquo;ll continue being aware of how I use it and report on anything interesting that happens.</p>
