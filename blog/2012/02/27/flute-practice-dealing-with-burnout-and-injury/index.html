<p>Yesterday, I attended yet another <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/02/22/flute-progress-still-hanging-in-there/">rehearsal</a> of the <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/auo/">Carnegie Mellon All-University Orchestra</a>.</p>

<p>I did this while feeling burned out and injured.</p>

<h2 id="burnout-and-injury">Burnout and injury</h2>

<p>In the past couple of days, I have experienced decreased desire to practice flute, although by changing up my material, I did manage to get some decent sessions in. Still, I could tell that I was beginning to risk burnout.</p>

<p>In addition to mental fatigue, my <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/02/14/flute-progress-report-day-of-reckoning-approaches/">left forefinger soreness</a> got worse in the past couple of days, such that yesterday, I didn&rsquo;t practice before rehearsal. I started experiencing <a href="http://www.jennifercluff.com/lineup.htm#indentation">tingling and numbness</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://theskooloflife.com/wordpress/sometimes-its-best-to-call-it-a-day/">Sometimes it&rsquo;s best to call it a day.</a> So I decided yesterday that today, I would take a day completely off from practicing my flute, the first break I have given myself since January 19.</p>

<h3 id="injury">Injury</h3>

<p>Clearly I need a real strategy to take care of the side of my left finger.</p>

<p>It is pretty easy to get injured playing music. There are many unnatural positions and movements to work with to make as relaxed as possible. My favorite book for musicians, <a href="http://musiciansway.com/">&ldquo;The Musician&rsquo;s Way&rdquo;</a> has two entire chapters on injury prevention.</p>

<p>The next time I pick up my flute, I will focus on what I might be doing that causes particular stress on my left finger, and try to adjust. Earlier in my practice, I had problems with my right pinkie finger and solved them, so I have hope of treating my left finger better also. I have read about balance points, using the chin, etc.</p>

<h2 id="my-instrument">My instrument</h2>

<p>One problem that I definitely have is that the instrument I have is not optimal for me, and I know it. My main fundamental problem (and this has been a problem for me with piano, guitar, ukulele) is that I have a small hand and short fingers. There are solutions to this problem for the flute. One very common option that would immediately solve some of my problems is the <a href="http://www.flutesonline.com/in_offg.htm">offset G</a>.</p>

    <figcaption>
        <h4>Offset G flute</h4>

</figure>


<p>I&rsquo;ve always thought that I would like to get an offset G flute when I &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; from my intermediate student flute. <strong>Now I&rsquo;m thinking I should do this sooner rather than later.</strong></p>

<h3 id="no-excuse">No excuse</h3>

<p>Another book on music practice that I enjoy, Madeline Bruser&rsquo;s <a href="http://artofpracticing.com/">&ldquo;The Art of Practicing&rdquo;</a>, has an anecdote (page 107) about a flutist, Janet Weiss, who found that the traditional flute did not fit her hand, and became a pioneer in redesigning it. Weiss was quoted as saying, &ldquo;The instrument we&rsquo;re playing is incorrect for many people&hellip; it&rsquo;s like trying to dance in a pair of shoes that don&rsquo;t fit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indeed! If we love music enough, we should take the initiative to make sure that we are not hampered by our instruments. Just as, I love running and hiking, and struggled with bad footwear for years, decades, until I solved most of my problems, by moving toward <a href="../../../../../categories/fivefingers/">Vibram FiveFingers</a> shoes that do not cramp my very wide feet and do not introduce cushioning that causes me to mess up my knees and shins and ankles.</p>

<p>We have to do what we have to do. We can&rsquo;t just complain that other people are lucky and mass-produced clothing and tools work for them.</p>

<h2 id="the-orchestra-rehearsal-last-night">The orchestra rehearsal last night</h2>

<p>I was still struggling at rehearsal last night. I still cannot play all of the music at full speed. If it were entirely up to me, I would improve at my own pace, rather than feel forced to tackle material that is currently more beyond me than I&rsquo;d like. But in real life, we often have to cut corners. The question is, which corners?</p>

<p>One option is to just bumble through everything in an equally mediocre way. I don&rsquo;t see how that would help the orchestra&rsquo;s concert performance or my own long-term development. So I have chosen to refine what is easiest, and get that working fully, while &ldquo;giving up&rdquo;, at least temporarily, on what is most out of reach. I&rsquo;ve been closing the gap, and believe that I can close it within another three weeks. That would mean I will feel fully ready probably two weeks before the actual concert.</p>

<p>Everyone else is also still improving. We don&rsquo;t sound very good right now, even at slowish speeds. But we are sounding better every week! That&rsquo;s what matters. It&rsquo;s exciting to feel us coming together more and more.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m dealing with a temporary setback in motivation and physical condition right now, but hope to bounce back tomorrow. <strong>The show must go on.</strong></p>
