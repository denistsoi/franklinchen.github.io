    <h1>Yet another haircut from Joe: always worth the wait</h1>
    

<p>So today I got another haircut from Joe Feldman, at Harry&rsquo;s Barber Shoppe in Squirrel Hill. Almost exactly a year ago, <a href="../../../../../blog/2011/10/29/my-favorite-barber/">I fondly described my visit to Joe&rsquo;s</a>. Today, I still make the time to get my haircuts from him, after <strong>fifteen years</strong> now of having my hair cut only by him (other than one occasion when he was closed because of breaking his hand), on average of once every two months.</p>

<p>Today was probably my longest wait ever, <em>over two hours</em>! But it was worth it.</p>

<h2 id="the-wait">The wait</h2>

<p>Late in the afternoon, I had called from work to verify that he was open, and he had said that nobody was in line, so I rushed to leave work early to take advantage of the opportunity for a shorter wait, but by the time I arrived, there were already <em>six</em> people ahead of me in line, one in the chair. Since I knew from experience that he takes about twenty minutes per person, I knew I was in for a two-hour wait, and I was right.</p>

<p>And guys kept on coming in who clearly were going to have to wait for up to three hours. Wow.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-spent-the-time">How I spent the time</h2>

<h3 id="smartphone">Smartphone</h3>

<p>I tend to get my haircut from Joe on Friday if possible, to end the work week relaxing. Since <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/03/22/paradox-i-will-observe-the-national-day-of-unplugging-but-just-bought-my-first-smartphone-this-week/">I have had a smartphone now for seven months</a>, many occasions that used to involve my idly &ldquo;waiting&rdquo; are now opportunities to be productive. I caught up on reading and writing a lot of email (yes, it has actually become feasible to do this since I bought <a href="http://www.swiftkey.net/">SwiftKey</a>), as well as reading archived Web links that I had saved up.</p>

<h3 id="nap">Nap</h3>

<p>Then I took a nap. It&rsquo;s been a long week, and it&rsquo;s going to be a long weekend!</p>

<h3 id="music">Music</h3>

<p>After I was done napping, I kind of sat back and listened to the oldies music that Joe always has on. It&rsquo;s an interesting game trying to identify who is singing, because all the music is &ldquo;before my time&rdquo; (as Joe pointed out even to another guy sitting near me who was older than me, who was also playing this game). That said, I can and did easily identify Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Elvis, and various others from their voices and styles. I did not identify Englebert Humperdinck; I still don&rsquo;t really know who he is, and have never actively listened to his music (unlike the vocalists I just mentioned).</p>

<p>Amusingly, there was one song in which I didn&rsquo;t actually immediately identify the singer, but a guy gave a hint, and then I easily got the answer: <a href="http://olivianewton-john.com/">Olivia Newton-John</a>. For once, someone who is not as far removed from &ldquo;my time&rdquo;! I saw her as a kid when my friend Lisa in elementary school in second/third grades invited me to go with her to see the premiere of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grease_(film)">Grease</a> (her mother took us to see it). It was way too grown-up a movie for me to get at the time, but the tunes were catchy (and for quite some time all my classmates were singing them at school). So I actually have some nostalgia for Olivia Newton-John&rsquo;s singing.</p>

<h3 id="politics">Politics</h3>

<p>I generally stay out of political discussions, especially during election times such as these. But two guys were expressing various opinions. I kept my mouth shut.</p>

<h3 id="place-in-line">Place in line</h3>

<p>One of the guys said he needed to go out for five minutes and would come back. There was a very brief and slight scene in which Joe warned him that if somebody came in the meantime, he would lose his place, because there are no reservations and that&rsquo;s the rule. After the guy colorfully called Joe a &ldquo;gangster&rdquo;, Joe explained how being too lenient in the past had led to bad situations in which people came and went and wanted their place back, etc. I can totally imagine that. Rules are rules. Joe has his rules, and I respect them, and they work, however anachronistic and demanding they might be in this fast-paced, multitasking age.</p>

<p>In fact, I had actually lost my &ldquo;original&rdquo; place in line today, because I had showed up expecting no line, when I saw five in line. So I had gone back home (just a block away) to get a snack to bring to eat, and a book to maybe read, and when I got back, a guy walked in the door a split second before I did, so I became seventh in line rather than sixth.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I treasure my visits to Joe once every two months. I get not only a <em>terrific</em> haircut, but also enjoy the periodic trip down memory lane through the oldies radio station and the chance to enjoy the <em>slowness</em> of life that the space encourages and even enforces.</p>

<h2 id="bonus-videos">Bonus videos</h2>

<p>In honor of Olivia Newton-John, here&rsquo;s a 1978 live performance by her of &ldquo;Hopelessly Devoted to You&rdquo;. Laugh if you want, but I <em>love</em> this song, and I love her performance above all other singers&rsquo; covers, even to this day!</p>

<p>But here&rsquo;s some random guy on YouTube who sings it really quite beautifully while playing the guitar:</p>
