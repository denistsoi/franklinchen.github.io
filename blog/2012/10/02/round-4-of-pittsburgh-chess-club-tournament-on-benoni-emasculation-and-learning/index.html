<p>Tonight was the fifth (and penultimate) round of the current six-round Tuesday night tournament at the <a href="http://pittsburghcc.org/">Pittsburgh Chess Club</a>, the 14th Fred Sorensen Memorial. I last reported on the <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/09/19/round-3-of-pittsburgh-chess-club-tournament-another-approach-against-the-sicilian-squeezing-with-the-bind/">third round</a>, rather than the fourth round, because as I <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/08/29/returning-to-chess/">mentioned in August upon signing up for the tournament</a>, I took a bye for the fourth round because of a schedule conflict with a <a href="http://www.pghtech.org/networks/PittJug/events.aspx">Pittsburgh Java User Group</a> meeting that I wanted to attend.</p>

<p>Thankfully, I came back for the fifth round finding that I was still tied for first, despite taking a half point bye in the fourth round, because nobody else had a perfect score after four rounds either.</p>

<p>The game tonight ended up one-sided; right after he resigned, he called it an &ldquo;emasculation&rdquo; (I won fairly quickly, in less than two hours). However:</p>

<ul>
<li>the unfolding of the game provides what I think is a nice illustration of how to win thematically against a Benoni opening structure</li>
<li>my opponent and I had a good discussion, after the game, about learning and improvement</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-complete-annotated-game">The complete annotated game</h2>

<p>At your convenience, you can <a href="../../../../../chess/mirra-chen-2012-10-02.htm">enjoy playing over the game with my annotations, including diagrams.</a></p>

<h2 id="the-paradox-of-choice-how-to-play-against-the-english-opening-as-black">The paradox of choice: how to play against the English Opening as Black?</h2>

<p>I learned some days before tonight&rsquo;s game that my opponent and I were going to be paired. Based on my memory, and my database of games, I expected my opponent to play the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Opening">English Opening</a>. In our last game, in 2010, he had played the English. I planned to avoid the variation that I had played then, because of course he would be prepared for it.</p>

<h3 id="reverse-sicilian">Reverse Sicilian?</h3>

<p>I have a confession to make: in the past, I hated facing the English Opening as Black. It&rsquo;s the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice:_Why_More_Is_Less">paradox of choice</a>: there are so many different ways to play against it. It is not a forcing, direct opening the way <code>1 e4</code> and <code>1 d4</code> are. In its purest form, in fact, it is a psychological trick, an attempt to play a <a href="../../../../../categories/sicilian-defense/">Sicilian Defense</a> in reverse, but with an extra move, if Black takes up the challenge of playing <code>1... e5</code>. That extra move makes a huge difference, both objectively and psychologically, in the kinds of positions and evaluations that can arise, as noted English Opening theoretician <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Chess-Openings-John-Watson/dp/1904600980">John Watson</a> has brilliantly explained. Roughly, it&rsquo;s like playing the Sicilian Defense but getting an extra punch in before the fight starts.</p>

<p>In my 2010 game against my opponent, I in fact took up the challenge as Black and went into an aggressive reversed Sicilian variation, one tempo down: I played the Rubinstein Variation, which is exactly the <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/09/19/round-3-of-pittsburgh-chess-club-tournament-another-approach-against-the-sicilian-squeezing-with-the-bind/">Maróczy Bind</a> in reverse. This is very risky, and although I won that game, I have also lost playing it. I do not play that kind of reversed Sicilian any more.</p>

<h3 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h3>

<p>There are many, many alternatives to playing for a reverse Sicilian as Black. Tonight I chose to aim to fight for the <code>d5</code> square, to play to occupy the center and Queen side.</p>

<h2 id="overview-of-my-game">Overview of my game</h2>

<h3 id="the-opening">The opening</h3>

<p>As expected, my opponent played <code>1 c4</code>, the English Opening. After some more moves, it turned out that my opponent allowed me to play a reversed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoni_Defense">Benoni</a>.</p>

<p>Again, there are dangers in playing reversed openings, in which Black takes the aggressive role White ordinarily takes but with a tempo down, but in this case, because of a positional subtlety, I was allowed to play a good version of the reversed Benoni as Black:</p>

    <figcaption>
        <h4>A good reversed Benoni for Black</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>The problem for White is that he used his extra moves to play <code>b3</code> and <code>Bb2</code>, but now the Bishop is blocked up and is misplaced. This is an example of what proponents of the Black pieces such as John Watson and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A1s_Adorj%C3%A1n">András Adorján</a> have observed about the subtleties of having extra moves: sometimes they are committal and do not help the side which has them!</p>

<h4 id="concepts-of-the-benoni">Concepts of the Benoni</h4>

<p>For those who are not very familiar with the Benoni as a chess opening, here is an overview of the goals of the two sides, which I&rsquo;ll call the <em>attacker</em> and the <em>counter-attacker</em> (in the regular Benoni, these are White and Black, respectively, and in the reversed Benoni, these are Black and White, respectively).</p>

<p>Note that I don&rsquo;t mention a role <em>defender</em> here, because this opening is so sharp and aggressive for both sides that really, both sides are simultaneously attacking and defending for their lives. This opening is not for the faint-hearted for either side! It is a &ldquo;kill or be killed&rdquo; type of opening. I have played the Benoni on both sides, and both killed and been killed. (Most recently, I <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/05/31/some-pretty-attacking-chess-at-a-party-last-weekend/">played the counter-attacking role against a boy in a casual game</a> and broke through quickly.)</p>

<p>The <em>attacker</em> has more space, has a center pawn wedge thrust into the innards of the counter-attacker&rsquo;s position, and aims to squeeze the counter-attacker to death, preventing Queen side counterplay, while preparing to blast through at the tip of the pawn wedge.</p>

<p>The <em>counter-attacker</em> has less space, and hopes to launch a flank attack on the back end of the attacker&rsquo;s pawn wedge and destroy the attacker&rsquo;s center, coming around the attacker&rsquo;s weakened Queen side to swarm in that way.</p>

<h3 id="the-middle">The middle</h3>

<p>The game tonight had the counter-attacker never getting Queen side counterplay off the ground, while the attacker (Black) broke through without resistance in the center: note that Black has played <code>e4</code> successfully and White&rsquo;s thematic <code>b4</code> is nowhere near possible.</p>

<h3 id="the-end">The end</h3>

<p>There was no real end game to speak of, since by the time Queens came off the board, the game was lost for White.</p>

<h2 id="discussion-with-my-opponent">Discussion with my opponent</h2>

<p>After the game, my opponent and I discussed the errors that he made during the game: I considered that allowing the reverse Benoni after <code>b3</code> and <code>Bb2</code> was an error, and then after that, failing to prevent e4 with Nd2 was an error.</p>

<h3 id="study">Study</h3>

<p>He noted that he had prepared for our game by studying our game in 2010 and had improved his understanding of the opening variation we had played then, but I told him that I, too, had looked at the game, and never planned to walk into his preparation. He said that he had every confidence that if I had played the same opening variation, I would have done my homework also, to improve what I did last time. He said he respected that even against a weaker player such as himself, he trusted that I would not play an opening I considered inferior or unsound <em>just because I could get away it</em>. I really appreciated this comment and statement of trust, because in fact this is my current serious attitude. In a blitz game, I might play around, but in a serious tournament game, I will no longer play &ldquo;junk&rdquo;. <em>This was not always the case</em>. In fact, in one of our earliest games, years ago, I had played junk against him and won, but not felt happy about doing that.</p>

<h3 id="learning">Learning</h3>

<p>I congratulated him for doing his homework, and having improved so much in the past couple of years, and he said he learns from his mistakes. Bravo! I have no doubt that he will study the opening we played today and be ready in the future not just for me, but anyone who plays how I did today. Some people make the mistake, during these Tuesday night tournaments in which we face the same people repeatedly, of preparing one-shot ideas against specific opponents, but what we really want to do (and what he does and what I do) is use these rematches as excuses to improve our <em>general</em> knowledge and skill.</p>

<p>My opponent said, before we parted tonight, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t learn from my wins. I learn from my losses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I would amend that remark, however. I try to learn from my wins as well. Just because I won this game doesn&rsquo;t mean I haven&rsquo;t gone and analyzed <em>where I could have won even faster</em> or <em>possible good moves he could have made that I overlooked</em>. Every game that I play, whether I win or lose, I want to learn something from. I have won games in which I played horribly and didn&rsquo;t see anything and only won because my opponent saw less. I&rsquo;m not satisfied with just <em>seeing more than someone else</em>; I actually want <em>to see the naked truth</em>.</p>

<h2 id="what-next">What next?</h2>

<p>Next Tuesday is the last round of the six-round tournament. I am now the undisputed leader for first, meaning that if I draw next week, I am guaranteed at least a tie for first prize; if I win, I get clear first prize.</p>

<p><em>None of that really matters to me</em>. I&rsquo;m in this to play as well as I can, enjoy the art, enjoy the sport, and to write up everything I learn along the way, whether I win, draw, or lose. I am, of course, grateful that I have been winning.</p>

<h3 id="update-of-2012-10-07">(Update of 2012-10-07)</h3>

<p>Oops, it turns out that I was wrong in figuring that I was the undisputed leader for first going into the final round: in fact, someone took a bye in the fifth round after a perfect score in the first four rounds, so he and I are tied for first going into the final round, and in fact, we are playing each other on Tuesday. So if I draw, that only guarantees that we split first prize. I need to win in order to get clear first prize.</p>

<p>I am, of course, playing for a win. For better or for worse, <strong>I have never played for a draw in my life, against anyone, even a Grandmaster.</strong></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Tonight I got a chance to play an opening, reverse Benoni, that I haven&rsquo;t played for some time in a tournament, and I won the game through clear, thematic moves. In addition, we had a pleasant discussion after the game, and I look forward to seeing him play better in this opening in the future, and I too will refine my play in it.</p>
