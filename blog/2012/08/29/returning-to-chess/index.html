<p>(A chess tournament in 2006.)</p>

<p>So tonight I stopped by the <a href="http://pittsburghcc.org/">Pittsburgh Chess Club</a> to renew my expired membership and pre-register for the next 6-round Tuesday night tournament, the Fred Sorensen Memorial, which starts on Tuesday after Labor Day. This will be the sixth time I&rsquo;m playing in this annual tournament.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been almost two years since I played tournament chess.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a look back at previous years of the tournament and reflections on why I&rsquo;ve played off and on, and what makes this &ldquo;comeback&rdquo; different from all the rest.</p>

<h2 id="fred-sorensen-memorial-tournament-in-the-fall">Fred Sorensen Memorial tournament in the fall</h2>

<p>I first played in this tournament in <a href="http://main.uschess.org/assets/msa_joomla/XtblMain.php?200510184561-12226800">2005</a>, as part of my first year back to tournament chess in two decades. I was still trying to regain my skill, and did not play so well. I lost one game, and took second place with a score of 5.0/6.0 points.</p>

<p>By <a href="http://main.uschess.org/assets/msa_joomla/XtblMain.php?200610176361-12226800">2006</a>, I was rapidly improving my chess, in the process of making some really radical changes to my knowledge and playing style (given that when I played as a kid, I was basically self-taught and never studied chess in any systematic, thorough way). I won with a perfect score of 6.0/6.0 points.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://main.uschess.org/assets/msa_joomla/XtblMain.php?200710163361-12226800">2007</a>, I was still improving, and won with a score of 5.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub>.0 points.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://main.uschess.org/assets/msa_joomla/XtblMain.php?200810145131-12226800">2008</a>, I had gone several months already playing worse than I had in 2006 and 2007, and I tied for first with a score of 5.0/5.0 points. What happened was that I had first met Abby in late 2006, and started dating in mid-2007. I was not putting any energy into improving or even maintaining my competitive chess sharpness. In retrospect, I should have made some tough decisions about priorities and stopped playing tournament chess by the beginning of 2008. In fact, after playing a couple more months, I quit chess entirely for almost two years: Abby and I got married in 2009.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://main.uschess.org/assets/msa_joomla/XtblMain.php?201010121031-12226800">2010</a>, I attempted to make a comeback to chess, but I was not playing well; I was physically and mentally exhausted from other concerns in my life the entire time, even falling asleep during some of my games. I still managed to tie for first with a score of 5.0/5.0 points, but lost rating points doing so. After a couple of months, I quit chess again for almost two years. There was just no room for chess as long as I was focused on completely new priorities including marriage, home, and my 2011 return to music after decades away from it.</p>

<h2 id="why-am-i-coming-back-to-chess-yet-again-now-in-2012">Why am I coming back to chess yet again now, in 2012?</h2>

<p>This year, I&rsquo;ve slowly returned to playing a little bit of chess casually, analyzing games, and even <a href="../../../../../categories/chess/">writing a bit about chess</a>. And I&rsquo;m kind of hungering for competition again.</p>

<p>But this time, I have a different attitude and goal than in the past. In the past, when I was in &ldquo;chess mode&rdquo;, I was obsessed with things like winning, achievement, improving my rating, maybe attaining an official <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_master">National Master title</a> (which had slipped past my fingers in 2007: if I had dropped out of one of my tournaments in progress, I would have acquired enough wins to receive the title, but out of sheer pride, I wanted to finish the tournament and ended up on a losing streak).</p>

<h3 id="my-goals">My goals</h3>

<p>Now, my goal is to play well while having fun. I am explicitly not setting a goal of winning games or winning tournaments. I trust that if I play well, I will get whatever I deserve.</p>

<p>In fact, tonight I did something I have never done in my life as a tournament player: I have taken a bye for one of the rounds in the tournament, because of a schedule conflict. Taking the bye means receiving half a point for not playing, and that means decreasing my chances of winning the tournament. Someone not taking a bye could win six games in a row, while my taking a bye means that my maximum possible score if I won five games would be good for at best second place. By taking a bye, I am choosing not to make winning this tournament my highest priority.</p>

<p>In the fourth scheduled round (of six), there is a presentation at the meeting of the <a href="http://www.pghtech.org/networks/PittJug/events.aspx">Pittsburgh Java Users Group (PittJUG)</a> that I want to attend. In past years, when I was playing Tuesday night chess tournaments most Tuesday, I would miss meetings of PittJUG or other groups that met on Tuesdays. At this point in my life, improving my knowledge as a software developer is more important than winning a chess tournament.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I am returning to tournament chess with a different mindset than I had in previous years. This time, I want to maximize my enjoyment rather than my achievement. We&rsquo;ll see how this goes. For the record, it seems that I actually always did the best anyway when my goal was enjoyment and I felt relaxed. It was when I put a lot of pressure on myself, as I got better and better, that I repeatedly choked.</p>

<h4 id="update-of-2015-12-21">(Update of 2015-12-21)</h4>

<p>So much for &ldquo;enjoyment&rdquo;: three years later, I made a focused push,
temporarily putting many things aside in my life, in the fall of 2015
to <a href="../../../../../blog/2016/01/22/on-finally-achieving-the-us-national-master-chess-title-at-age-45-part-1">achieve my US Chess National Master</a> title, and finally made it, a
dream come true.</p>

<p>I found an outlet for the enjoyment part of chess, however: teaching
private lessons since 2013.</p>
