<p>Today was a very special day.</p>

<p>It was the wedding day of one of my best friends, Steve, whom I first met in Pittsburgh over a decade ago. Abby and I were thrilled to have been able to travel to be there for Steve and to meet and get to know Kelly.</p>

<p>It suddenly started raining very hard at the outdoor wedding, which caused a lot of improvised changes in plans, but the rain cleared up eventually and everything went well: the details do not matter when we&rsquo;re talking about love and friendship and family. It was a lovely ceremony; the couple customized their own vows, which were funny as well as deeply serious and moving.</p>

<h2 id="planning-for-my-small-musical-role">Planning for my small musical role</h2>

<p>I had a small role to play. When Steve had told me about the wedding, I had immediately asked him if he would like me to play some music for him (since all the weddings I&rsquo;ve been to have involved a DJ or some friend handling iTunes off a laptop at some point). Eventually, after more important details were planned out, such as a string quartet hired to play before the wedding and during the ceremony, it was decided that I could play for maybe ten minutes after dinner at the reception in order to transition to the toasts.</p>

<p>I decided to bring my plastic <a href="../../../../../categories/baroque-flute/">Baroque flute</a> as being the best instrument to withstand easy travel to New Mexico.</p>

<p>So I memorized some of the traditional music I&rsquo;ve played before on Baroque flute, taking selections from an <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/04/21/my-first-time-in-a-public-music-jam-intense-fun-with-chris-norman-and-david-greenberg/">Irish/Scottish/Acadian set of scores</a> as well the <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/05/14/playing-french-music-for-first-time-and-dancing-blues-for-first-time/">French traditional dance music I got from Gregory</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-the-music-situation-turned-out">How the music situation turned out</h2>

<p>First of all, because of the rain, the string quartet had to stay inside, so there was no music for the ceremony itself, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Second, because of the rain, the sound system driven in by the bride&rsquo;s brother got wet and was inoperable, so there was not going to be an iTunes-based background music during the dinner reception.</p>

<p>So ironically, my little music performance after dinner turned out to have some more prominence than I expected, simply because of the rain. I played a selection of songs, solo, including spontaneous ornamentation during the repeats, of course. I did not play entirely without stumbling, but was pretty inspired because Steve&rsquo;s niece, about two years old, ended up turning around on her chair, standing up to face me, and smiling and dancing to the music!</p>

<p>I was touched that a number of people came up to me later and said they enjoyed the performance. Somehow, in a single moment, I remembered why I have chosen the musical path I deliberately put myself on <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/03/12/quitting-the-cmu-all-university-orchestra-one-of-the-hardest-decisions-in-my-life/">earlier this year</a>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I felt very honored to be able to attend my friend Steve&rsquo;s wedding and to provide a bit of musical entertainment for the guests at the reception. And to see his niece all excited and dancing while I played basically made my year.</p>
