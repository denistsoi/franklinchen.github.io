<p>Today, many of us geeks celebrate <a href="http://piday.org/">Pi Day</a>, because <em>π = 3.1415926535897932384626433&hellip;</em> is such an important number in math and science. I have to confess that I have never celebrated Pi Day, but it was just last year that I found out there was a movement <em>against</em> celebrating Pi Day, and advocating the celebration of <a href="http://tauday.com/">Tau Day</a> instead, where the special constant (which a community has chosen to be denoted by the Greek letter &ldquo;tau&rdquo;, <em>τ</em>) is <em>2π</em>, which is <em>6.283&hellip;</em>. Upon examining the evidence briefly, I had immediately agreed that indeed, we should not be celebrating Pi Day, and that therefore, today is simply <a href="http://halftauday.com/">Half-Tau Day</a>.</p>

<p>If this is getting <strong>much</strong> too geeky for you, feel free to ignore the rest of this blog post. Otherwise, bear with me!</p>

<h2 id="my-dark-days-with-π">My dark days with <em>π</em></h2>

<p>I suffered through the use of <em>π</em> throughout high school, when we learned trigonometry and all the cosines and sines involved radians from 0 to <em>2π</em>. Why is a complete revolution around the circle 2 times a constant, rather than being its own constant? And then there was calculus, same story.</p>

<p>I even got sucked into true geekery, memorizing nearly 50 digits of <em>π</em> in the summer after I graduated from high school. I still remember what happened: I was in a van traveling from Frankfurt to Jena, East Germany (this was 1987 before the fall of the Berlin Wall) as a member of the US team for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Physics_Olympiad">International Physics Olympiad</a> when I got really bored, and fellow teammate <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/bryan-beatty/13/497/581">Bryan Beatty</a> wrote out in pencil by memory the first 50 digits of <em>π</em> into the front cover of a book I had on me, and I proceeded to memorize those digits (no, I did not remember them forever).</p>

<p>Doing math and physics homework in college, I got burned repeatedly by the extra work of carrying around factors of 2 and canceling them out when doing arithmetic, because of the incorrect definition of the &ldquo;circle constant&rdquo; as <em>π</em>.</p>

<h3 id="update-of-2013-08-06">(Update of 2013-08-06)</h3>

<p>While doing some cleaning, I happened to find in my office the very book that I had on me during the trip and that Bryan wrote into (not the inside front cover, but the inside back cover)!</p>

<h3 id="update-of-2013-08-22">(Update of 2013-08-22)</h3>

<p>I found out that the physicist Hugh Young, the author of the book I have that Bryan wrote <em>π</em> into, <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2013/august/aug22_hughyoungobit.html">just died</a>. RIP.</p>

<h2 id="the-mystery-of-2π">The mystery of <em>2π</em></h2>

<p><em>2π</em> keeps on popping up in places other than in high school trigonometry and calculus. As Michael Hartl points out in his excellent <a href="http://tauday.com/tau-manifesto">Tau Manifesto</a>, anyone who has used the Gaussian (&ldquo;bell curve&rdquo;) distribution, through work in probability, statistics, machine learning, etc., sees the square root of <em>2π</em> all the time, and engineers and physicists see <em>2π</em> all the time when doing the Fourier transform. Eventually we just learn to immediately think that <em>π</em> is just half of something. For example, if you&rsquo;re doing an integral only on half the <em>x</em>-axis, you remember to use <em>π</em>. This is stupid, carrying around that extra 2 everywhere.</p>

<p><strong>Conceptually</strong>, the fundamental constant is clearly <em>2π</em>, not <em>π</em>. That is the argument we <strong>τ</strong>-believers accept: our concepts should be mapped to our notation. I strongly recommend that disbelievers watch Hartl&rsquo;s hilarious talk on <em>τ</em>:</p>

<h2 id="the-importance-of-good-notation-for-concepts-and-some-more-examples">The importance of good notation for concepts, and some more examples</h2>

<p><a href="http://terrytao.wordpress.com/advice-on-writing-papers/use-good-notation/">Good notation</a> is actually important in communicating ideas, expressing them, thinking them. Good notation reduces mental clutter and pointless work.</p>

<p>In physics, there is the concept of frequency. It turns out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_frequency">angular frequency</a> is more convenient to use, hence instead of writing the frequency <em>f</em>, we prefer to work with &ldquo;omega&rdquo;, which is <em>ω = 2πf</em>.</p>

<p>As a related example of the usefulness of choosing a proper numerical constant, consider the original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant">Planck&rsquo;s constant</a> <em>h</em>. Physicists quickly realized that it was much more convenient to use the reduced constant <em>ħ</em>, which is just <em>h</em> divided by <em>2π</em>. When writing equations in quantum mechanics, nobody uses <em>h</em>. We use <em>ħ</em> (pronounced &ldquo;h bar&rdquo;). The annoying factor of <em>2π</em> is removed from the picture. In fact, in my former life as a physics student, most of the work we did involved using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_units">natural units</a>, in which equations and calculations are simplified by simply setting <em>c</em> and <em>ħ</em> to 1.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>OK, we all know that it is completely hopeless to convert the world to using τ instead of π. Just as it is &ldquo;completely hopeless&rdquo; for the United States to become a multi-party political system or abolish the Electoral College.</p>

<p><strong>Nevertheless, <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~palais/pi.html">π is wrong!</a></strong></p>

<p>Oh, and on June 28 this year, you bet I&rsquo;ll be celebrating Tau Day.</p>

<p>P.S. Please don&rsquo;t take any of this too seriously: I don&rsquo;t!</p>
