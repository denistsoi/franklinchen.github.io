    <h1>Quitting the CMU All-University Orchestra: one of the hardest decisions in my life</h1>
    

<p>It&rsquo;s the Monday after what would have been the regular Sunday evening CMU All-University Orchestra rehearsal, except that there was no rehearsal because of Spring Break.</p>

<p>Surprise (or not)!</p>

<p>I have decided to immediately <em>quit</em> the CMU AUO that I had <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/02/01/joining-an-orchestra-learning-in-the-face-of-terror/">just joined less than two months ago</a>.</p>

<p>I have already told everyone that I&rsquo;m quitting.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t like quitting. I don&rsquo;t like being a quitter.</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s the story? And what next?</p>

<h2 id="orchestra-morale-problems">Orchestra morale problems</h2>

<p>Five days ago, I reported on <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/03/07/flute-taking-a-break-while-clarifying-my-goals/">problems in the orchestra</a> and deciding that I would probably quit the orchestra after the spring term is over. The memories of that have lingered in my mind. And my relief yesterday at not having rehearsal was a real message to me.</p>

<h3 id="update-of-2012-03-21">(Update of 2012-03-21)</h3>

<p>Maria just sent the mailing list (which I&rsquo;m still on despite having quit the orchestra) an email saying, &ldquo;It seems that over spring break we may have lost much of what we did in the first portion of the semester.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No kidding. As I had observed earlier, people clearly just weren&rsquo;t taking practice seriously. They probably didn&rsquo;t touch their instruments when they went on spring break. I&rsquo;m so glad I quit.</p>

<h2 id="personal-musical-goals">Personal musical goals</h2>

<p>In the past couple of days while off the hook on orchestral practice, I had an opportunity to think about <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/03/10/flute-loving-it-again/">what I actually love about music, and what role I want it to play in my life</a>.</p>

<h3 id="a-chance-opportunity">A chance opportunity</h3>

<p>It turns out that Abby and I have just been invited to a St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day party by Henry, whose <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/01/27/a-new-friends-very-musical-birthday-party-changed-my-life/">birthday party less than two months ago</a> had so moved me musically (and right after I had joined the AUO). I was so eager to attend that I asked Henry whether I should bring a tin whistle and play some Irish music, and he said, sure! I had promised myself after his birthday party that if we were ever invited to a party by him, I would play music.</p>

<h2 id="brute-reality">Brute reality</h2>

<p>Today, I can no longer deny the reality: being in an orchestra is <em>completely contrary</em> to the kind of musical life I actually enjoy and want. I need to play music of my choice, I want to improvise, I want to play in small groups. The task of mastering some difficult flute parts in a big orchestral work and being a tiny part of a performance, <em>does not appeal to me at all</em>, even if I could do it well (which I currently cannot at all).</p>

<p>As a concrete example: I could spend my time this week slogging away at AUO music practice, or I could be learning some tunes on tin whistle so that I can play them on Saturday at Henry&rsquo;s party and have a blast.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no comparison, whether in the short term or in the long term.</p>

<p>But emotionally, it&rsquo;s just tough to quit.</p>

<h2 id="what-did-i-really-ever-hope-to-get-out-of-orchestra">What did I really ever hope to get out of orchestra?</h2>

<p>I think part of me hoped that somehow, being in an orchestra was a standard rite of passage that a &ldquo;serious&rdquo; musician should do. When I was a kid, I was kind of envious that classmates joined the school orchestra, while I remained out of music entirely. My younger sister played violin in various orchestras in middle school and in high school and college.</p>

<p>But now it occurs to me that not much of what I could get out of orchestra would help me with my real musical goals anyway.</p>

<h2 id="the-art-of-quitting">The art of quitting</h2>

<p>I have a policy of never just <em>quitting</em> something, but <em>replacing</em> the void instead. <em>Quitting</em> is negative. <em>Replacing</em> is positive. In my case, quitting orchestra frees up a considerable amount of time to work toward my real musical goals. Instead of fruitlessly working on difficult flute parts that are currently beyond my capabilities, and beyond my interests, I can focus on gradually improving at the music I do want to play, and building the technique necessary, without arbitrary deadlines like some big concert.</p>

<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>

<p>In the United States, we are constantly bombarded with messages in the media and general culture not to be a &ldquo;quitter&rdquo;. And I got that a lot from my parents (who came from Taiwan) when I was a kid.</p>

<p>My current point of view: <em>not learning to be an effective quitter was the single worst mistake of my first decades in life</em>.</p>

<p>Here are some articles that really resonated with me about the benefits of quitting correctly:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.projecthappilyeverafter.com/2009/03/sometimes-its-better-to-be-a-quitter/">&ldquo;Sometimes it&rsquo;s better to be a quitter&rdquo;</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cormackcarr.com/2009/12/05/how-to-be-a-quitter/">&ldquo;How to be a quitter&rdquo;</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s never easy for me to quit something. Part of me always feels like I failed, wasn&rsquo;t good enough, wasn&rsquo;t courageous enough, or something like that. Maybe sometimes that is actually true. But other times, it clearly is not. All signs point to quitting orchestra as the best thing I can do now for my flute playing.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-your-own-relationship-to-quitting">What is your own relationship to quitting?</h2>

<p>What is your gut reaction when hearing about someone quitting (like me just now), or when considering quitting something yourself? Is your <em>gut reaction</em> one of disdain and shame, or of liberation? Is this a result of your upbringing, or the nature of your relationships with peers? Is it a deliberate rational philosophical position? Or is primarily emotional, based on either moral sentiment or ego?</p>

<p>When was the last time you quit and felt <em>good</em> about it? When was the last time you quit and felt <em>bad</em> about it? When was the last time you quit and <em>at the time</em> felt one way, but later felt you had made the wrong decision?</p>
