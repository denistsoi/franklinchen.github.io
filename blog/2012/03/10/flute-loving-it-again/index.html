    <h1>Flute: loving it again, remembering why I dance, and how I met my wife!</h1>
    

<p>Yesterday, after four days of <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/03/07/flute-taking-a-break-while-clarifying-my-goals">not even touching my (modern) flute</a> and having spent the time having fun with my Baroque flute instead, I felt the urge to return to the modern flute.</p>

<p>I still have not regained the inclination to continue working on the orchestra music I still have to improve a lot on in the coming week, but I rediscovered the joy of simply playing my instrument.</p>

<h2 id="sound-intonation">Sound, intonation</h2>

<p>The perpetual challenges of getting clean sounds and accurate pitches on the Baroque flute in the past four days have given me an increased appreciation for the modern flute. I picked it up and spent time just trying to make beautiful sounds. Freed from the stress of orchestra practice, I felt much more relaxed on the instrument than I have for a while now.</p>

<p>To my surprise (but not really), I have improved considerably on the flute after not playing it for four days. I really needed a break, a consolidation of lessons learned. My production of tones is much improved, and high notes are squeaking less.</p>

<h2 id="music-for-dance">Music for dance</h2>

<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve truly come to realize is that I particularly enjoy playing rhythmic music suitable for dancing.</p>

<p>Indeed, every time I attend a dance, and there is live music, I experience a strange internal conflict: I do like to dance, but sometimes, I&rsquo;d rather be on the other side of the dance floor, being the musical performer! The <em>only</em> time I&rsquo;ve been on the other side has been at last year&rsquo;s <a href="http://pittsburghcontra.org/">Pittsburgh Contras and Squares</a> Holiday Ball.</p>

<p>The most recent instance of my wishing I could sometimes stop dancing and just join the musicians has been at the local <a href="http://coalcountry.org/frenchdance.html">Pittsburgh French dance workshop and social</a>, where we&rsquo;ve had live piano, fiddle, and of course, <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~gdyke/">Gregory</a> on his Irish flute. I wonder whether at some point I might be qualified to play for the event, using either my modern flute or Baroque flute. (By the way, it was held again today, but unfortunately, Abby and I chose not to go because we had too many things to do this weekend.)</p>

<h2 id="remembering-dancing">Remembering dancing</h2>

<p>Yesterday I spent time playing along to a score/CD set I&rsquo;ve mentioned before, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/World-Music-Cuba-Flute-play-along/dp/3702465804">World Music Cuba</a>. While playing the bolero, cha cha, and mambo pieces in particular, I felt I was returning &ldquo;home&rdquo; in many ways. This was among the first music I heard and saw people dancing to when I was curious and visited the <a href="http://cmubdc.org/">CMU Ballroom Dance Club</a> in 2000, and fell in love with, and learned to dance to. I also played along to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Play-along-Argentina-Flute-World-Music/dp/3702465871">World Music Argentina</a>.</p>

<h3 id="some-photos-of-my-ballroom-dance-days">Some photos of my ballroom dance days</h3>

<p>Here are some photos of me dancing in 2002 with my last dance partner, Amy, before I quit competitive ballroom dancing.</p>

<p>Here we are at the <a href="http://www.dcdancesportinferno.com/">DC DanceSport Inferno</a> in 2002 doing a hockey stick in international rumba:</p>

<h2 id="dancing-with-abby">Dancing with Abby</h2>

<p>But never mind the ballroom dance days. It was through salsa dancing that I met my wife!</p>

<h3 id="how-i-met-abby">How I met Abby</h3>

<p>It was through dancing that I met Abby in the first place. After quitting dancing in 2003, I never danced again until late 2006, when my friend Jon told me he had recently started salsa dancing (because of a girlfriend who got him into it) and invited me to join him at a free outdoors dance, and I went. Then as I re-entered the Pittsburgh salsa dance scene, I kept running into Abby.</p>

<h3 id="some-photos-of-us-dancing-salsa">Some photos of us dancing salsa</h3>

<p>There are not many photos of Abby dancing with me, because when I&rsquo;m dancing, I&rsquo;m not holding my camera, but here are some photos a friend took at a big salsa dance weekend at the Palisades in McKeesport in April 2008, a year after we started dating in 2007.</p>

<h2 id="expression-and-improvisation-in-dance-and-in-music">Expression and improvisation in dance and in music</h2>

<h3 id="dance">Dance</h3>

<p>One reason I gave up ballroom dancing was that I felt there was an overemphasis on &ldquo;syllabus steps&rdquo; (I realize this is an oversimplification of the ballroom dance culture; all very good ballroom dancers go beyond the syllabus mindset). After quitting ballroom dancing, I explored Argentine tango, which is all about improvisation, but I left it because (at the time) it seemed that most of the women in the local scene were very tall, which made dancing awkward for me. I got into salsa because freed from the closed embrace, there was clearly a lot of room for personal improvisation. Ironically, I first got into making stuff up as a result of my imperfect memory: I could never memorize long choreography of step patterns, whether I was doing ballroom dancing or anything else. So I would always make a &ldquo;mistake&rdquo;, then I would make something out of the mistake. I learned that as long as you get back in time with the music, and keep the lead and follow communication strong, there is no such thing really as a mistake. You just keep going, with whatever is happening at the present moment.</p>

<p>I now have a long-term goal of developing my technique and releasing my inhibitions so that I can improvise musically at will. Yesterday, I played with improvising when playing bolero, cha cha, and tango. It was a lot of fun and profoundly satisfying.</p>

<h3 id="music">Music</h3>

<p>I actually credit my study of the recorder and the Baroque flute for reawakening me to my dream of free expression and improvisation. Baroque music leaves room for a lot of interpretation of trills and ornamentation and articulation (subject, of course, to &ldquo;good taste&rdquo;). I want to go beyond that, but it has been a great starting point. For some reason, too much exposure to later music (such as Beethoven) had turned me into a score-reader, since such later music has so much already marked up for the performer to simply <em>obey</em>. The sparse annotations in Renaissance and Baroque music give one much more freedom.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I am enjoying playing the flute again, now that I know what I really want to do with it. And I would like to merge my dance and music lives, just as Abby has always played the Balkan music she also dances to.</p>

<h2 id="update-of-2012-03-12">(Update of 2012-03-12)</h2>

<p>I ended up <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/03/12/quitting-the-cmu-all-university-orchestra-one-of-the-hardest-decisions-in-my-life/">quitting the CMU AUO</a>.</p>

<h2 id="update-of-2013-01-26">(Update of 2013-01-26)</h2>

<p>Almost a year later, I finally played tangos on flute <a href="../../../../../blog/2013/01/26/music-i-just-played-for-the-first-time-recorder-sonata-tangos/">at a party</a>.</p>

<h2 id="update-of-2013-03-17">(Update of 2013-03-17)</h2>

<p>Almost exactly a year later, I ended up playing selections from the World Music Cuba book <a href="../../../../../blog/2013/03/17/finally-doing-some-latin-music-jamming-on-flute/">at a party</a>, and improvising freely with two other guys!</p>
