    <h1>What I did immediately after the National Day of Unplugging</h1>
    

<p><a href="../../../../../blog/2012/03/22/paradox-i-will-observe-the-national-day-of-unplugging-but-just-bought-my-first-smartphone-this-week/">The past 24 hours</a>, I observed the <a href="http://nationaldayofunplugging.org/">National Day of Unplugging</a>.</p>

<p>This is not a report on what I learned during that experience. I will be working on that report, which will probably be spread out over multiple posts.</p>

<p>This is a report of what I did, &ldquo;plugged in&rdquo;, right after the event ended.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-immediately-did-after-finishing-the-national-day-of-unplugging">What I immediately did after finishing the National Day of Unplugging</h2>

<ul>
<li>Made a phone call to Abby, who has been in North Carolina since yesterday.</li>
<li>Turned on my home computer.</li>
<li>Announced on Facebook and Twitter that I was back from unplugging! (Funny that this is the first thing I did online.)</li>
<li>Checked my emails: I have around 30 to deal with. That&rsquo;s not bad, but I know that usually, I receive the least email on Saturdays.</li>
<li>Started to &ldquo;catch up&rdquo; on my RSS feeds, Facebook, Twitter, Google+.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="emails-i-missed">Emails I missed</h2>

<ul>
<li>Notification about a Meetup event for tomorrow morning. If I had known about it earlier, I might have planned today differently. It is &ldquo;too late&rdquo; now to change tomorrow&rsquo;s plans, so I will not be attending that event. (There is a different Meetup event I&rsquo;m going to in the afternoon.)</li>
<li>Notification about multiple Meetup events further in the future I may be interested in attending; need to look at the details and add to my online calendar if I decide to go.</li>
<li>Party invitation on Facebook. <strong>This is why I can&rsquo;t quit Facebook; people actually use it.</strong> Need to look at my online calendar and discuss with Abby.</li>
<li>Continuing old and new email threads involving various friends; I need to catch up and participate.</li>
<li>Notifications about new comments in my blog&rsquo;s threads and other people&rsquo;s blogs&rsquo; threads where I&rsquo;d indicated I want to be notified; sometimes this is useful, but other times less so. I will respond promptly to the comment on my old blog post.</li>
<li>Never-ending emails about new bills and statements I need to inspect and deal with.</li>
<li>Notifications about a bunch of new people following me on Twitter. I&rsquo;ve long since given up on looking up every single new follower (or unfollower). I do like to make note of Pittsburgh locals I may have met in person or should meet, however.</li>
<li>Various mailing lists and other notifications.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="facebook">Facebook</h2>

<p>OK, so it took about 15 minutes to catch up on browsing Facebook. That&rsquo;s actually longer than I expected. Typically I check Facebook once or twice a day, and I&rsquo;ve imagined that I don&rsquo;t spend more than 5 minutes a day on Facebook, but apparently I&rsquo;m wrong. Interesting.</p>

<p>I believe I should spend less time on Facebook, because in reality, most of what I see there is not really necessary for me to see; it&rsquo;s just idle people-watching for me, and the value of that is unclear to me.</p>

<h2 id="google">Google+</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest: I spend very little time on Google+. It&rsquo;s just not where most people I know (as in &ldquo;non-geeks&rdquo;) are.</p>

<h2 id="rss-feeds">RSS feeds</h2>

<p>Lots of articles to sort through. For fun, as I go through them to save those I cannot just skim in 15 seconds, but want to read in depth later, I am listing the topics of the saved ones here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eclipse plugin for automatic Javadoc comments</li>
<li>Improvised Persian music for Nowruz</li>
<li>Claims that Twitter Bootstrap is the way to go for web site design</li>
<li>Privacy and how to pay for it</li>
<li>Formal mathematical model of film success or failure</li>
<li>How to fix local issues: government or not?</li>
<li>The stresses on women in today&rsquo;s world</li>
<li>Plight of the introvert</li>
<li>Calibre and freedom for ebooks</li>
<li>Guido and callbacks in Python</li>
<li>A new blogging platform called Svbtle (sic)</li>
<li>Collection of historical chess footage on YouTube</li>
</ul>

<p>Saturday is a slow day. On a weekday I typically find more new stuff to read.</p>

<h2 id="twitter">Twitter</h2>

<p>Finally, I hit Twitter, to scroll down and see what I missed. I get tremendous value from Twitter, actually, that I cannot get from other sources. Perhaps that is the subject for a future blog post.</p>

<h2 id="my-new-smartphone">My new smartphone</h2>

<p>I still need to get going on setting up and really using my new smartphone. This task may need to wait until Monday or Tuesday, since I have a lot of stuff I need to get done tonight and tomorrow.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about the first things I&rsquo;ve done after getting back online. I&rsquo;ll continue monitoring my online activities as they happen. One thing &ldquo;unplugging&rdquo; has done for me is give me (at least temporarily) a more conscious than usual awareness of what I do online. This will be a step toward streamlining my online activities.</p>
