<p>Tonight was the first round of the latest six-round Tuesday night tournament at the <a href="http://pittsburghcc.org/">Pittsburgh Chess Club</a>, <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/08/29/returning-to-chess/">my first tournament in almost two years</a>, the 14th Fred Sorensen Memorial.</p>

<h2 id="the-tournament">The tournament</h2>

<p>There was quite a large turnout for this tournament. Apparently a good number of people who had not played for a while (like me), chose to come back also! There were also new faces.</p>

<p>Always most striking to me after I&rsquo;ve been away for a while is to see kids whom I haven&rsquo;t seen in years, because they often end up many feet taller! They are dangerous opponents, because they typically are growing their chess as rapidly as they are growing taller.</p>

<p>I am the highest-rated player in the tournament, as I often used to be. However, since I have not played in tournament conditions in a while, I need to warm back up to my past tournament strength.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-my-purpose">What is my purpose?</h3>

<p>A bunch of guys noticed that I was &ldquo;back&rdquo; and ribbed me about it, asking me if I was back to dominate or to have fun. I replied, in all seriousness, that I am back for <em>fun</em>. Sure, I want to win, but I don&rsquo;t want to get obsessive about chess again.</p>

<h2 id="the-game">The game</h2>

<p>This being round one, I played against someone considerably lower-rated than me, but someone who has certainly won or drawn games against me in the past. Lower-rated doesn&rsquo;t mean a guaranteed loss, else there would be no point in playing. I try to take all my opponents seriously, no matter what their rating. I actually have learned the hard way that <em>disrespect</em> has a way of resulting in blowback. I must earn every win I achieve.</p>

<p>My opponent and I both played fairly quickly. The last time I played in tournaments, I was very doubtful of myself and overthought trying to compensate. So for this tournament, I have decided to try to relax and play reasonable moves without overthinking and trying to absolutely optimize as a computer would.</p>

<p>I ended up winning in less than an hour, by smashing through as White using the classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_gift_sacrifice">Greek gift sacrifice</a>. I have used this sacrifice in several games over my life. It&rsquo;s always cute to use it. I have accidentally fallen victim to it in the past also!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I was pleased to see a large turnout at the latest Tuesday night tournament at the Pittsburgh Chess Club, including old faces as well as new ones. I played a clean game in which I managed to use the Greek gift sacrifice to quickly win. I enjoyed not only the win, but what I felt to be sound, correct play on my part. A good start for me in this tournament, but I expect next week to be much tougher!</p>
