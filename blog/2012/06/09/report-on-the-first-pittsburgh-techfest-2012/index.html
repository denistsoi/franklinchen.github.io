<p>I was excited to attend the very first <a href="http://pghtechfest.com/">Pittsburgh TechFest</a>, held at <a href="http://www.laroche.edu/">LaRoche College</a>.</p>

<p>This was my first local programming conference since some Perl conferences years ago!</p>

<h2 id="why-attend">Why attend?</h2>

<p>In the past couple of years, I have increasingly explored <a href="../../../../../blog/2011/10/16/pittsburgh-software-developer-communities/">Pittsburgh&rsquo;s growing programmer meetup scene</a>, but I wanted to expand beyond that to start attending some local conferences, so of course I was going to attend this one. (I had to cancel a hiking/camping outing in order to make it!)</p>

<h2 id="the-venue">The venue</h2>

<p>LaRoche College is in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Hills_(Pennsylvania)">North Hills</a>, about a twenty-minute drive (in light traffic conditions) from the city of Pittsburgh. This was the first time I&rsquo;d been in LaRoche. They had a decent amount of space for all the sessions for the conference. I think the venue worked out great, and we were also provided lunch in the cafeteria.</p>

<h2 id="keynote">Keynote</h2>

<p>The keynote speech was by <a href="http://www.docondev.com/">Michael &ldquo;Doc&rdquo; Norton</a> of <a href="http://leandog.com/">LeanDog</a>. He talked about our shared goal, as evidenced by attending the conference, of becoming an &ldquo;excellent software developer&rdquo;. He emphasized the <em>polyglot</em> nature of the conference, which was organized by members of various local communities including .NET and Java, among others. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t work alone today,&rdquo; he emphasized. He urged us to broaden ourselves at the conference, and go to talks about topics outside of our own comfortable experience. He used the concept of the &ldquo;T&rdquo; as something to aspire to: having deep knowledge in something but also having broad knowledge of other things.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the keynote speech and resolved to check out ideas new to me that I might be able to use. The speech actually caused me to spontaneously change some of my original marked-down preferences for which sessions I would attend!</p>

<h3 id="update-of-2013-06-01">(Update of 2013-06-01)</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Doc&rdquo; has in the past year moved to Groupon.</p>

<h2 id="overview-of-sessions">Overview of sessions</h2>

<p>The problem I (well, all of us) faced for this conference was that there was a huge number of concurrent talks on all kinds of topics in any given time slot. There were over 30 speakers and over 40 sessions, all in a single day.</p>

<p>This meant having to decide what to attend and what to miss. Topics came from areas such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>.NET</li>
<li>Node</li>
<li>CoffeeScript</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>Selenium</li>
<li>Kinect</li>
<li>Scala</li>
<li>UX</li>
<li>Agile</li>
<li>Backbone</li>
<li>REST</li>
<li>iOS</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sessions-i-attended">Sessions I attended</h2>

<h3 id="user-experience-maps-for-agile-modeling-maria-emerson-http-www-mariaemerson-com">User Experience Maps for Agile Modeling (<a href="http://www.mariaemerson.com/">Maria Emerson</a>)</h3>

<p>The first session I attended was completely outside of my usual world, involving <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design">&ldquo;user experience&rdquo; (UX)</a>. I chose it because it was a hands-on workshop. I freely confess that I am usually not very excited by sitting around listening to someone talk and put up code on slides; I feel I could do that at home by myself.</p>

<p>Maria led us through a simulation of the kind of work she does. We broke up into teams, we were told to design a mobile app for rowers who rent from a boat house, and used sticky notes, a whiteboard, and &ldquo;butcher paper&rdquo; as we went through an abbreviated version of the work flow of figuring out what the app should do and what issues it should address. I thought it was a fantastic workshop.</p>

<h3 id="creating-your-own-software-company-kendall-miller">Creating Your Own Software Company (Kendall Miller)</h3>

<p>The second session was, again, about something I&rsquo;m not currently doing and is new to me.</p>

<p>It was by a .NET guy from <a href="http://www.gibraltarsoftware.com/">Gibraltar Software</a> who talked about the nuts and bolts of starting, and especially sustaining, a software company. I learned a lot from his presentation and the discussions, about handling such resources as time, funding, pricing, and especially the <em>psychology</em> of the customer, as well as self-psychology.</p>

<p>For example, he emphasized looking at the <em>market</em> first, when coming up with a conscious plan to achieve &ldquo;deliberate success&rdquo;, rather than get carried away by idealism or fuzzy hopes. He argued that <em>marketing</em> is what it&rsquo;s all about, and that all business is about <em>people</em> relating to <em>people</em>.</p>

<p>Very informative and fascinating session!</p>

<h3 id="lunch">Lunch</h3>

<p>Lunch was surprisingly high quality and filling, in the campus cafeteria.</p>

<h3 id="you-say-tomato-i-say-pomodoro-joel-cochran">You say Tomato, I say Pomodoro (Joel Cochran)</h3>

<p>After lunch, I went to a session about the <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro Technique</a> of time management. I had heard about the Pomodoro Technique for some time, but it sounded bizarre, and I never experimented with implementing it myself.</p>

<p>I took some notes, but left not really feeling convinced that I would try the technique.</p>

<h3 id="introduction-to-actors-using-scala-josh-suereth-http-jsuereth-com">Introduction to Actors using Scala (<a href="http://jsuereth.com/">Josh Suereth</a>)</h3>

<p>I first met Josh almost two years ago, when he gave a talk in October 2010 for <a href="http://java.net/projects/pittjug/">PittJUG</a>, &ldquo;Why you want to learn Scala&rdquo;. After that, he has periodically come to more PittJUG meetings, such as a nice <a href="../../../../../blog/2011/10/26/open-spaces-success-at-the-pittsburgh-java-users-group/">&ldquo;open spaces&rdquo; one we had last year</a>. Josh had this morning given a talk &ldquo;Introduction to Functional Programming using Scala&rdquo; that I had skipped, but I attended this one because I had always meant to look into using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">actors</a> for concurrency.</p>

<p>Josh gave a nice presentation that left me knowing that I definitely wanted to look into actors (and Scala) further.</p>

<p>Oh, and he was plugging his new book <a href="http://www.manning.com/suereth/">Scala in Depth</a>. I went and bought the ebook when I got home! It&rsquo;s good.</p>

<h3 id="hypermedia-api-design-steve-klabnik-http-steveklabnik-com">Hypermedia API Design (<a href="http://steveklabnik.com/">Steve Klabnik</a>)</h3>

<p>The final session I attended was an unusual one. Steve Klabnik gave a fairly philosophical rather than technical talk about <a href="http://www.designinghypermediaapis.com/">hypermedia API design</a>. He spoke about the need to make sure the Web remains open and flexible. His point of view is that &ldquo;everything is politics&rdquo;, so when we&rsquo;re talking about how applications can and should communicate with each other, we have some implicit political vision in mind.</p>

<p>The presentation was kind of abstract for me, probably because I don&rsquo;t currently do much with Web application design. He spoke of metadata, interpretation, and dynamic contracts. If I end up in the Web world again sometime, I&rsquo;ll try to figure out exactly what Steve was trying to say!</p>

<h2 id="what-next">What next?</h2>

<p>I took a lot of notes that I hope to study and use in my career as a software developer. Also, I&rsquo;m inspired by seeing so many people I know giving talks. At some point, I should start sharing what I know by giving presentations also.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s <a href="http://updyke.com/blog/2012/06/09/pittsburgh-techfest-2012/">another participant&rsquo;s review of the Pittsburgh TechFest</a>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the organizers of the very first Pittsburgh TechFest, and the sponsors who made the conference so inexpensive and accessible. And of course, I appreciate everyone who signed on to give a presentation. I learned a lot over the course of the day, and look forward to another Pittsburgh TechFest in 2013!</p>

<p>I went to <a href="../../../../../blog/2013/06/01/report-on-the-second-pittsburgh-techfest-2013/">Pittsburgh TechFest again in 2013</a>, and had a great time, despite being sick. Also, as I had promised myself a year ago, I gave a presentation there! <a href="../../../../../blog/2013/06/01/pittsburgh-tech-fest-2013-my-talk-stop-overusing-regular-expressions/">Full report here</a>.</p>
