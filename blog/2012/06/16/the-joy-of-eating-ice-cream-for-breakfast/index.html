<p>Recently I started eating ice cream for breakfast. I was amused because this was something I haven&rsquo;t done since I was a child, when my sister and I managed for a while to convince our parents to let us eat ice cream for breakfast.</p>

<p>Is there a contradiction between my eating ice cream for breakfast and my supposedly paying attention to my health?</p>

<h2 id="how-my-sister-and-i-got-to-eat-ice-cream-as-kids">How my sister and I got to eat ice cream as kids</h2>

<p>As kids, my sister and I loved ice cream, of course. We managed to find a way to sometimes eat it for breakfast. Basically, we volunteered to make breakfast on some weekends. We had found some kid-oriented &ldquo;cookbooks&rdquo; at a garage sale or something at some point, and we learned about cinnamon toast and other such &ldquo;American&rdquo; breakfasts that were foreign to our parents. It was fun for us to take charge of breakfast once in a while, and have an excuse to make super-sugary concoctions to eat.</p>

<p>Frankly, it was easy enough for us in general to just say, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re eating American style&rdquo;, in order to avoid eating rice porridge with dried shrimp bits and pork bone broth and greens (to tell the truth, I actually liked that, but at some point wanted to eat &ldquo;American&rdquo; like my classmates). But it was even more fun to be able to say, &ldquo;We found this recipe in a <em>book</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A couple of times, we managed to get ice cream into the picture. We must have found a recipe that called for it. We got frozen waffles, and prepared them with syrup and topped with ice cream. I remember that being pretty good.</p>

<h2 id="but-ice-cream-is-not-a-good-food">But ice cream is not a good food</h2>

<p>I have to explain that Abby and I don&rsquo;t eat ice cream much any more. We&rsquo;ve found that it is too sugary and makes us feel tired or bloated in large quantities. You don&rsquo;t have to be <a href="../../../../../categories/paleo/">paleo</a> to understand and experience the drawbacks of ice cream (not that we&rsquo;re strictly paleo anyway).</p>

<p>However, I&rsquo;m a big believer in <a href="http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/most_recent/in_defense_of_cheat_days">intermittent cheating</a>, so I&rsquo;m happy to eat ice cream now and then as a special treat, but otherwise, I don&rsquo;t really need it.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-had-to-eat-ice-cream-for-breakfast">Why I had to eat ice cream for breakfast</h2>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t buy this bucket of Trader Joe&rsquo;s Coffee Bean Blast ice cream; Abby did. She thought it would be a nice post-<a href="../../../../../categories/hiking/">hike</a> treat. Unfortunately, it has turned out in the past months that whenever we go out on a weekend for a hike or some other outdoors adventure, we come back in the evening, and it&rsquo;s too late to eat this ice cream.</p>

<p>The problem is caffeine. Eating this ice cream would mess up our night of sleep. In fact, I verified this once, eating some of the ice cream in the evening: oops.</p>

<p>Frustrated, I didn&rsquo;t know when I <em>could</em> eat this coffee ice cream. Clearly, the only time I could possibly eat it would be before late afternoon. Furthermore, the only safe context for me to eat something like this would be after I exercised. Since I have a preference for exercising in the morning before breakfast anyway, the perfect time for eating this ice cream was breakfast. Generally, after exercising, I can eat sugary foods to an extent without compromising my energy levels.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-did-to-earn-my-breakfast">What I did to earn my breakfast</h2>

<p>I went for a five-mile <a href="../../../../../categories/running/">run</a> in <a href="../../../../../categories/frick-park/">Frick Park</a>. I wore my Vibram FiveFingers Bikila LS shoes.</p>

<h2 id="my-real-breakfast">My real breakfast</h2>

<p>At breakfast, I eat only two spoons of ice cream, actually. That is enough to satisfy me. At this rate, I&rsquo;ll take forever to finish that tub. More reason for me to exercise every morning this summer!</p>

<p>I followed up with the rest of my breakfast, which is typical of what I&rsquo;ve been eating since <a href="../../../../../blog/2011/10/23/paleo-diet-experimentation/">completely abandoning my former oatmeal breakfast</a>.</p>

<p>Oh, and Abby I have signed up for the <a href="http://www.brentwood5k.com/">Brentwood Firecracker 5K race</a>. I last did that race eleven years ago, in 2001. I have a serious goal of beating my time from that year!</p>

<p>I have only two more weeks of training with ice cream, before running the race. Wish me luck!</p>
