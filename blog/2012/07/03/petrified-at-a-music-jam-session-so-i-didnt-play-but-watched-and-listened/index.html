    <h1>Petrified at a music jam session so I didn&#39;t play but watched and listened</h1>
    

<p><a href="../../../../../blog/2012/07/02/my-first-french-music-jam-anxious-but-excited">Just yesterday, I went to a music jam</a> and was anxious but got over that and participated.</p>

<p>Today Abby and I went to a <em>very different</em> one, a potluck/music jam hosted by Susan Waggoner, whom we&rsquo;ve known for a long time through various Pittsburgh music and dance activities. Susan is involved particularly in the Cajun music/dance scene, and was also in the <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/local/neighborhoods-city/accordion-pool-partys-another-use-for-empty-lawrenceville-pool-357459/">Accordion Pool Party</a> that Abby played in three years ago, and also has been doing <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/01/23/discovering-french-traditional-dance-in-pittsburgh/">French dancing</a> with us.</p>

<p>I was so <em>terrified</em> at this party that I didn&rsquo;t play <em>at all</em>, despite bringing my instruments. I just didn&rsquo;t feel up to it. But I learned a lot.</p>

<h2 id="two-main-groups-of-musicians">Two main groups of musicians</h2>

<p>It turned out that there were a bunch of musicians playing music outside in the back of the home. I wasn&rsquo;t super familiar with what they were playing. Then there were some musicians playing music inside in the living room.</p>

<p>They really knew what they were doing, and were singing and playing by ear, no scores in sight. Without any scores, I had no clue how I could contribute, so I didn&rsquo;t even take out my instruments. This was <em>real</em> jamming, not the kind that I did yesterday where most (but not all) of the stuff we did involved songs I had brought scores for or at least had heard before.</p>

<h3 id="old-time-music">Old time music</h3>

<p>I was told by the men and women who were inside that those outside were playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old-time_music">&ldquo;old time&rdquo;</a> music. I hadn&rsquo;t been familiar with the term or genre.</p>

<p>Abby liked being outside, and also has been playing mandolin, so spent time checking out that group. I think she played along some too. It seemed to be mostly fiddlers, with banjo, mandolin, percussion, etc.</p>

<p>I checked it out, but the music happened not to be quite so interesting to me; it moved fast, had a lot of notes, but seemed somewhat monotonous to my taste.</p>

<h3 id="country-blues-music">Country blues music</h3>

<p>Inside, however, I was really captivated by what was going on. They said that they were playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_blues">&ldquo;country blues&rdquo;</a>. I liked the harmonic changes and the rhythmic qualities and improvisation. Guitars, harmonica, piano, singing. I was impressed by how the singers made up entire lyrics on the spot, often very funny or off-color.</p>

<p>I stayed around inside soaking in what was going on, and thought, I could see myself someday playing along.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I was really excited to meet more musicians and widen my musical experience at the potluck/jam session. I felt pretty inspired by what I saw going on, music as a really communal, creative experience.</p>

<p>Noticing the huge gap between what these musicians were able to do and what I am able to do, I know that it takes a long time to get where they are, but I want to have that kind of everyday facility.</p>

<h3 id="update-of-2012-07-07">(Update of 2012-07-07)</h3>

<p>Four days later, we went to another potluck/jam session, and <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/07/07/another-terrifying-music-jam-session-but-i-played-a-little-bit-of-blues-and-old-time/">I played a little bit</a>.</p>

<h3 id="update-of-2013-01-28">(Update of 2013-01-28)</h3>

<p>Seven months later, I participated in <a href="../../../../../blog/2013/01/28/my-first-blues-music-jam-happened-after-the-regular-french-music-jam/">my first blues jam</a>. The pianist there, Anders, was the same one I first saw here.</p>

<p>At <a href="../../../../../blog/2013/07/03/second-year-at-july-3-music-party-still-only-listening-without-playing/">my second year</a> of this annual party, I still did not feel comfortable enough with the crowd to try to participate musically.</p>

<h3 id="update-of-2014-07-03">(Update of 2014-07-03)</h3>

<p>At <a href="../../../../../blog/2014/07/03/third-year-at-july-3-music-party-and-finally-participated-in-jamming/">my third year</a> of this annual party, I actually played both piano and ukulele!</p>
