    <h1>Round 4 of Pittsburgh Chess Club tournament: the agony of losing a won game against the difficult opponent</h1>
    

<p>After <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/11/27/round-3-of-pittsburgh-chess-club-tournament-the-difficult-opponent-and-revenge-of-the-bishop/">round 3 last week</a> of the current Pittsburgh Chess Club Tuesday night tournament, I noted that I was going to face a difficult opponent in round 4.</p>

<p>Well, I <strong>lost</strong> my game against him tonight, after four hours of play (we were the last game to finish):</p>

<p>This is the <em>first</em> chess game I&rsquo;ve reported on in this blog in which I lost!</p>

<h2 id="what-lessons-from-losing">What lessons from losing?!</h2>

<p>What makes this loss particularly agonizing is that I had an advantage for a long time in the game (and had a win at one point), and entered an endgame a solid Pawn up such that if I were playing for a draw, there would not be any way to fail, but instead I made error after error until I lost. Even worse, I actually had a drawn position just moves before I resigned.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what happened.</p>

<h2 id="the-complete-annotated-game">The complete annotated game</h2>

<p>At your convenience, you can <a href="../../../../../chess/chen-dean-2012-12-04.htm">enjoy playing over the game with my annotations, including diagrams.</a></p>

<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>

<p>I was faced with the psychological challenge of playing a &ldquo;difficult opponent&rdquo;, which I define as someone who I have a bad score against. I had lost one game to my opponent and <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/10/09/final-round-of-pittsburgh-chess-club-tournament-clawing-back-from-a-terrible-position-to-draw-and-tie-for-first/">drawn one game that I almost deserved to lose</a>.</p>

<p>As White, I had the choice of playing into one of his favorite openings or avoiding it. I ended up doing something halfway: allowing his opening but choosing a different way of responding to it. I did this with the expectation of reaching a certain kind of middle game that would be solid for me as White: a Ruy Lopez kind of position.</p>

<h2 id="overview-of-my-game">Overview of my game</h2>

<h3 id="the-opening">The opening</h3>

<p>My opponent again tried to enter the Philidor Defense through a Pirc Defense move order. I varied with the quiet <code>Bd3</code> variation in order to bolster my <code>e4</code> and <code>d4</code> center with <code>c3</code>.</p>

<p>I made some inaccuracies in the opening by not playing an early <code>Be3</code> that would have guaranteed a safe advantage.</p>

<p>Still, I achieved a solid position:</p>

        <h4>Opening</h4>

</figure>


<h3 id="the-middle">The middle</h3>

<p>Then, out of the blue, my opponent creatively embarked on a Pawn sacrifice.</p>

    <figcaption>
        <h4>Unsound sacrifice by Black</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>The way he played it was actually completely unsound, such that if I had taken the time to find the best moves, I would have won. But it was a creative idea: it was meant to be a positional sacrifice, choosing to lose a Pawn in order to gain the advantage of the two Bishops and better development. It should not have worked, however.</p>

    <figcaption>
        <h4>White is a solid Pawn up but lost the two Bishops</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>His bluff worked, and I fell into a position in which although I was one Pawn up and had the advantage, it was not going to be trivial to actually win rather than draw.</p>

<p>After I finished developing my pieces, I immediately traded into an endgame in which I was a Pawn up and objectively had <strong>no chance of losing</strong>.</p>

    <figcaption>
        <h4>Traded off</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<h3 id="the-end">The end</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s where things got weird. When I realized that I did not have much of a chance of winning, I started dreaming up strange attacks that ended up not working at all. I started losing Pawns, my Knight ended up much worse than his Bishop (thereby justifying his positional sacrifice in the first place to get the Bishop), and I was dead lost.</p>

        <img src="../../../../../chess/chen-dean-2012-12-04_files/diag3FA87E55F7AB1E66.gif" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>White in bad shape</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>Then magically, at some point he started playing poorly, to the point at which I finally achieved a drawn position!</p>

    <figcaption>
        <h4>Drawn position</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>But at that very moment, I played an incomprehensibly terrible move, and immediately after that, realized I was lost. The rest of the game was meaningless given that. I resigned when he was about to Queen a Pawn.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h2>

<ul>
<li>Even when playing a solid, safe opening, an enterprising opponent might be able to surprise with an unsound sacrifice that blows the position up.</li>
<li>I should have spent more time finding the refutation of the sacrificial line.</li>
<li>Simplifying to an ending is natural when ahead in material, but was the wrong thing to do when it was possible to maintain more tension.</li>
<li>In a drawn endgame, I got discouraged and started playing to <em>lose</em>. Terrible.</li>
<li>Even in a lost endgame, there are opportunities to draw; I missed the final drawing move.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-next">What next?</h2>

<p>Well, I now lose the lead in the tournament. I don&rsquo;t know yet whom I&rsquo;ll be playing in round 5. I have probably lost the chance to win this tournament, as a result of my loss, but I intend to play well during the final two rounds!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s always tough to lose a chess game. It&rsquo;s especially hard when you identify the kinds of errors you made and what you could have done differently and thought about but decided poorly.</p>
