    <h1>Report on my fifth day of Stoic Week 2014: action and the reserve clause</h1>
    

<p>I had some setbacks today, the fifth day of Stoic Week, but dealt with them.</p>

<h2 id="a-coconut-oil-accident-yesterday-at-thanksgiving-party">A coconut oil accident yesterday at Thanksgiving party</h2>

<p>By the time we left <a href="../../../../../blog/2014/11/27/report-on-my-fourth-day-of-stoic-week-2014/">yesterday&rsquo;s Thanksgiving party</a> in the evening, I wasn&rsquo;t feeling so well. I had blamed eating that one cookie and also drinking a bit of spicy warm cider, but as unpleasant symptoms developed (you don&rsquo;t need to know the details), I immediately knew what must have happened.</p>

<p>A bit of history, years ago I experimented with <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/01/26/improving-my-breakfast-and-other-meals/">using coconut oil</a> but found that I could tolerate only a little bit, and in fact quickly decided to just not use it any more in cooking, after some incidents in which I experienced very unpleasant symptoms after a meal and found out that Abby had used a good amount of coconut oil in cooking. We had her limit the use of coconut oil in cooking anything I was to eat.</p>

<p>So it had been quite some time since I experienced those symptoms, but unfortunately, I suffered for over twelve hours with poor sleep overnight, and can only conclude that a large mount of coconut oil was used in Thanksgiving dinner!</p>

<h2 id="my-system-temporarily-wrecked-illustrating-today-s-theme">My system temporarily wrecked, illustrating today&rsquo;s theme</h2>

<p>So I not only woke up late in the morning today, but was also still suffering physically, was hungry nonetheless, and grouchy. Normally I try to start my day with meditation, but I just wanted to eat breakfast. Abby had gotten up hours before me and was annoyed I had gotten up late, and snapped at me while I was bleary-eyed and trying to start eating breakfast. I snapped back, and she got very upset and disappeared.</p>

<p>While eating, I recognized that I had gone totally non-Stoic, and so after I finished eating and reading today&rsquo;s theme on &ldquo;action and the reserve clause&rdquo;, I immediately went to meditate for ten minutes before talking with her again, in a much calmer mood, explaining what had been happening.</p>

<p>I went back to napping, and then before lunch time, after my final visit to the toilet, I finally felt like my coconut oil disaster was truly over and I could start my day.</p>

<p>I felt I had &ldquo;failed&rdquo; in that, contrary to Stoic teaching, I had let my physical distress take over my mind and everything I was doing. I could have dealt better with my situation, acting the best I could despite my circumstance rather than giving into my foul mood.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;reserve clause&rdquo; in Stoicism refers to how we <em>act</em> even though we may not like what has happened or what might happen. I did not start the morning with this attitude.</p>

<h2 id="exercise">Exercise</h2>

<p>Abby and I eventually made up, but it really bothered me that I had started off the day so badly. I was also feeling like my muscles were trashed from yesterday&rsquo;s workout (and party play with the two sisters). Later in the afternoon, we went for a hike in Frick Park and both felt better. I considered that my &ldquo;exercise&rdquo; for the day, a lower-intensity day.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I had a setback in my practice of Stoicism but recovered, with even more appreciation for daily reading and study to get back on track.</p>

<p><strong>How do you deal with setbacks? Do you have a system, a philosophical principle, to keep you on track?</strong></p>
