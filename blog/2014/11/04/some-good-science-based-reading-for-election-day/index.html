    <h1>Some good science-based reading for Election Day, whether or not you voted</h1>
    

<p><a href="../../../../../blog/2014/11/01/how-i-avoid-demotivating-myself-away-from-voting/">I voted</a> today, on Election Day in the US.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/franklinmingchen/15527007380" title="IMG_20141104_153326 by Franklin Chen, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7496/15527007380_abfb7f5691.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="IMG_20141104_153326"></a></p>

<p>That said, now is as good a time as any for some interesting articles about politics and voting. Here are some that came my way:</p>

<h2 id="motive-attribution-asymmetry">Motive attribution asymmetry</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/oliver-burkeman-column/2014/nov/04/get-along-enemies-motive-attribution">Oliver Burkeman</a> discusses a study that shows that you argue that your side is motivated by <em>love</em>, while the other side is motivated by <em>hate</em>. But since the other side thinks the same, what is the &ldquo;truth&rdquo;?</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the reasons it’s so hard to accept the notion that our enemies might be motivated by love, I suspect, is because that conclusion seems to suggest that our enemies’ cause must therefore have merit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Actually, those two issues are completely unrelated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I agree with this: it is quite possible (I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s always the case) for someone you disagree with to have the most loving intentions, but simply be <em>mistaken</em> rather than <em>evil</em>.</p>

<h2 id="dangers-of-accurate-statistical-prediction-by-data-journalism">Dangers of accurate statistical prediction by data journalism</h2>

<p>A good article in the Berkeley Journal of Sociology about <a href="http://berkeleyjournal.org/2014/11/what-should-the-fox-say/">Nate Silver&rsquo;s statistical journalism</a> argues that data journalism should focus on understanding rather than prediction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This extensive use of Big Data for election forecasting passively promotes our current sense of political fatalism.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If our politicians can’t risk making public appearances or trying to appear human without navigating at least three levels of performative irony, then our political culture has entered a state of structural crisis.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="emotions-of-election-day-asymmetric-hedonic-response">Emotions of Election Day: asymmetric hedonic response</h2>

<p><a href="http://harvardmagazine.com/2014/11/emotions-of-elections-study-todd-rogers">Harvard Kennedy School research result</a> on asymmetric hedonic response: after an election, losing makes you far sadder than winning makes you happy.</p>

<p>I confess to having been really bummed out fairly often in the past two decades of voting. I&rsquo;ve been trying to be more detached.</p>

<h2 id="in-praise-of-the-occasional-voter">In praise of the occasional voter</h2>

<p>Sometimes, some people make fun of people who do not vote (I never do this; there are often quite rational reasons to avoid voting). Here&rsquo;s an interesting article arguing that the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/upshot/the-vital-role-of-the-occasional-voter.html">&ldquo;occasional voter&rdquo; is actually quite valuable</a>.</p>

<p>From an economics point of view, &ldquo;voting is a classic example of a free-rider problem&rdquo; because the possible gain for each individual is so tiny, statistically, that it may not make sense to go out of one&rsquo;s way to vote.</p>

<p>On the other hand, voting has an interesting cost to the voter: &ldquo;The very act of voting for a given candidate or party ties us mentally to that candidate and inadvertently costs us some measure of our neutrality.&rdquo; This is because we <em>rationalize</em> what we do in order to resolve our <em>cognitive dissonance</em> about the apparent pointlessness of voting. We try to fool ourselves into thinking we did something really important. &ldquo;We don’t just choose what we like; we like more and more what we choose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the &ldquo;occasional voter&rdquo; can be an outsider not subject to cognitive dissonance as much as the regular and party-registered voter, countering partisanship.</p>

<p>Of course, it could be argued that partisanship, and the resulting gridlock, is good. But is it? That&rsquo;s another topic entirely.</p>

<h2 id="the-strange-sameness-of-political-candidates-in-the-face-of-competition">The strange sameness of political candidates in the face of competition</h2>

<p>The Conversable Economist, Timothy Taylor, offered an explanation for <a href="http://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2014/11/the-excessive-sameness-of-politics-and.html">why politicians end up in the same squishy middle</a>, based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Hotelling">Hotelling</a>&rsquo;s famous 1929 mathematical model.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mainstream politicians thus face a continual dynamic where they seek to reassure their more ardent partisans that they are on their side, while shading and tacking as needed to pick up voters in the middle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the way, if you are interested in more mathematical modeling, check out Scott Page&rsquo;s free MOOC on &ldquo;model thinking&rdquo;, which I <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/06/16/review-of-coursera-course-model-thinking/">reviewed here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="bloggers-reactions-to-election-day">Bloggers&rsquo; reactions to Election Day</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a blogger I follow, <a href="http://ayjay.tumblr.com/post/101755797073/and-one-more-note-on-politics">Alan Jacobs, on his options</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/05/09/people-hate-congress-but-most-incumbents-get-re-elected-what-gives/">People hate Congress, but 90% of incumbents get re-elected</a>. &ldquo;The message from voters to Congress? Throw the bums out. But not my bum.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I hope you enjoyed this taste of research results concerning psychology, sociology, and economics.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not staying up to watch the returns from today&rsquo;s election. I did what I did, and it&rsquo;s over for me until next May.</p>
