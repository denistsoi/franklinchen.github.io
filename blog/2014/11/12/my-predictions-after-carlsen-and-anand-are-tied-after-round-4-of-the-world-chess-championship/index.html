    <h1>My predictions after Carlsen and Anand are tied after round 4 of the World Chess Championship</h1>
    

<p><a href="../../../../../blog/2014/11/06/my-predictions-and-hopes-for-the-2014-carlsen-anand-world-chess-championship-rematch/">Last week I made some predictions</a> about the <a href="http://www.sochi2014.fide.com/">2014 Carlsen-Anand World Chess Championship</a> match before it began. Now, four rounds later, there have been two draws and a win for each player. What next? Since I correctly predicted some things already, I thought I&rsquo;d speculate about the next couple of rounds.</p>

<h2 id="anand">Anand</h2>

<h3 id="as-white">As White</h3>

<p>As I expected, Anand opened with d4 with a view to aggressive, sharp lines based on home preparation. In round 1, he lost his nerve and lost his initiative, but in round 3, he won convincingly, first inviting a Queen&rsquo;s Indian (as I expected he would) but then defeating the Queen&rsquo;s Gambit Declined. I do not see why he would vary from d4 as White in the future unless he ends up ahead in the match and has psychological reasons to mix things up.</p>

<h3 id="as-black">As Black</h3>

<p>So far, Anand has only faced 1 e4 as Black. In round 2, Anand made what seems like a stupid decision to try to go into the Berlin Defense, and got punished by a loss. I see no reason for him to play the Berlin Defense again; playing 1&hellip;e5 just seems to be playing into Carlsen&rsquo;s strengths. In round 4, Anand went for the Sicilian, as I expected; he used an &hellip;e6 move order to avoid the Moscow and Rossolimo, causing Carlsen to vary with a g3 anti-Sicilian, resulting in a draw. My suspicion is still that Anand might be aiming for a &hellip;Nc6 Sicilian through transposition, perhaps a Taimanov. I expect him to try this again.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m most curious about how Anand would face the English. I think it would depend on his situation. 1&hellip;e5 would be an ambitious, unbalancing choice, while transposition to a Slav structure is also possible.</p>

<h2 id="carlsen">Carlsen</h2>

<h3 id="as-white-1">As White</h3>

<p>I made no specific prediction about how Carlsen would open as White. He has played 1 e4 twice, once with success but once leading to a draw. Psychologically, his inability or unwillingness to engage Anand in an Open Sicilian does not make continuing with 1 e4 right now seem plausible. I expect him to vary, possibly using the English. I certainly hope he doesn&rsquo;t try the Reti again as he did last year, even though it worked then; he is facing a different Anand this year.</p>

<h3 id="as-black-1">As Black</h3>

<p>The Grünfeld in round 1 was a surprise, but exactly true to my expectation that &ldquo;he will do whatever might confuse Anand&rdquo;. That he varied in round 3 with the Queen&rsquo;s Gambit Declined suggests that the Grünfeld may not appear again soon, but he lost with the Queen&rsquo;s Gambit Declined, so will he play it again? It is possible. Another possibility is to resort to the Queen&rsquo;s Indian, making sure to avoid sacrificial lines (which means possibly playing a traditional &hellip;Bb7 instead of &hellip;Ba6). Or he could play a Ragozin.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Right now I think Anand is actually in good shape in the match, having a certain momentum. It appears Carlsen is mainly winging it, in the last two rounds. I expect him to change things up.</p>
