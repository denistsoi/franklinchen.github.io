    <h1>Report on my second day of Stoic Week 2014: mindfulness</h1>
    

<p>Yesterday, I reported on my <a href="../../../../../blog/2014/11/24/report-on-my-first-day-of-stoic-week-2014/">first day of Stoic Week 2014</a>. Today, the second day&rsquo;s theme was &ldquo;Stoic mindfulness&rdquo;. This is similar to the Buddhist teaching on mindfulness, and is basically a sound psychological observation that &ldquo;You are just an impression and not at all the thing you claim to represent&rdquo;: our thoughts and feelings are one thing but what we do about them is another.</p>

<p>I found it particularly useful to remember this today, because Tuesdays present an interesting challenge for me.</p>

<h2 id="chess">Chess</h2>

<p>On Tuesday nights, I have been playing in the latest 6-round current Tuesday night <a href="http://pittsburghcc.org/">Pittsburgh Chess Club</a> tournament, one round every Tuesday. Tonight was round 4. I had experienced an extremely painful loss last week in round 3 when I was <em>not mindful</em> and <a href="http://chessimprover.com/blockading-to-defend-when-things-get-tough/">got carried away by emotions</a>: I had an overwhelming advantage during an attack on my opponent&rsquo;s King, but I allowed my excitement to cloud my judgment, make poor moves, and then worse, after I managed to recover and had the opportunity to survive with a draw, <em>and saw this</em>, I passed it up out of wishful thinking that I could continue an attack, so I ended up losing. In chess, I face the stark reality that most losses at my level in local competition (where I am typically the top-rated player) are due to faulty psychology, rather than lack of sufficient understanding and skill. A loss of <em>objectivity</em> (which all athletes and other performers under high pressure) is the reason we fail. Mindfulness directly addresses this all-too-human flaw.</p>

<h2 id="continuing-habits-from-yesterday">Continuing habits from yesterday</h2>

<p>Yesterday, I noted that I began meditating and exercising again, because it was in my power to do so. I have continued. It&rsquo;s been tricky to get going again, because my body is out of whack, but I remember to do what I can, no more, with faith that incremental progress will pay off. Instead of running, I did a <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/projects/workouts/">7-minute workout</a>. I&rsquo;ve lost a lot of strength over the years and plan to regain it. I have dumbbells lying around the house from when I was using them a decade ago; it&rsquo;s time to get back to them.</p>

<h2 id="tonight-s-chess-game">Tonight&rsquo;s chess game</h2>

<p>I won a decent game tonight at the chess tournament. It was the third last to finish, taking almost four hours. I&rsquo;ve played against my opponent many times before over the years, mostly winning, but the last time I played him, he held me to a draw, despite a 500-rating-point difference (which is huge). One thing that sometimes happens in tournament chess is overconfidence when facing someone who is on paper much weaker, or fear because of a past bad result. Mindfulness teaches us that although historical facts are facts, we should distance ourselves from distracting feelings about them.</p>

<p>As in many hard-fought chess games, I experienced a range of emotions during the game. First of all, in the opening, although I was doing OK, I was frustrated that I allowed a certain kind of position I ordinarily do not allow, because of an oversight. Instead of kicking myself, I focused to do what I could with what I had, assessing that even though I did not want that position, it was actually still OK for me. (Actually, computer analysis afterwards showed that I was more than OK, so I was still more pessimistic than warranted during the game.) In the middlegame, I emerged with an advantage, but then faced a curious choice. My opponent gave me an opportunity to win some material (a Rook for a Bishop and Pawn) at the expense of destroying my Pawn structure and therefore creating good chances for a draw. At the time, I saw no better winning try, so I went for it, deciding that, unlike last week, I was going to settle for a draw if my opponent could prove he could defend; I simply made sure to play soundly and not recklessly. It turned out that he cracked eventually and I won. I was pleased that I remained psychologically strong in the game and was rewarded accordingly. (For those of you interested in the technical details of the game, I will be annotating it in an upcoming article I will write for <a href="http://chessimprover.com/category/franklin-chen/">my weekly column in The Chess Improver</a>.</p>

<h2 id="heavy-traffic">Heavy traffic</h2>

<p>Another thing: when driving home from work to eat dinner before the chess game, I noticed that the traffic was unusually bad. Mindfulness is always helpful when facing stressful situations like this. I was upset with myself for not anticipating apparent pre-Thanksgiving-holiday traffic and therefore being pressed for time to get home and eat dinner before playing chess. I decided to let go of my self-annoyance because it wasn&rsquo;t going to help me get home any sooner and would just sap my mental energy I needed for my game.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Mindfulness is something I&rsquo;ve had prior experience in trying to adopt well before I even read about Stoicism. But having a daily theme and reading during Stoic Week has been surprisingly helpful in keeping me aware.</p>

<p><strong>Are you familiar with the concept of mindfulness and the scientific underpinnings of it? If so, do you deliberately practice it? Do you have misgivings about it?</strong></p>
