    <h1>On re-experiencing VHS tapes again</h1>
    

<p>I stopped serious study of ballroom dance sometime around 2003, over ten years ago, because I was discouraged by not finding a maximally compatible dance partner. I ended up closing the chapter of my life that started in 2000 when ballroom dance consumed almost all of my time.</p>

<p>Recently I brought up several boxes of ballroom dance instruction videos from those days, with the idea that even though I&rsquo;m not longer doing ballroom dancing with anyone any more (Abby is not very interested in ballroom dance), I might find it enjoyable to continue developing my dance skills and use the videos as part of exercise also. Almost all of these videos are VHS tapes. I have almost no dance videos on DVD, as I was very late in acquiring a DVD player: actually, one day, my mother bought me a DVD player because she was tired of visiting me and having no way to watching any DVDs she brought!</p>

<p>I had mixed emotions and memories as I started going through these videos again.</p>

<h2 id="why-was-i-late-to-cds-and-dvds">Why was I late to CDs and DVDs?</h2>

<p>Earlier in life, I was very late in getting a CD player also; I bought only <a href="../../../../../blog/2013/09/12/rip-ray-dolby-yes/">cassette tapes</a> and LPs until late in college, around 1990, when I finally buckled to pressure and bought a CD player. I am generally not an early adopter of technology. I <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/03/22/paradox-i-will-observe-the-national-day-of-unplugging-but-just-bought-my-first-smartphone-this-week/">bought my first smartphone in 2012</a>.</p>

<p>Why the resistance to technology? Partly it&rsquo;s just a matter of cost. But more fundamentally, I worried about the long-term durability of digital media. It turns out that I shouldn&rsquo;t have worried quite so much, because backing up has turned out to be quite feasible and inexpensive. But in the early days of CDs and DVDs, I was not going to be ripping them and storing them on super-expensive hard drives, so my worry was about the physical media of CDs and DVDs.</p>

<h2 id="was-i-was-right-about-the-disadvantages-of-digital-media">Was I was right about the disadvantages of digital media?</h2>

<p>It turns out that I was partially right. Some of my old CDs and DVDs did become unplayable after a decade or two, but very few.</p>

<p>The bigger problem is that Abby and I sometimes check out DVDs from the public library and find that they have enough scratches that when watching a film we often miss entire minutes and scenes because of damaged playback! This has happened so many times that I question the value of ever checking out a DVD from the library again that looks even a little scratched. What a waste!</p>

<p>The advantage of analog media such as LPs and cassette tapes and VHS tapes is that in some ways they are more fault tolerant. I remember the old days of splicing tape, for example.</p>

<p>But actually, analog media get corrupted easily enough by magnetism, mold, etc. I do have tapes that are unplayable.</p>

<p>The killer feature of digital media was always indexing and random access. It&rsquo;s a real hassle not being able to skip from one dance lesson to the next, or get a table of contents, in these dance videos.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s far less efficient using VHS videos for instruction than indexed digital media. That said, I see why people stream video these days rather than buy or borrow DVDs; physical digital media are fragile. But what would libraries do if they stopped acquiring and serving CDs and DVDs?</p>
