    <h1>Thoughts upon uninstalling &#34;Temple Run 2&#34; from my phone</h1>
    

<p>I have a confession to make.</p>

<p>Two years ago, when I finally got my first <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/03/22/paradox-i-will-observe-the-national-day-of-unplugging-but-just-bought-my-first-smartphone-this-week/">smartphone</a>, I downloaded a free game, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Run">Temple Run</a>, and quickly became a bit obsessed with it.</p>

<p>This was the first computer game I had played in <em>twenty years</em>, actually; although in college I played a fair number of games (including actual physical arcade games in the basement of the college dining hall), including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Castle">Dark Castle</a>, which I commandeered friends&rsquo; Macs to play (I owned only an Apple IIe in college, for word processing purposes), the last time I played computer games was in grad school twenty years ago, when I conquered a Mac game called &ldquo;Kung Fu Chivalry&rdquo;. Somehow, after actually winning that game, I totally lost interest in playing computer games again (despite being annoyed about never finishing &ldquo;Beyond Dark Castle&rdquo;).</p>

<p>I noticed that my reaction time and coordination were quite rusty after twenty years away from this kind of game, and was determined to get good at Temple Run. I was really bad for a while, but then everything started falling into place, and I got good enough that I got a bit bored. I forgot about the game for a long time.</p>

<p>Months later, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Run_2">Temple Run 2</a> came out, and I got that, and deleted the original Temple Run. The graphics were much better and the action was more interesting, but again, I got good enough that I got bored. Eventually I stopped playing the game. It&rsquo;s probably been almost a year since I last played it, actually.</p>

<p>But I still had it on my phone, just in case I got &ldquo;bored&rdquo; or wanted to check up on my reaction time to see if I had retained my improvements. I never did end up playing it again though. Finally, I just deleted it, to free up space on my phone and to commit to saying goodbye to the game.</p>

<p>Thoughts flashed through my mind as I deleted the game.</p>

<h2 id="we-are-always-choosing-how-to-spend-our-time-we-must-own-our-choices">We are always choosing how to spend our time; we must own our choices</h2>

<p>I felt guilty every time I played the game on the phone (or the iPad, on which I had also installed the game, but I didn&rsquo;t play it often on that). Part of me thought it was a waste of time. Part of me rationalized that I was &ldquo;training&rdquo; my brain and fingers to improve my overall reaction time and motor coordination.</p>

<p><em>I don&rsquo;t like feeling guilty about anything</em>. I&rsquo;d rather just <em>do</em> the thing in all good conscience, or <em>not do</em> it at all. At some point, I resolved the dissonance for good by no longer playing the game.</p>

<h2 id="i-noticed-how-i-had-let-the-smartphone-intrude-on-my-life">I noticed how I had let the smartphone intrude on my life</h2>

<p>Obviously, upon getting my first smartphone, I was excited by all the things I could do that I couldn&rsquo;t do before. I could check my email anywhere, read my RSS feeds, Facebook, etc. I even loaded up some of my books onto the phone.</p>

<p>I found myself pulling out the phone to play the game when I was &ldquo;bored&rdquo; while riding in a car or something. Then I realized that I was missing the scenery, or just plain quiet time away from technology. Eventually, I decided to minimize the use of my phone when away from home or work, where I&rsquo;m already in front of a computer most of the time already anyway. Yes, I can spend several hours without checking my phone for email (especially if I&rsquo;m in the middle of nowhere with no reception).</p>

<h2 id="i-got-sucked-in-by-fear-of-losing-my-accumulated-wealth">I got sucked in by fear of losing my accumulated &ldquo;wealth&rdquo;</h2>

<p>I took so long to delete the game because I kept thinking that if I ever wanted to keep playing, I had racked up a lot of points and &ldquo;unlocked&rdquo; various powers, so I wanted to keep all that &ldquo;just in case&rdquo;. So keeping the game wasn&rsquo;t even really about my enjoyment of it any more; I just liked the &ldquo;wealth&rdquo; I had accumulated. I was hoarding what was really worthless. The only thing I could do with my unlocked powers was continue playing the game to earn more powers.</p>

<h2 id="what-was-once-fun-and-useful-may-become-stale">What was once fun and useful may become stale</h2>

<p>I still believe that it was worth spending some time playing the game. It really did improve my mental functioning to a degree. But there were no further benefits to be gained. It is worth periodically evaluating whether old activities or habits are still doing us any good, even if they once did.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I had my fun with Temple Run, learned some things about myself along the way, and now am done.</p>

<p><strong>How do you feel when you uninstall a favorite game or app, or declutter in some other way? Do you feel sadness? Relief? Regret? Pride?</strong></p>
