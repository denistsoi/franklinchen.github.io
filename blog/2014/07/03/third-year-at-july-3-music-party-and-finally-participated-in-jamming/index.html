    <h1>Third year at July 3 music party and finally participated in jamming</h1>
    

<p>The past two years, Abby and I have gone to an annual July 3 music potluck/party, and we went again this year. Both <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/07/03/petrified-at-a-music-jam-session-so-i-didnt-play-but-watched-and-listened/">in 2012</a> as well as <a href="../../../../../blog/2013/07/03/second-year-at-july-3-music-party-still-only-listening-without-playing/">in 2013</a>, I was too intimidated to participate in music jamming, and only watched. This year I was determined to contribute, and I brought my ukulele (which I only started learning <a href="../../../../../blog/2013/08/23/another-unexpected-life-change-one-month-of-learning-to-play-ukulele/">a month after last year&rsquo;s party</a>, actually) and my Irish flute.</p>

<h2 id="piano">Piano</h2>

<p>After my first round of food at the potluck, I went to Susan&rsquo;s piano and played David Raksin&rsquo;s theme from &ldquo;Laura&rdquo;, which I had so botched up last month at the annual Pittsburgh Recorder Society potluck/recital. I play it much better now, although I somehow messed up the final chords today. There were a few people sitting around listening, and they wanted to hear more, but I didn&rsquo;t have any more, so I scurried away to eat more food.</p>

<h2 id="old-time">Old time</h2>

<p>As dinner started winding down, the old time musicians started gathering outside to play. I saw fiddles, banjos, and other instruments make an appearance.</p>

<h2 id="blues">Blues</h2>

<p>Inside, the main guy who plays guitar and ukulele unpacked his soprano ukulele, and so I took out my concert ukulele, and two other guys with guitars appeared. Eventually a woman who sang also appeared, as well as a guy on fiddle.</p>

<p>I felt very intimidated, because although I&rsquo;ve gotten some experience jamming while on recorder or flute or tin whistle, my ukulele experience <em>without written music</em> is still very minimal. Nevertheless, I joined in. I fumbled around, and had to ask what key each song was being played in, and even then, I&rsquo;m still quite shaky in anticipating and knowing chord changes beyond the simplest I, IV, V, and some dominant and major 7th chords. I strummed very softly.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re a great bunch, improvising melodic lines at will and even making up lyrics right on the spot, just as they had at the last two years when I only watched. And the singing in harmony was fantastic.</p>

<p>Abby got a little bit of video footage of us at one point:</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>For two years, I was afraid to join in the music jams at this annual July 3 party. This year I joined in a little bit. If we attend the party again next year, I hope to be in a position to contribute even more! Many thanks to Susan for hosting this annual party!</p>
