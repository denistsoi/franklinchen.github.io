    <h1>Happiness Is: Finishing 39th of 43 Men in a Race!</h1>
    

<p>Yesterday, on a late, muggy afternoon, I ran in a race, and finished 39th of 43 men in the race. I ran as hard as I could, just as I do in every race: my goal is always to run fast and beat as many competitors as I can. I don&rsquo;t run in a race for &ldquo;fun&rdquo; (in the conventional sense of the word): I race to know pain and to stretch my limits. (I save my &ldquo;fun&rdquo; running for when I&rsquo;m not racing.)</p>

<p>So why was I pretty happy, despite getting my butt totally kicked?</p>

<p>For amusement, here is an excerpt of the men&rsquo;s individual results of the <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/athletics/recreation/intramurals/activities.html">CMU intramural</a> XC race yesterday (billed as 2 miles but the course was clearly shorter than that): <ol start="38">
  <li>13:17.3</li>
  <li>13:27.7 (me)</li>
  <li>14:33.7</li>
  <li>14:33.71</li>
  <li>14:33.72</li>
  <li>14:59.9</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Well, I was happy for a number of reasons.</p>

<p>For one thing, this is the first &ldquo;cross-country&rdquo; race I have done, so I was just plain excited to do something different.</p>

<p>Also, my expectations were low. <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice.html"><em>Low expectations are the secret to happiness.</em></a> I entered the race knowing there was a definite possibility that I would finish last. I knew many of the runners would be undergrads less than half my age, and a self-selected group too, a group that does not include the (sadly numerous) students I see around every day who take the bus down one or two blocks or take the elevator up one floor.</p>

<p><em>I was one of those students once</em>. I was not a runner as a child, or in high school, or in college, or even in graduate school. I was sickly as a child, and also I was raised to pay no attention to physical fitness and even to look down on those who were fit (I know, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sour_grapes">sour grapes</a>). I started running only after I left graduate school and embarked on several radical life changes (including losing 30 pounds, altering my diet, and taking up competitive ballroom dancing). So in a way, taking advantage of the opportunity (as CMU staff) to take part in the CMU intramural cross-country race was a way to fill in a gap in my collection of novel and exciting lifetime experiences.</p>

<p>You can bet I&rsquo;ll be running this race again next year, and with every intention of placing higher.</p>

<p>It turned out that <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/09/27/why-i-missed-the-cmu-intramural-xc-race-this-year/">I ended up not running this race in 2012</a>.</p>

<h2 id="a-note-on-shoes">A note on shoes</h2>

<p>I ran yesterday&rsquo;s race in my <a href="http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/products/Five-Fingers-BikilaLS-Mens.htm">Vibram FiveFingers Bikila LS shoes</a>, the first time I&rsquo;d worn this pair of shoes in a race. I will run the Great Race in these shoes also. (More later on this blog about &ldquo;minimalist shoes&rdquo; and how they saved my life.)</p>

<h2 id="preview-for-sunday">Preview for Sunday</h2>

<p>On Sunday I will be running the <a href="http://www.rungreatrace.com/">Pittsburgh Great Race 10K</a>. This will be the ninth time I have run the race. Stay tuned for a race report on Sunday!</p>

<p>Below is a photo of my running it for the first time, in 2000, as the second race I had ever done (and I had never run more than three miles continuously in my life at that time). It was quite an ordeal. The following year I ran the race better prepared, 8:51 faster.</p>
