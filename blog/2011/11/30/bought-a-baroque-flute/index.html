    <h1>Bought a Baroque flute</h1>

<p>I got a <a href="http://www.oldflutes.com/baroq.htm">Baroque flute</a> today. The one I got was the plastic Aulos, since it is by far less expensive than any wooden one, and recommended by a number of people I know. Also, it was the A440-tuned one, rather than the A415-tuned one, since I want to be able to play it with people on modern instruments.</p>

<p>Why did I suddenly get this instrument, when less than two weeks ago, when discussing <a href="../../../../../blog/2011/11/17/flute-versus-recorder/">my recent return to the modern flute</a>, I explained all the reasons I didn&rsquo;t expect to try Baroque flute anytime soon?</p>

<h2 id="why-now">Why now?</h2>

<p>It turned out that I got more information than I had then. For one thing, when I announced to everyone at the last meeting of the local <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/lukas/pcars/Welcome.html">Pittsburgh chapter of the American Recorder Society</a> that I was playing the modern flute again, of course they said, &ldquo;How about trying the Baroque flute?&rdquo; and told me about the affordable plastic one. Also, finding out that I could get an A440-tuned instrument mattered a lot. I don&rsquo;t want to invest anytime soon in an instrument that I can&rsquo;t play in a wide range of circumstances.</p>

<p>Finally, by chance it turned out that Abby needed to buy some musical supplies from a place that had the precise Aulos Baroque flute I was looking at (and the lowest price online), and so we added it to the order to get a discount all in one order.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t think it was important to mention at the time, but when I wrote this blog post, I had just <em>two weeks earlier</em> checked out of the library, by sheer accident since it was on display, a book/CD set called <a href="http://www.boosey.com/shop/prod/Various-English-Airs-and-Dances-Baroque-Around-the-World-series-Book-CD/918892">&ldquo;English Airs and Dances&rdquo;</a>, from a <a href="http://www.boosey.com/shop/prod/Various-English-Airs-and-Dances-Baroque-Around-the-World-series-Book-CD/918892">&ldquo;Baroque Around the World&rdquo; series</a>, and begun working on playing the music in it, on modern flute.</p>

<h2 id="what-now">What now?</h2>

<p>Well, I picked up <a href="http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520214477">Boland&rsquo;s &ldquo;Method for the One-Keyed Flute&rdquo;</a> from the library, and it looks very good. At some point I&rsquo;ll start working on it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also pretty enchanted with the modern flute these days, and have been working hard to improve rapidly and considerably on it, with some hope of playing it when I see my sister later this month.</p>

<h2 id="other-flutes">Other flutes?</h2>

<p>It turns out that on Thanksgiving, I saw at the host&rsquo;s place some tubes with holes that I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to make a sound on. I was told they were plastic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaval">kavals</a>. I had certainly heard and seen such instruments being played many times before, but not looked at them up front. With some guidance, I spent a large amount of time trying to make sounds on the kavals, and only partially succeeding.</p>

<p>I guess now now that I have increasing experience with flute-type instruments, I am finding variations on the concept kind of fascinating. I might want to try figuring out the kaval at some point.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to own a relatively inexpensive Baroque flute to play around with. I have to be careful, since I am attracted to novelty and variety but need to discipline myself in order to excel at a smaller number of endeavors, rather than be a mere dilettante at a larger number.</p>
