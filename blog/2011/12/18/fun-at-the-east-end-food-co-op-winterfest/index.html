    <h1>Fun at the East End Food Co-op Winterfest</h1>
    

<p>Saturday, Abby and I went to the annual <a href="http://eastendfoodcoop.com/">East End Food Co-op</a> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/144638855639374/">Winterfest</a> with John, as we did last year, and were joined by Mark, Jin, and their daughter Julia.</p>

<p>This family-friendly annual event serves as a fund raiser, and features a variety of vegetarian and vegan food as well as live music. This year, the draw was <a href="http://davidshelow.com/guitar/performance/ensemble.php">Bury the Cabbage</a>, a group playing Irish traditional music.</p>

<p>Every year, I&rsquo;ve bumped into a good number of people here that I haven&rsquo;t seen for a while, and this year was no exception.</p>

<h2 id="young-children">Young children</h2>

<p>The little kids quickly and spontaneously found one another other and started running around and playing, so Julia had her fun. They all seemed to like the balloon man.</p>

<h2 id="food">Food</h2>

<p>There was plenty of food available at the Winterfest. It was all vegetarian and vegan. I stuffed myself silly, especially enjoying the roasted peppers, eggplant, zucchini, and sweet potato pancakes. There was pasta with tofu, falafel, mushroom, salad, fruit, and other selection. I sampled them all.</p>

<p>There was a wide selection of cookies, carefully classified. Some were vegan, others were gluten-free. There were too many varieties for me to even try one of each.</p>

<h2 id="people-in-pittsburgh">People in Pittsburgh</h2>

<p>Abby and I recognized one person in the Irish band, <a href="http://www.lesgetchell.com/">Les</a>. We had met him at a party at one point but not known much about him. It&rsquo;s funny how in Pittsburgh it is easy to run into the same person in different contexts!</p>

<p>We saw <a href="http://www.cleanlink.com/sm/article/Endurance-Running-Takes-Will-Desire--550">Sam Bertenthal</a> again with his son Fernando. Sam is a local ultrarunner whom I first met in <a href="../../../../../images/franklin-finishing-sammys-birthday-run-2006.jpg">2006</a> when I ran in his annual <a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/community/forums/runner-communities/masters/sammys-6-hour-birthday-run-race-report-new-twists?plckFindPostKey=Cat:Runner%20CommunitiesForum:648106477Discussion:926106577Post:836106577">Sammy&rsquo;s Birthday Run</a> for the first time. I ran just 27.5 miles that year (long enough to go beyond the marathon distance of 26.2 for my own pride), and went back to do the same in <a href="../../../../../images/franklin-finishing-sammys-birthday-run-2008.jpg">2008</a>.</p>

<p>Sam said hello and reminded me that next year he will be holding his race on July 14. We&rsquo;ll see whether I&rsquo;m up for it again. I haven&rsquo;t been running long distances in recent years.</p>

<p>We also saw some other people we recognized as regulars to the Winterfest, such as Linda of <a href="http://www.salsaritmodance.org/">Salsa Ritmo</a>, a salsa dance instructor through whom Abby and I actually first got together at a party of hers (and Linda&rsquo;s dance partner is Mark Fuhs, who was my classmate at CMU when I got him into ballroom dancing, then he discovered salsa and got serious about it and became an instructor).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.myspace.com/kimberleefaught">Kimberlee Faught</a> is a regular at the annual Winterfest also. If you live in the city of Pittsburgh, you&rsquo;ve probably seen her around playing violin in Squirrel Hill on Murray or Forbes (or elsewhere) when the weather is nice. I bump into her running in 5K races also!</p>

<p>I mention all this only because I really want to highlight how much I love that in Pittsburgh, I never feel alone. Wherever I go, I&rsquo;ll run into someone I know or have met from somewhere. This feel is very important to me.</p>

<h2 id="music-and-dancing">Music and dancing</h2>

<p>We enjoyed listening to the music, and Abby and I got up to dance a couple of waltzes (last year . There were some people who attempted to do Irish step dancing. Unfortunately, Abby and I don&rsquo;t know it, so we didn&rsquo;t try it. Maybe that&rsquo;s something else worth learning!</p>

<p>Sorry, no videos this year of Abby and me dancing! Last year John did get video of us <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKWXpkHF20g">dancing waltz to Zydeco Dogz</a>.</p>

<p>I noticed that <a href="http://brucefoley.com/">Bruce Foley</a> of Bury the Cabbage was playing what looked like an oversized tin whistle, so during a break I asked him about the instrument. Indeed, it was a whistle in D an octave lower than the little tin whistle I had started playing. He said the best place to get these whistles is <a href="http://www.burkewhistles.com/">Burke</a>. I have to confess I&rsquo;m not currently in the market for a low whistle, much less any professional-grade whistle.</p>

<h2 id="interviews-about-the-east-end-food-co-op-updated-2012-12-04">Interviews about the East End Food Co-op (updated 2012-12-04)</h2>

<p>At the party, there was a call for volunteers to be interviewed about the East End Food Co-op, how they use it, and what it means to them. Here&rsquo;s a video that was made from the interviews.</p>

<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/37628327?badge=0" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/37628327">Winterfest with the East End Food Co-op</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user10547223">East End Food Co-op</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>It was getting to be bedtime for Julia, so Mark and Jin prepared to go home, and John, Abby, and I also packed up (we were all told to take leftover food, of which there was plenty) and went home.</p>

<p>With filling our bellies, hearing a variety of music on different instruments and, dancing, hanging out with friends, people-watching, it was a fun evening.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the East End Food Co-op for organizing this annual event and providing the food, and the Jewish Community Center for hosting its location again. I am grateful that Mark, Jin, Julia, and John were able to join Abby and me for the evening. I am grateful for the opportunity to listen to excellent live music and dance to it.</p>
