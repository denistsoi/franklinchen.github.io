    <h1>Revisiting Knuth and McIlroy&#39;s word count programs</h1>
    

<p>Today I came across a <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2011/12/more-shell-less-egg/">blog post</a> revisiting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Bentley">Jon Bentley</a>&rsquo;s challenge in 1986 to <a href="http://www-cs-staff.stanford.edu/~uno/">Donald Knuth</a> to write a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate program</a> to solve a sample task and have <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/">Doug McIlroy</a> critique it.</p>

<p>The task:</p>

<blockquote>
Read a file of text, determine the n most frequently used words, and print out a sorted list of those words along with their frequencies.
</blockquote>

<p>Knuth came up with a typically clever, lengthy, low-level implementation. McIlroy then somewhat perversely wrote a six-line shell script that did the job, basically changing the subject away from literate programming and toward a <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~hos/mike/transcripts/mcilroy.htm">critique of Knuth&rsquo;s doing something low-level and complicated when unnecessary</a>. The article publishing both Knuth&rsquo;s and McIlroy&rsquo;s solutions is <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=315654">available here</a>. A followup article with David Hanson&rsquo;s implementation in C is <a href="http://www.cs.upc.edu/~eipec/pdf/p583-van_wyk.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>I decided to bring the discussion here a quarter of a century (25 years!) to the present. How would we solve the problem now?</p>

<h2 id="update-of-2013-06-29">(Update of 2013-06-29)</h2>

<p>I have changed my mind about many things I said here, and also have more clarifications and new arguments to make, which I will eventually post on my new programming blog, <a href="http://ConscientiousProgrammer.com/">The Conscientious Programmer</a>.</p>

<h2 id="salient-points-of-mcilroy-s-solution">Salient points of McIlroy&rsquo;s solution</h2>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s look at McIlroy&rsquo;s solution, which despite the passing of time is still a beautifully elegant illustration of why <a href="../../../../../blog/2011/10/13/why-dennis-ritchie-is-important/">Unix is timeless</a>. (By the way, <a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1193856">Knuth is a C and Linux user to this day</a>).</p>

<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span>tr -cs A-Za-z <span style="color: #BA2121">&#39;\n&#39;</span> |
tr A-Z a-z |
sort |
uniq -c |
sort -rn |
sed <span style="color: #BB6688; font-weight: bold">${</span><span style="color: #19177C">1</span><span style="color: #BB6688; font-weight: bold">}</span>q
</pre></div>


<p>The code is self-explanatory if you are familiar with basic Unix command-line tools. The pipeline just transforms data starting from standard input until the desired result is computed.</p>

<p>What is beautiful about the code is that it decomposes the solution to intuitively and does not require any mutable state. McIlroy&rsquo;s program is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional">purely functional</a> program.</p>

<h2 id="using-a-general-purpose-programming-language-instead">Using a general-purpose programming language instead</h2>

<p>I thought to myself, how would I write the program today? Especially if I thought I would need to modify it, add new features? The shell script does the job for the problem as stated, but would clearly be hard to extend. Indeed, historically, &ldquo;scripting languages&rdquo; such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK">Awk</a> were invented in order to do more than simple shell scripts were suitable for, and <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> was Larry Wall&rsquo;s response to Awk, to create a truly general-purpose language.</p>

<p>Nowadays, in 2011, languages and libraries are at a sufficiently high level that a program almost as concise as McIlroy&rsquo;s could be written in Perl, Ruby, Python, or even the latest versions of Java, C#, etc. I&rsquo;ll leave that as an exercise for you (feel free to post your solutions as comments below).</p>

<h3 id="haskell">Haskell</h3>

<p>I present a simple program in <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> that I feel is closest to McIlroy&rsquo;s both in spirit and in letter.</p>

<p>Here is my Haskell program, in two variants. The first is a standard source code file, while the second uses Haskell&rsquo;s built-in support for its own notion of &ldquo;literate programming&rdquo;.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1448622.js"></script>


<p>I used <a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/">GHC</a> to compile and run the program.  Sample output:</p>

<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span><span style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold">$</span> ghc -O6 --make WordCount
<span style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold">$</span> ./WordCount <span style="color: #666666">10</span> &lt; WordCount.lhs
<span style="color: #888888">35 the</span>
<span style="color: #888888">16 a</span>
<span style="color: #888888">11 list</span>
<span style="color: #888888">10 of</span>
<span style="color: #888888">9 text</span>
<span style="color: #888888">9 for</span>
<span style="color: #888888">8 n</span>
<span style="color: #888888">8 map</span>
<span style="color: #888888">8 count</span>
<span style="color: #888888">7 string</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Apart from missing leading spaces, this is the same output as from McIlroy&rsquo;s shell script.</p>

<p>The literate program above explains each step of the Haskell &ldquo;pipeline&rdquo; I constructed.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-don-t-do-literate-programming">Why I don&rsquo;t do literate programming</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t currently use &ldquo;literate programming&rdquo; systems.</p>

<p>I experimented with programming in C and C++ and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML">Standard ML</a> using <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb/">noweb</a> over a decade ago, but found that for myself, it was not really beneficial.</p>

<p>There was little benefit in being able to rearrange code fragments at will. Furthermore, spreading code out interspersed with a lot of prose made it harder for me to actually <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)">chunk</a> meaning out of a spatial portion of text in my editor window.</p>

<p>Also, modern languages and programming styles make it much easier to express things concisely and less monolithically, such that I find that using ordinary comments suffices for my needs.</p>

<p>I find that literate programming in the Knuth style amounts to a macro system that distorts the layout of code.</p>

<p>Finally, literate programming interacts badly with editors and IDEs that are built specifically to operate on pure source code.</p>

<p>What do you think? Which of the variants of the same Haskell code above would you prefer to write, read, or maintain? The non-literate one or the literate one?</p>

<h2 id="an-alternative-to-literate-programming">An alternative to literate programming</h2>

<p>I should note that in practice, I would write suitable comments in a non-literate program primarily before the function definition. Also, I would not use such a large pipeline of expressions either: I would break out almost every line of the pipeline into its own little function, with its own comment. That is how I would actually write a nontrivial Haskell program, writing one or two line functions and testing each of them, before trying to hook them all up into a big pipeline.</p>

<p>I &ldquo;cheated&rdquo; in this case because McIlroy&rsquo;s program already existed, so I simply translated it into a Haskell equivalent without real thought and testing.</p>

<h2 id="comparison-between-the-shell-script-and-the-haskell-program">Comparison between the shell script and the Haskell program</h2>

<p>The shell script operates on raw text and everything is just strings being parsed and reparsed by the respective Unix utility programs.</p>

<p>The Haskell program is <em>statically typed</em>. It is type-checked by the compiler, which generates native code. The program uses standard libraries and data types, such as lists and hash maps.</p>

<p>Also, the Haskell program could be refined, extended, optimized in various ways. The most important optimizations I can think of off the top of my head:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using a better representation of strings than the default built-in &ldquo;string as list of characters&rdquo;. Easily accessible advice can be found on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/576213/efficient-string-implementation-in-haskell">Stack Overflow</a> and browsing through Haskell library documentation, such as for the <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/text">text</a> package.</li>
<li>Loop fusion, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation_(computer_science)">deforestation</a> can be applied to deal with the <em>apparent</em> allocation of lots of new lists in the pipeline. One of the selling points of using a language like Haskell is the opportunity for the compiler to perform radical optimizations that are impossible for languages that have side effects.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don&rsquo;t write many <code>bash</code> scripts these days. General-purpose programming languages can do a decent job munging data without difficulty. The situation was different decades ago when there was C, and few standard high-level libraries for the C world.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<ul>
<li>I am skeptical of literate programming.</li>
<li>McIlroy was ahead of his time, but that time has passed; we should take his contributions as inspiration to move further forward already, using advanced general-purpose programming languages.</li>
</ul>
