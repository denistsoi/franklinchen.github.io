    <h1>Communicating Through Dialogue</h1>
    

<p>Today I attended a <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/hr/learning/">&ldquo;Learning and Development&rdquo; seminar at CMU</a> that I had signed up for several weeks ago. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed attending many of these seminars in the past years. The one I attended today was &ldquo;Communicating Through Dialogue&rdquo;, by Ron Placone (many of whose seminars on other topics I&rsquo;ve attended).</p>

<p>By sheer coincidence, this seminar, which I had registered for just out of curiosity long ago, was just what I needed at this very moment in my life!</p>

<p>It turns out that right now, there is a situation in which I need to know how to communicate well to work effectively with someone toward a common goal. Our collaboration in the past has left something to be desired, and this time we want to move forward in a clear way. We are going to talk on Thursday.</p>

<h2 id="dialogue">Dialogue</h2>

<p>In the seminar, I learned that a fundamental barrier in effective communication is taking a &ldquo;debate&rdquo; attitude, in which we not only believe we are absolutely right, but also try to force the other side to adopt our point of view and implement it; the entire goal of anything that we say is to put forth arguments, probe for weaknesses, and try to win.</p>

<p>We all know this combative attitude can lead to defensiveness and deadlock, yet it is a very obvious way in which we often function. Is there a different way?</p>

<p>Apparently, some people in the business world have created a whole discipline devoted to something specifically called &ldquo;dialogue&rdquo;. &ldquo;Dialogue&rdquo; differs from &ldquo;discussion&rdquo; in that &ldquo;discussion&rdquo; has the intentions of telling, persuading, and figuring out who is right and settling on that, while &ldquo;dialogue&rdquo; has the intentions of learning, discovering, and integrating perspectives. It is not aimed at immediately making a decision.</p>

<h2 id="sources">Sources</h2>

<p>In the seminar we received many handouts from various sources concerning this whole notion of &ldquo;dialogue&rdquo;. Curiously, I could find no comprehensive web site online from these sources. Our longest handout was printed off the web in 2005 (!) from a web site that no longer exists and was an excerpt from writings by Glenna Gerard and Linda Ellinor. I looked up these authors and found their book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dialogue-Rediscover-Transforming-Power-Conversation/dp/0471174661">&ldquo;Dialogue: Rediscover the Transforming Power of Conversation&rdquo;</a>, published in 1998 and now apparently out of print.  (By the way, thanks to the <a href="http://www.clpgh.org/usingthelibrary/technology/widgets/ff_plugins.html">Firefox plug-in for Amazon.com</a>, I was able to see that my <a href="../../../../../blog/2011/09/30/free-to-the-people-since-1895/">favorite library</a> has this book, so I clicked directly from the Amazon page to put it on hold!)</p>

<p>A web search for the text in the handout for &ldquo;the six basic rules of dialogue&rdquo; turned up this <a href="http://www.lelendinglibrary.com/news_dialoguearticle.aspx">page by Robert Rosell</a>. Here are the six rules in the handout and on that web site:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Be open and suspend judgment; don&rsquo;t disparage other points of view.</p></li>

<li><p>Keep dialogue and decision-making separate; dialogue precedes decision-making, negotiation or action.</p></li>

<li><p>Speak for yourself, not as a representative, and treat all participants as peers.</p></li>

<li><p>Listen with empathy; acknowledging you have heard others and that you care.</p></li>

<li><p>Look for common ground; identifying areas where you agree.</p></li>

<li><p>Search for and disclose hidden assumptions; especially in yourself.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="my-reaction">My reaction</h2>

<p>I have to confess that a lot of the material we received seemed very <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Age">New Agey</a>. Maybe that&rsquo;s why it seems no longer in vogue in the business world since first introduced, and I couldn&rsquo;t find a lot of prominent web search hits on the topic.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I don&rsquo;t discount something just because it&rsquo;s New Agey. I am totally an opportunist in my life. Over the years, I have cherry-picked ideas and techniques for everything in life from whatever sources, and if they work, I keep and use them, and if they don&rsquo;t, I just throw them away. (I&rsquo;ve thrown quite a few away.)</p>

<p>All I know is that just reflecting on the &ldquo;six basic rules of dialogue&rdquo;, and how easily I can break all six rules without even knowing it, I felt calmer and more ready to prepare for and be committed to a win-win dialogue for Thursday.</p>

<p>Thank you, Ron, for introducing me to this fascinating approach to communication!</p>
