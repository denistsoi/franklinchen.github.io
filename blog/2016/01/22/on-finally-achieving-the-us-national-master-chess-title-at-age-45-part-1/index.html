<p>On December 18, 2015, I finally achieved the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_title#Master">United States National Master</a>
chess title, at the relatively late age of 45 (I don&rsquo;t have
statistics, but I suspect the vast majority of chess players who reach
National Master do so in their teens and twenties). I plan to
eventually write about how I significantly improved my chess when I
returned after a twenty-year break to start playing again ten years
ago at age 35, and how I now teach and coach chess based on my
experience in self-improvement. I will also write more about how I
continue to work on self-improvement outside of chess.</p>

<p>For now, below is an interview that was published in the June 2016
issue of the
<a href="http://pittsburghcc.org/">Pittsburgh Chess Club</a> publication, &ldquo;En
Passant&rdquo;:</p>

<h2 id="when-did-you-learn-chess-how-old-were-you-who-taught-you-what-did-you-think-or-feel-during-that-first-experience">When did you learn chess? How old were you? Who taught you? What did you think or feel during that first experience?</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t actually remember a moment in my life when I didn&rsquo;t know the
basic rules of chess!</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I mean: my first life memories are from shortly before I
was 3 years old (I remember celebrating my 3rd birthday), when I was
already playing chess with my father. The story is that when I was 2
years old, the 1972 Fischer-Spassky match was happening and the result
was that during the summer of 1972, my father and his grad school
classmates decided to teach themselves chess. According to him, at
some point I watched and deduced some of the movements, and he noticed
my interest. I don&rsquo;t remember any of that, but I remember that at some
point he bought &ldquo;Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess&rdquo; (he may still have this
in his library) and he led me through it after he had finished it
himself. So that was my first chess book, and we did it before I was 4
years old, because life changed for me after my sister was born before
I turned 4, and my father no longer had much attention for me for a
while.</p>

<p>What I remember is simply the joy of seeing the geometry of the
different piece movements fitting together. I was also extremely
particular about setting up the board: I always wanted my Knights to
face each other, and I still am, and at the beginning of every game,
you will note that I always adjust my Knights accordingly.</p>

<h2 id="what-was-the-next-big-step-in-your-chess-life-as-a-child">What was the next big step in your chess life as a child?</h2>

<p>After my father finished graduate school, he was very busy finding
jobs, etc., and chess was put aside for a while, but finding chess
sets lying around in school led me to find in the libraries some chess
books written for children, and I enjoyed them very much. When I was
7, he found his first stable job in Morristown, New Jersey, so we
moved yet again. We discovered that the Morris County Free Library had
a huge chess book collection, and we started reading through it
together. In the process, we finally realized that we had gotten some
of the rules wrong when playing with each other at home!</p>

<p>I must have read through 30 or 40 chess books from that library
between age 7 and 9 before we moved again. During that time, I had
nobody to play with, because the one time in school recess I tried to
play with a classmate who claimed he knew how to play, he captured my
King after I overlooked a pin, and claimed victory, and would not
listen to me when I said I could not make an illegal make and Kings
cannot be captured! I did have one <a href="http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/05/30/life-lessons-i-learned-from-a-lunch-recess-chess-game-at-age-seven/">interesting experience with a chess
computer</a>.</p>

<p>I also started teaching my younger sister chess during this time
period (at around age 4), because I had no one else to play with other
than my father. And I lost every single game I played with my father,
because he would not let me win; he would give me chances when I was
losing, but <a href="http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/06/03/why-i-am-grateful-that-my-father-never-let-me-win-a-chess-game-against-him/">never let me actually win</a>!</p>

<h2 id="how-did-you-get-into-playing-in-chess-tournaments">How did you get into playing in chess tournaments?</h2>

<p>First, my father had to learn that there was such a thing as chess
tournaments for amateurs. This happened when he accidentally
discovered a chess club.</p>

<p>Shortly before I turned 10, my parents and my sister and I were at the
local community center (for a new job, my father had moved the family
again, to Madison Heights, Michigan) when my father heard strange
noises in the basement and wondered what was going on. He went down
and came back up all excited. My sister and I went back down with him,
and I still remember the thick cigar smoke and the men loudly banging
on ticking chess clocks while swearing and trash-talking during
blitz. My father and I joined the club and began playing in casual
blitz as well as in unrated club tournaments.</p>

<p>Everyone said we should also join the Michigan Chess Association and
the US Chess Federation and play in official rated tournaments. My
father said &ldquo;wait, we just paid for one membership and you want us to
pay for two others already?&ldquo;, but signed us up for MCA membership,
so that we could get the newsletter and stay informed.</p>

<h2 id="when-was-your-first-tournament-do-you-remember-what-you-felt-when-you-won-your-first-official-game">When was your first tournament? Do you remember what you felt when you won your first official game?</h2>

<p>By summer, everyone was excited about the upcoming annual Michigan
Open over Labor Day weekend, so we went, signed up with USCF, and
played in our first USCF rated tournament, the under-1800 Reserve
Section of the 1980 Michigan Open. I lost my first round game, but
in the second round, I won a very long, 88-move game as White (I
still have the original scoresheet and just looked over the game
again) against a 1400-rated opponent. My opponent made the final
blunder in an endgame, allowing me to trade into a King and Pawn
ending I knew was a win. I took the opposition, won the Pawn Queening
race, and knew how to win with a Queen against Knight Pawn.</p>

<p>It felt great to bounce back so quickly from a first round loss to
winning my first tournament game. I ended up scoring 3.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>.0 and
winning a 2nd place Unrated trophy, while my father won the 1st
place Unrated trophy. I achieved my first provisional rating of
1591, while his was 1574, lower than mine despite his higher score.</p>

<p>My father was so excited by our success that we continued playing
in tournaments for a while.</p>

<h2 id="what-happened-after-your-first-tournament">What happened after your first tournament?</h2>

<p>After our first tournament, my father and I were excited to continue
playing. He decided to continue playing in the Reserve Section while I
never played in the Reserve Section again after the first tournament,
because unlike him, I was not in it for the prizes but for the
challenge of playing against stronger opponents and getting better
myself. I did well in the Open Section of my second tournament three
months after my first, and my rating went up from 1591 to 1659, so
that was exciting. I won no prize, while my father got what he wanted
and won prizes for a fine performance in the Reserve Section. After
this second tournament, everyone was taking note of my progress, and
said I had talent. I didn&rsquo;t think so highly of myself, because by
then, I had met Ben Finegold, who was a year younger than me, but
already much better than me in the tournament scene.</p>

<p>In January 1981, my father applied for a chess scholarship from the
American Chess Foundation in order for fund some chess instruction for
me, and we got funding for ten lessons in May from the winner of
the 1980 Michigan Open, Master David Whitehouse.</p>

<p>Before the lessons even began, I had continued to do well in
tournaments, beat my first Expert, and gotten my rating up to 1741.</p>

<p>I very much enjoyed the lessons, and still remember a great deal from
them in retrospect. Mr. Whitehouse showed me some endgames, openings,
and illustrative games of his, but most of all, gave me a tremendously
useful book list, and I would even today recommend the study of many
of the classics that he listed.</p>

<h2 id="what-was-your-first-setback">What was your first setback?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, despite the ten weeks of instruction, it turned out
that I was stuck at a plateau for an entire year of tournament play,
not having gone higher than 1765. In fact, during my second year of
tournament play (age 11), I had my first loss against a lower-rated
opponent, my first draw against a lower-rated opponent, and my first
loss to an unrated opponent.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, my father himself had topped out at a rating of around
1774, I had finally beaten him at home (after which he never played a
game of chess again for another 20 years), family life was in disarray
as he looked for another job, and I was becoming a teenager and not
getting along with my parents or my teachers in school. So my father
let our USCF memberships expire, in July 1982, and my parents worried
that I was too obsessed with chess (my mother never approved of it in
the first place) and took away my chess set. I didn&rsquo;t protest too
much, because I had my own life problems at the time, plus had no idea
how to continue to improve in chess. So that&rsquo;s how I retired from
chess at age 12. Life was in disarray for everyone, and I almost
failed my classes in the fall during the 7th grade.</p>

<h2 id="when-did-you-return-to-chess-after-this-setback">When did you return to chess after this setback?</h2>

<p>Within the following year, some things had improved: my father had a
new job lined up, and he renewed my lapsed USCF membership and gave me
my chess set back. It was clear, though, that chess was only to be a
hobby and he would not be supporting me in any substantial way. In
1983-1985, I concluded my chess career of my youth by playing two
tournaments each of those years (during which my father had one more
job change, the final one of his career, and we had moved a couple
more times).</p>

<p>Through introspection, I did make a conscious effort to improve my
play and broke through my 1700 plateau quickly during my return to
chess at age 13, having missed age 12. I got up to 2050 when I was
15. All the while, though, I felt more and more that I still didn&rsquo;t
really understand chess, and Ben Finegold had long since made Master,
and would drop out of high school to move to Europe for a professional
chess career. I did still think enough about chess that I wrote my
college application on how chess is simultaneously an art, sport, and
science, and informed how I think about human endeavors.</p>

<p>Then chess ended for me for 20 years.</p>

<h2 id="as-your-rating-was-rising-say-after-it-past-1200-1500-1800-what-types-of-thoughts-did-you-have-did-you-think-you-would-one-day-become-a-chess-master-or-grandmaster-can-you-share-the-emotions-of-reaching-higher-ratings">As your rating was rising, say after it past 1200, 1500, 1800, what types of thoughts did you have? Did you think you would one day become a Chess Master or Grandmaster? Can you share the emotions of reaching higher ratings?</h2>

<p>In my youth, I never believed I was going to become a Master, and I
never acted as though I wanted to give it a try.</p>

<p>I liked to play, hoped I was improving, but didn&rsquo;t have the internal
drive or family support to do anything really serious with chess. I
didn&rsquo;t really play that much chess as a youth: in 1980-1985, I played
16 rated tournaments, for a total of 83 rated games that took me from
unrated to an initial rating of 1591 to a peak rating of 2050. Compare
with my adult tournament career so far from 2005-2015, which consisted
of 436 rated games: the vast majority of my chess playing has occurred
in my adulthood, with rating range from 2057 up finally to 2201.</p>

<p>My plateau at age 11, during which I received no encouragement or
support from anyone, made me pessimistic even when I recovered from
it. To be honest, during the entire time I played from 1983-1985, I
was afraid to have any serious expectations or goals. My own lack of
confidence combined with my fear of family disapproval caused me to
actually be relieved when I no longer had time for chess. In fact, I
considered myself rather lucky to have made it to past 2000 and had a
lingering fear that if I continued, I would just lose that.</p>

<h2 id="what-made-you-return-to-chess-after-a-20-year-absence">What made you return to chess after a 20 year absence?</h2>

<p>I did play a little bit of casual chess in my freshman year in
college, but then never played a game again for 17 years, nor did I
follow any chess world news during that time. Chess was dead to me
during those years.</p>

<p>But in the early 2000s, a friend mentioned that there were strong free
chess engines that were worth trying out. I was skeptical at first,
because in my youth I could beat chess computers. But I started
playing with some engines to see how much they had improved since my
childhood. They were still not so strong, but were definitely much
stronger!</p>

<p>I became very interested in whether the engines were strong enough to
resolve some analytical questions I had about complicated games in my
childhood in which I didn&rsquo;t know if I played something correctly (in
particular, some sacrifices). So my renewed interest in chess was not
as a competitor but as an analyst. I started reading chess books
again, and rejoining USCF, although not yet playing. In particular,
around 2003, my life was changed when a chess book showed up in the
public library, John Watson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Chess Strategy in Action&rdquo;. I checked it
out and it completely altered my perception of and understanding of
chess.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at this point in my life in my mid-30s, I was noticing
small but clear signs of physical and mental decline (I had peaked in
my 5K race speed) and thought to myself that I had unfinished business
in my life, dreams I gave up or did not allow myself in childhood,
that I should return to soon if I wanted to accomplish them at all
before it was too late. One of those dreams was to actually see how
well I can play chess if I committed to improvement, since I believed
deep in my heart that I had stopped before reaching my full potential.</p>

<p>I discovered the existence of the Pittsburgh Chess Club in 2004,
played a game of chess with my father while visiting him for
Christmas, our first game in over 20 years, and in 2005, started
playing in tournaments again.</p>

<h2 id="what-did-you-do-to-move-your-rating-up-did-you-study-a-lot-play-a-lot-what-types-of-exercises-did-you-do-did-you-have-chess-boards-set-up-at-places-in-the-house-was-there-anything-unique-you-could-share-that-readers-will-enjoy-knowing-or-reading">What did you do to move your rating up? Did you study a lot? play a lot? What types of exercises did you do? Did you have chess boards set up at places in the house? Was there anything unique you could share that readers will enjoy knowing or reading?</h2>

<p>In my youth, there were no chess engines or computers really worth
using, so progress was much harder for someone like me who was on his
own and did not have access to strong coaches (other than the ten free
lessons I received at age 11). So, I initially just learned from
playing blitz often at the club, playing in tournaments and reading
books and magazines.</p>

<p>To break my 1700 plateau, I studied specific opening systems that had
clear strategic goals for the middlegame. That made a huge difference
moving forward because I was no longer playing just randomly, but with
purpose. That worked to get me up to 2000+, but it was at that point
when I realized that I was holding myself back by playing only these
weird offbeat openings that I had studied. I had to go back to the
classics in order to rebuild myself to go beyond 2000.</p>

<p>I had another plateau during my entire first year back to chess in
adulthood, I was stuck at a plateau of the low 2000s and despaired of
ever improving beyond my childhood level. I realized that I had to
rebuild my chess understanding from scratch. I had never studied chess
systematically before, had a really spotty understanding of every
aspect of the game, from openings to middlegames to endgames. So in my
second year back, in 2006, I started rebuilding myself, gradually
transforming how I play. That paid off as I finally cracked 2100 and
then 2150, during 2006 and 2007. It was not until I passed 2100 that
for the first time in my life, I decided to set myself a goal of
making Master!</p>

<p>The single most helpful tool to me in recent years has been analyzing
my own games in detail with use of strong chess engines. I would say
this is more important than anything else. Being confronted with
reliable evidence of ideas or tactics that you missed (or your
opponent missed) must be the single most useful tool for improvement
available today that wasn&rsquo;t available in the pre-computer era. In
particular, computers make it easy to try &ldquo;what if&rdquo; by experimenting
with different continuations, setups, and see how they measure up.</p>

<h2 id="were-there-times-you-were-disappointed-with-yourself-and-thought-about-quitting-were-there-other-factors-like-friend-family-girlfriend-who-led-you-or-tried-to-dissuade-you-to-continue-playing-chess-is-there-any-story-you-would-like-to-share-on-this-topic">Were there times you were disappointed with yourself and thought about quitting? Were there other factors like friend, family, girlfriend who led you or tried to dissuade you to continue playing chess? Is there any story you would like to share on this topic?</h2>

<p>I have often been disappointed in my chess play, but interestingly,
never seriously thought about quitting except in one situation: I only
thought about quitting once I came close to reaching Master and kept
failing, which coincided chronologically with my meeting a young
woman.</p>

<p>Every loss or draw that set me back as I approached 2200 had a
tendency of making me feel like I didn&rsquo;t have what it takes. And
starting to date again in 2007 definitely began to take a toll on my
chess, both because Abby actively opposed my chess activities at the
time and because of my whole schedule and routine was disrupted,
making tournament play difficult logistically. By the time we got
married in 2009, I had basically quit chess, and I thought for good,
and not willingly but as a concession. I periodically tried to come
back and play, but always less well than I was capable, because of
being rusty, unsupported, and tired. It wasn&rsquo;t until the second half
of 2015 that I was ready to try again to play the best I could, this
time finally with complete emotional support from Abby, who had
finally come to understand how much chess meant to me. I also canceled
a lot of my usual activities in the second half of 2015 in order to
focus my energy outside of work on chess, and all this paid off.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-single-most-important-factor-a-chess-player-must-consider-to-move-up-his-her-rating">What is the single, most important factor a chess player must consider to move up his/her rating?</h2>

<p>We all hit a plateau at some point, at which we are apparently making
the same kinds of errors that stronger players are not making, so
somehow we have to change the kinds of errors that we make.</p>

<p>I think the most powerful tool available is analysis of your own
games. Each game you play has the fingerprints of your personal
weaknesses all over it. Using a chess engine, and ideally a strong
human guide who can explain concepts and variations that lie behind
the engine&rsquo;s numerical evaluations, you can learn to gradually remove
errors. For example, if you lost an otherwise good game only because
of one misconception during an endgame, avoiding that single error in
the future could pay off in any number of similar situations. Or if
you misplayed an opening, rebuilding your thought process that led to
a strategic misunderstanding can help in all future games using that
opening.</p>

<h2 id="have-you-been-close-to-2200-several-times-and-then-fell-therefore-postponing-the-master-level-can-you-give-details-of-how-you-felt">Have you been close to 2200 several times and then fell? (therefore postponing the Master level)? Can you give details of how you felt?</h2>

<p>Yes, I have been close several times! In fact, a couple of times I had
2200 locked up, in the sense that if I had withdrawn from a tournament
in progress, I would have guaranteed going over 2200 based on the wins
I had already racked up in the tournament.</p>

<p>The first time was in the 2007 PA State Action Championship. I went in
at 2171 and had won the first three rounds. In the fourth round, I had
a totally won game against a Master and nerves got to me and I fell
apart and lost. In the final round, I had a totally won game against
an 1800 and fell apart and lost. This was my first experience of
completely choking under the pressure of knowing I was very close to
2200.</p>

<p>Then in January 2008, I had a rating of 2197 from a Pittsburgh Chess
League round. The thing you have to understand is that in
January-February, I was simultaneously playing in the PCC Championship
held on Tuesday nights, and had won my first three rounds by February,
which meant that if I had withdrawn, I would have secured far more
than the 3 rating points necessary to go over 2200. But I had never
withdrawn from a tournament in my life, and didn&rsquo;t want to achieve
Master through calculated cowardice. So I played on. But I choked, and
proceeded to draw the fourth game and lose the fifth. I continued to
play worse as I got engaged to be married, and quit chess the year of
my marriage in 2009.</p>

<p>I periodically came back in 2010-2012 but just played worse and worse,
unforced errors. In 2013, I started recovering, and in 2014, I again
almost made Master. At 2195, I choked, losing a won game against a
much lower-rated player while a Rook up! All I needed was to win that
game to make Master. And I kept on choking in tournaments after that.</p>

<p>In fall of 2015, I more or less stopped choking. I still played badly
sometimes, but I distinguish between poor quality of play and just
plain choking. How did I stop choking? I stopped paying attention to
my rating. In fact, in my final tournament games of 2015 that led me
to go over 2200, I did not do any calculations to determine whether I
would or would not go over. I knew it could be close, but did not want
to calculate. I tried to focus on my games and nothing else.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still proud that I made Master without the trick of withdrawing
from any tournaments.</p>

<h2 id="can-you-discuss-which-is-more-important-for-chess-improvement-studying-the-opening-middlegame-or-endgame-explain-why">Can you discuss which is more important for chess improvement: studying the opening, middlegame, or endgame? Explain why.</h2>

<p>The short answer is that everything is actually interconnected, and I
wish I had known this earlier. A quality game will have a story behind
it that connects all phases of chess. Because of this, I think the
study of complete, annotated games (including annotating your own
games) is the single most useful technique for improvement.</p>

<p>For example, opening study is popular, but studying the opening in
isolation, apart from understanding fundamental principles and knowing
not to fall into tricky traps, is almost irrelevant at under-2000
level, where games will mostly be decided not by opening subtleties,
but by later parts of the game.</p>

<p>My main improvements have come from understanding the middlegame
better, learning how to assess positions and create plans based on
features of the positions, especially through considering Pawn
structure. If you think of an opening as a way to try to get to a
certain kind of middlegame, and think of the middlegame as a way to
get to a certain kind of endgame, then everything starts to fit
together. The middlegame is the core.</p>

<p>Improving in the endgame is important at all levels.  When I look at
my first tournament games at a 1500-1600 level, I see that the vast
majority of them went into endgames where anything could happen
because none of us really knew what we were doing, but I managed draws
and wins because I was a bit better there than opponents who otherwise
matched me in the opening and middlegame.</p>

<p>With my young students, I go over the opening phase with them only
enough for them to survive it (by playing classically and avoiding
needlessly complex and subtle variations), but focus my instruction
primarily on how to get to a desired middlegame by means of opening
choice. I also add endgame instruction incrementally as it becomes a
bottleneck in overall performance: when they get good enough to get a
dominating middlegame and then fail to win in the endgame, that&rsquo;s when
we work on the endgame. But I feel like spending a lot of time on the
endgame up front is not realistic if one is not even surviving the
middlegame.</p>

<p>No, there was no celebration. I have to confess I&rsquo;m not really a
celebration kind of person.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-your-plans-now">What are your plans now?</h2>

<p>I will continue what I&rsquo;ve already been doing in chess since 2012:
writing and teaching.</p>

<p>I started writing about chess on my personal blog around 2012. I
really enjoy sharing my analysis and thoughts with others, and this
eventually led to my writing for GM Nigel Davies&rsquo; <a href="http://ChessImprover.com/author/FranklinC/">The Chess Improver</a>
site and giving private chess lessons since 2013. I am still teaching
now and very much enjoy helping others improve their chess. So
teaching has been my main focus in chess for a while now.</p>

<p>I will continue to play in local tournaments as time permits. I am not
done improving yet! Also, I enjoy being a role model for my students,
to walk the walk as I give them advice about how to study, improve,
and compete. I have even been inspired to try to play model games to
illustrate specific themes I teach. For example, last year when the
subject was isolated Pawns, I played a game in which I chose an
opening aimed specifically against an isolated Pawn structure.</p>

<h2 id="update-of-2016-06-25">(Update of 2016-06-25)</h2>

<p>I still play chess with my father whenever I see him. He&rsquo;s still
playing pretty well at age 78. I feel he is possibly even better than
when he was in his 40s, probably because he has all the time in the
world to play casual games regularly at his local community center
since retirement. It&rsquo;s actually harder for me to beat him now than
when I was a kid. Here&rsquo;s a photo from the last visit to my parents&rsquo; in
May 2016; I barely managed to win this game, where I took advantage of
the weakness of his isolated Pawn in the endgame:</p>
