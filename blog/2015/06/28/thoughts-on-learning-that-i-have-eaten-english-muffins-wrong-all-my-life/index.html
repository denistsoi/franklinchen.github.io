    <h1>Thoughts on learning that I have eaten English muffins wrong all my life</h1>
    

<p>Today, I found out I had been eating
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_muffin">English muffins</a>
<em>wrong</em> my whole life.</p>

<h2 id="the-story">The story</h2>

<p>This morning, while at breakfast in a hotel before Abby and I were
checking out before returning home, I suddenly decided I might as well
change things up and eat my egg and sausage patties inside the halves
of an English muffin (yesterday I had eaten them alone, and an
uninspiring crappy plain bagel on the side).</p>

<p>As I was about to bite into my sandwich, Abby interrupted me and said,
&ldquo;You need to toast the English muffin.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never toasted an
English muffin.&rdquo; She made a face of disgust and said, &ldquo;Eww, that&rsquo;s
<em>wrong</em>, English muffins are designed to be eaten toasted! They are
disgusting raw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I disputed that there was a &ldquo;right&rdquo; way to eat English muffins, but
allowed her to toast the muffin halves for me.</p>

<p>The resulting sandwich tasted pretty good. I then realized that I had
been eating English muffins wrong my entire life. How could this be?</p>

<h2 id="my-breakfast-growing-up-in-america">My breakfast growing up in America</h2>

<p>You have to understand that I spent the first couple of years of my
remembered childhood, as the first child of immigrant parents to
America, eating a breakfast that often consisted of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congee">congee</a> (rice porridge) with
toppings (I particularly liked pickled cucumbers and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rousong">rousong</a>, a dried pork product).</p>

<p>Bread was not part of my usual diet until I went to Kindergarten in
New York City, where I ate free lunches and was introduced to such
bizarre concepts as the grilled
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese_sandwich">cheese sandwich</a>.</p>

<p>I did increasingly eat &ldquo;American&rdquo; foods as I grew up, but still, I was
never introduced to the full variety of breakfast foods for a long
time. It wasn&rsquo;t until I was over ten years old, for example, that I
took the initiative and convinced my mother that we should try out
pancakes and waffles and cinnamon toast. Jellies, jams, syrup, butter
really came into my life then.</p>

<p>But English muffins were somehow left out. My mother bought them but
apparently <em>we ate them wrong</em>. We didn&rsquo;t toast them. And because <em>they
didn&rsquo;t taste so good</em> to me, I never really ate them again. For the
next decades of my life, given a choice, I never took an English
muffin if I could instead eat a donut, cupcake, bagel, or ordinary
sliced bread. I had come to associate English muffins with &ldquo;not
tasty&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learned-from-my-conversion-today">Lessons learned from my conversion today</h2>

<p>Well, this morning I learned that toasted English muffins are actually
pretty good. They have a particular texture, form factor, aroma,
crispness when toasted. Although I currently try to limit my intake of
bread in general, in the future if I am confronted with the usual free
hotel breakfast, I will definitely choose English muffins!</p>

<p>After we returned home, I actually looked online to find out the
&ldquo;truth&rdquo; about English muffins. Well, it turns out that a lot of people
online do note that raw English muffins don&rsquo;t taste so good.</p>

<p>What broader lessons have I learned?</p>

<ul>
<li>It is possible for an immigrant to live in a country for decades and
yet not fully understand what a native does, simply because of early
choices or misleading experiences in some aspect of life.</li>
<li>Just because something tastes bad in one form doesn&rsquo;t mean it has to
taste bad in <em>all</em> its possible forms (I am always learning this; I only
recently learned to <a href="../../../../../blog/2014/03/21/time-to-taste-the-world-thoughts-on-expanding-my-food-tastes-as-an-adult">enjoy Brussels sprouts</a>.</li>
<li>Although there is no such thing, objectively, as preparing or eating
something the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; way, you might find some ways (including
generally accepted traditional practices) to have merit.</li>
<li>People don&rsquo;t always tell you when you&rsquo;re doing something
&ldquo;wrong&rdquo;. Some might just be polite and remain silent. Others might
let the oddity slip because they think you are just being weird and
truly enjoy raw English muffins. Don&rsquo;t make the assumption that
people are doing what they really like; they could just be operating
out of habit and not knowing or having explored an alternative.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I enjoyed learning that English muffins are actually edible after
all. I don&rsquo;t really expect to ever eat a raw English muffin again.</p>

<p><strong>Has anyone ever pointed out something to you that you weren&rsquo;t aware
  of even though maybe you &ldquo;should&rdquo; have known? Did you feel
  embarrassed or argue, or did you try out the new suggestion? When
  you see someone doing something weird, do you ever step in and offer
  a suggestion, or do you prefer to be polite and not be nosy?</strong></p>

<h2 id="postscript">Postscript</h2>

<p>This evening when discussing the breakfast incident with Abby, somehow
the subject of bagels came up and she said something about toasting
bagels, and I recoiled in horror, because I was pretty sure that
<em>bagels are not supposed to be toasted</em>. Again, I had to consult the
Internet to find out the &ldquo;truth&rdquo;.</p>

<p>As you might expect, the truth is that I grew up with bagels living in
New York City and the East Coast in general, before moving to the
Midwest. <a href="http://www.thedailymeal.com/real-new-yorkers-dont-toast-their-bagels">&ldquo;Real New Yorkers don&rsquo;t toast their bagels&rdquo;</a>.
If you have access to a fresh, good bagel, it&rsquo;s pretty wrong to toast
it, right? Well, as the article points out, there are differing
opinions, admittedly, and nobody argues that a crappy stale bagel or a
frozen one shouldn&rsquo;t be toasted. Still, out of sheer habit, I have
never toasted a bagel, even if it might deserve toasting. Interesting,
huh? It&rsquo;s just a habit. I see the logic of reviving a bagel as
needed. So I will consider toasting crappy bagels in the future if
they need that treatment.</p>
