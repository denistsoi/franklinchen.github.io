    <h1>Revisiting Bach&#39;s Air on G String, from a singing and dancing viewpoint</h1>
    

<p>Three years ago, <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/09/14/passion-of-bachs-air-on-the-g-string-three-different-interpretations/">I wrote a post comparing three very different
performance styles</a>
for Johann Sebastian Bach&rsquo;s famous music,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_on_the_G_String">Air on G String</a>
and indicating which I preferred.</p>

<p>I have received an unexpected number comments over the years, and
thought it was time to write an update of my thoughts in response.</p>

<p>Primarily, I am responding to those who (correctly) criticized the
unfortunately chosen exemplar of the style that I preferred. I tried
to find better versions that might illustrate my perceptions. I also
integrated some thoughts based on how I perceive music as a singer and
as a dancer.</p>

<h2 id="better-than-the-rushed-croatian-baroque-ensemble-s-performance">Better than the rushed Croatian Baroque Ensemble&rsquo;s performance?</h2>

<p>I agreed quickly with the first commenters that the Croatian
ensemble&rsquo;s performance was too perfunctory, even downright brutal and
unpleasant in various ways. I wish I had
chosen a better example of what I actually <em>like</em> rather than <em>prefer
to the other two versions</em>.</p>

<p>I searched YouTube for period-style performances that are
closer to what I envision than either the Croatian ensemble&rsquo;s or
Koopman&rsquo;s. It proved impossible for me to find a perfect performance.</p>

<h2 id="a-period-performance-i-like-more-christopher-hogwood">A period performance I like more: Christopher Hogwood</h2>

<p>I like this version by the late <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Hogwood">Christopher Hogwood</a>&rsquo;s Academy of
Ancient Music:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nrtdhH8_47k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>There is a sweetness and <em>bouncy lightness</em> to this version that I
like, but it is also somewhat anemic. Personally, I would play up more
contrast and fullness of sound and passion, but the overall tempo and
breathing to this version seems right to me.</p>

<h2 id="voices-of-music-richer-sound">&ldquo;Voices of Music&rdquo;: richer sound</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Voices of Music&rdquo; here in a good performance:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pzlw6fUux4o" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>I like the richness of sound in this performance. I miss the lighter,
more bouncy feeling that Hogwood brought out though. This performance
is a bit too legato for me.</p>

<h2 id="i-care-about-singing">I care about singing</h2>

<p>I approach this music from the viewpoint of singing.</p>

<p>The bouncy lightness is very important to me, along with the rhythmic
characterization. I feel this music as a song (it is an &ldquo;air&rdquo;, after
all), and I cannot help singing along when I hear it. Therefore, when
it&rsquo;s taken too slow for me to sing and make it to natural breathing
points in phrases, that considerably lessens my pleasure.</p>

<h3 id="yehudi-menuhin-solo-violin">Yehudi Menuhin, solo violin</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an interesting old black and white video of a performance by a young Yehudi Menuhin on violin with
accompaniment. It&rsquo;s not a period performance, but moves along at a
decent &ldquo;singing&rdquo; tempo, as befits violin, that singing instrument.</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/08bDiKXW0gg" frameborder="0"
allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>I confess that I rather like this performance for its virtues,
although it distorts Bach&rsquo;s music by so emphasizing just the musical
line, at the expense of the balance of the other voices and the
essential character of the dissonances among the voices.</p>

<h3 id="more-menuhin-but-as-conductor">More Menuhin, but as conductor</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s Yehudi Menuhin not as violin soloist but as conductor of the
Bath Festival Orchestra in 1960. Again, not a period performance, but
he takes the music briskly, and has the violins create sufficient
phrase delineations that I feel the music alertly as though it sings.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s direct and clear, maybe not the most subtle and warm,
but I like it.</p>

<h2 id="dancing-is-possible-too">Dancing is possible too</h2>

<p>I also like to dance to expressive music. A pioneer of modern dance,
Doris Humphrey, famously choreographed a dance to a slowish
performance of this music:</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NjwJyaSIRqY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>This is not how I would dance to it, because I feel the music
differently. Surprisingly, I could find few examples on YouTube of
dancing to this music. I may consider choreographing a dance myself as
a project to express my own personal vision.</p>

<p>One thing I would like to mention is that I feel that the <em>walking bass</em>
is very important in this music and gives it the impetus. When played
too slow, the walking bass no longer feels like it&rsquo;s walking.</p>

<p>I feel this music in my legs, not just in my lungs. Yes, I have
actually hummed it to myself while walking in time to the bass
leisurely in the local park. There is a limit to how &ldquo;leisurely&rdquo; I can
walk without feeling frustrated.</p>

<h3 id="ice-dancing">Ice dancing</h3>

<p>I found this somewhat frenetic but nevertheless beautiful ice dancing
performance from the 1992 World Figure Skating Championships:</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1JjbwtM_E3g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h2 id="recorder-quartet">Recorder quartet</h2>

<p>A final performance to enjoy: the Japanese &ldquo;Sekishi Recorder Quartet&rdquo;
playing their hearts out in 2009. I think it&rsquo;s lovely: impeccable
phrasing, transparency,
and rich ensemble balance and tone. (As a twist, the melody line performer adds
his own ornamentations.)</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pRRRK0UClNs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I was inspired by the accumulated comments on my previous post on
Bach&rsquo;s &ldquo;Air on G String&rdquo; that I decided to flesh out my thoughts by
using more example performances, as well as relate the orchestral
music to singing and dancing. I hope you have enjoyed these
explorations. There is no single &ldquo;right&rdquo; way to experience music, but
I wanted to share how I experience it.</p>

<p><strong>If you&rsquo;ve read my previous post, does this one help clarify where
  I&rsquo;m coming from with my musical values? Do you dance
  or sing? Does this affect how you perceive this piece of music and
  like to perform it or hear it performed?</strong></p>
