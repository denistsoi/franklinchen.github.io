    <h1>Clever chess tactics that were not what they seemed</h1>
    

<p>In round 3 of the current 6-round Pittsburgh Chess Club Tuesday night
tournament, I played a very tense game that led to an unusual position
with beautiful tactical possibilities. My opponent, Melih, is a strong
player who is a winner of the 2015 Pittsburgh Chess Club Championship earlier
this year, and had won the last two tournament games we have played,
so I came into this game anxious and also thirsty for revenge.</p>

<p>The game proved to be very challenging for both of us. I achieved a
better position out of the opening as Black but was too cautious to
press more aggressively. After more than 3 hours (!) of play, we ended
up in a simplified late middlegame in which I had only a small but
clear advantage. We were both clearly physically and mentally
exhausted, and starting to run out of time (these tournament games
have a time control of 2 hours per person with a 5-second delay per
move). It was up to me to try to find a way to win by inducing errors
in his play.</p>

<h2 id="get-ready-to-be-quizzed">Get ready to be quizzed!</h2>

<p>What ended up happening was in retrospect both remarkable and
comic. To maximize your entertainment as well as challenge your
tactical skills, I recommend pausing at each diagrammed position below
in order to ask yourself what move you would play, and why, before
gradually uncovering the whole story.</p>

<p>Note: an interactive chess board with all variations is provided at
the end of this article.</p>

<h2 id="first-assess-a-quiet-looking-starting-position">First, assess a quiet-looking starting position</h2>

<p>For context, here is the position after 21 moves, after Black played
21&hellip;Qc6.</p>

<h3 id="questions">Questions</h3>

<ul>
<li>What opening do you think this middlegame came from?</li>
<li>Who stands better and why?</li>
<li>What is White&rsquo;s best plan, and what is Black&rsquo;s best plan?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="answers">Answers</h3>

<p>Congratulations if you guessed this was a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Defence#Advance_Variation:_3.e5">French Defense, Advance Variation</a>,
  gone totally wrong for White!</p>

<p>Black stands better and has a simple plan:</p>

<ul>
<li>attack White&rsquo;s backward Pawn on c3 on the half-open file, and
perhaps also the e5 Pawn as well; and the a2 Pawn and b4 Pawn are
also potential targets</li>
<li>use the half-open c-file for the Rooks, and the dark-squared Bishop
against White&rsquo;s Pawns, and get the Queen involved as well</li>
<li>using these attacks, overload White&rsquo;s defenses somehow in order to
win at least one of those Pawns to enter a probably winning endgame</li>
</ul>

<p>White&rsquo;s only possible counter-plan:</p>

<ul>
<li>defend the weak Queen side Pawns</li>
<li>maybe plant the Knight on a good outpost such as d4</li>
<li>defend the Pawn on e5 with maybe an f4 advance, and hope to attack
Black&rsquo;s King side with perhaps an f5 break</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="progress-after-seven-moves">Progress after seven moves?</h2>

<p>Black has just played 28&hellip;Rc4.</p>

<h3 id="questions-1">Questions</h3>

<ul>
<li>Who has made more progress in the last seven moves: White or Black?</li>
<li>What is the nature of the progress made?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="answers-1">Answers</h3>

<p>White has played to wait to see what Black is up to; meanwhile, Black
has made some progress on the Queen side by:</p>

<ul>
<li>doubling Rooks on the half-open c-file</li>
<li>using the Queen to bear down on White&rsquo;s a-Pawn, which White has
(mistakenly) advanced to a3.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="white-played-a-surprising-move">White played a surprising move</h2>

<p>White has just played 29 Rac2.</p>

</figure>


<h3 id="questions-2">Questions</h3>

<p>On the 29th move, White moved the Rook from a2 to c2, leaving the
defense of the a3 Pawn.</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the meaning of this strange move?!</li>
<li>Can Black just take the Pawn with the Queen?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="answers-2">Answers</h3>

<p>You may be thinking &ldquo;White is provocatively setting a trap for Black
to fall into&rdquo;. You get credit if you can see the trap.</p>

<h2 id="black-fell-into-a-trap">Black fell into a trap?</h2>

<p>I played 29&hellip;Qxa3.</p>


<figure >

        <h4>29...Qxa3; White to move</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>But wait, I took the Pawn! Did I fall into a trap?</p>

<h3 id="questions-3">Questions</h3>

<ul>
<li>What is the trap you saw earlier, if you saw it?</li>
<li>Is it really a trap?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="white-closed-the-trap">White closed the trap?</h2>

<p>White has played 30 Ra2.</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="../../../../../chess/ozbek-chen-2015-11-17/30b.png" />

        <h4>30 Ra2; Black to move</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<h3 id="answers-3">Answers</h3>

<p>So the Rook moved back to a2, apparently trapping Black&rsquo;s Queen. But
again, was it really a trap?</p>

<h2 id="black-refuted-the-trap">Black refuted the trap?</h2>

<p>Black played 30&hellip;Rxd4.</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="../../../../../chess/ozbek-chen-2015-11-17/31w.png" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>30...Rxd4; White to move</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>You get credit if you saw this move taking White&rsquo;s Knight on d4, and
saw that White&rsquo;s Queen is overloaded such that retaking the Rook in
either one of two ways leads to losing back the Rook on c1 and
therefore losing a piece overall and the game.</p>

<p>I was very proud of seeing this tactic. (If you saw a different move
for Black, we&rsquo;ll discuss that further down below.)</p>

<h2 id="white-refuted-the-refutation">White refuted the refutation?</h2>

<p>White played 31 Qc2.</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="../../../../../chess/ozbek-chen-2015-11-17/31b.png" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>31 Qc2; Black to move</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>When Melih moved his Queen to c2, I was in shock and disgust at
myself: in my fatigue near the end of this game, and overexcitement at
believing I had &ldquo;refuted&rdquo; a &ldquo;trap&rdquo;, I had completely failed to take
into account that White was not actually required to take my Rook on d4!</p>

<p>Amusingly, it turns out that Melih, after playing 29 Rac2 setting the
&ldquo;trap&rdquo;, saw to his horror the resource 30&hellip;Rxd4, and thought he was
lost, but then saw 31 Qc2. So neither of us had originally seen this
saving resource for White.</p>

<h3 id="questions-4">Questions</h3>

<ul>
<li>Is Black&rsquo;s Queen trapped for real now?</li>
<li>What should Black do? Is Black lost? Or is Black still winning? Or
should Black start looking for a draw?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="black-panicked-trying-to-draw">Black panicked, trying to draw</h2>

<p>Yes, Black&rsquo;s Queen is trapped for real. You get credit if you saw
that Black&rsquo;s flashy 30&hellip;Rxd4 had this flaw.</p>

<p>The only question for me was how best to give up my Queen.</p>

<p>I chose poorly. In a daze, I could not think straight. I chose to give
back a Rook with 31&hellip;Qxc3, in order to force a trade Queens on c3 and
go into an endgame an exchange down for two Pawns, and hope for a draw.</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="../../../../../chess/ozbek-chen-2015-11-17/36w.png" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>31...Qxc3; White to move</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>I was correct that the resulting position was objectively equal and
drawable, but in a time scramble, it&rsquo;s obviously easier to play White,
and for the rest of the game, both sides made major errors (with White
botching up winning positions and Black botching up drawn positions)
until a simplified position was reached (Rook and two Pawns for each
side) with only seconds left on the clock, and a draw agreed. I
consider myself lucky to have drawn. The final position was:</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="../../../../../chess/ozbek-chen-2015-11-17/draw.png" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Agreed drawn</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<h2 id="but-black-could-have-played-to-win">But Black could have played to win</h2>

<p>You get credit if you chose instead to sacrifice the Queen with
31&hellip;Qxc1+ to get the Rook and Bishop and Pawns against White&rsquo;s Queen,
with advantage and a good chance of winning. After 32 Qxc1 Bxb4, Black
is about to win White&rsquo;s c3 Pawn:</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="../../../../../chess/ozbek-chen-2015-11-17/33rooksw.png" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>32...Bxb4; White to move</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>In fact, if you saw all this when thinking about whether to take the
Pawn on a3 in the first place, then you get bonus points for seeing a
way to an advantage through the sequence of tactical blows. Neither
Melih nor I saw any of this up front, unfortunately.</p>

<p>I chickened out and did not take this continuation because after being
shocked that my Queen was disappearing, I experienced a visceral fear
that I needed to bring down White&rsquo;s Queen also, else it with White&rsquo;s
Rook might be dangerous to my King.</p>

<p>It turns out that my fear was objectively unwarranted, as Black&rsquo;s
defenses are sufficient because of the power of the dark-squared
Bishop to hit White&rsquo;s e5 Pawn and even the f2 Pawn, but I was not
thinking straight any more as time was running out for the four-hour
game and it was already around 11 PM at night on a weekday.</p>

<h3 id="one-possible-position">One possible position</h3>

<p>Here is a position that might have arisen if I had gone into this
variation:</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="../../../../../chess/ozbek-chen-2015-11-17/35rooksw.png" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>White to move</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>The thing is, even though the computer says Black has an advantage, it
could be scary playing against White&rsquo;s Queen.</p>

<h3 id="another-possible-position">Another possible position</h3>

<p>But analysis also shows that White has to be very careful. For
example, if White is greedy and wastes time taking Black&rsquo;s a7 Pawn
above, Black quickly gets a winning attack:</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="../../../../../chess/ozbek-chen-2015-11-17/37rooksw.png" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>White to move</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>In time pressure, anything can happen, and I think it would have been
very likely that White would have grabbed the a7 Pawn, after which
Black&rsquo;s position play itself.</p>

<h2 id="finally-black-s-real-refutation">Finally: Black&rsquo;s real refutation!</h2>

<p>I said you get extra credit for seeing everything to the point of
sacrificing Black&rsquo;s Queen for an advantage. But you only get full
credit if you saw the real refutation of White&rsquo;s &ldquo;trap&rdquo; earlier in the
game! I kicked myself for not having seen it.</p>

<h3 id="questions-5">Questions</h3>

<ul>
<li>Was there a point at which Black could have deviated and won the
game outright?</li>
<li>Hint: which of Black&rsquo;s pieces have we not focused on in the
variations covered so far?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="answers-4">Answers</h3>

<p>Black could, after White &ldquo;trapped&rdquo; the Queen with 30 Ra2, used a
different and better deflection of White&rsquo;s overloaded Queen than
30&hellip;Rxd4, which was OK but not best.</p>

<p>We haven&rsquo;t looked at Black&rsquo;s Bishop enough. I only saw this upon
recovering from the draw and analyzing the game later at home: the
winning shot is 30&hellip;Bg5!</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="../../../../../chess/ozbek-chen-2015-11-17/31varw.png" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>White to move</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>If White blocks the threat to the Queen with 31 f4,
then Black just lops off the Pawn with 31&hellip;Bxf4 and now:</p>

<ul>
<li>if White takes the Bishop or otherwise moves the Queen, Black will
win either the Rook on a2 or the Rook on c1</li>
<li>if White takes Black&rsquo;s Queen, then Black takes White&rsquo;s Queen on d2
with tempo and will eventually win all three of White&rsquo;s weak
Pawns on dark squares (c3 followed by e5 and b4)</li>
</ul>

<p>Either way, the endgame is an easy win for Black.</p>

<p>Neither Melih nor I saw this winning resource for Black during the
game. We just weren&rsquo;t looking at that quiet Bishop because it hadn&rsquo;t
participated in anything up till that point.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Chess never ceases to surprise me. Tactical possibilities are
everywhere, and in this game, both Melih and I missed various
possible continuations, playing moves thinking we knew what had to
follow. I hope you enjoyed this story of missed opportunities and
incomplete calculations.</p>

<p>My thanks to Melih for a challenging and fascinating game, and sharing
his thoughts with me afterwards.</p>
