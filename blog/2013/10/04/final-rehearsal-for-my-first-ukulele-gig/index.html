    <h1>Final rehearsal for my first ukulele gig: and some hard decisions about music in my life</h1>
    

<p>The night before our Ecofest gig, those of us in the Steel City Ukuleles who are performing in it had one final rehearsal.</p>

<p>It was a very good rehearsal. We&rsquo;re sounding more and more together as an ensemble, ending solidly on each song the way we agreed, and singing more in tune and balance.</p>

<p>Also, Sunny reminded us that we are <em>performing</em>, and so we should not just grimly look at our music booklets, but instead, when we can, we should look up and smile and engage with the audience.</p>

<h2 id="singing">Singing</h2>

<p>I still don&rsquo;t have all the songs down as much as I would like, but by the end of the two-hour rehearsal, I was totally <em>hoarse</em>. I am ready to sing out strong while simultaneously playing my ukulele.</p>

<p>I just realized that <strong>in the past three months, I have sung more than in the previous forty years of my life combined</strong>. Wow. And I&rsquo;m loving it. There&rsquo;s nothing like singing, especially singing with others.</p>

<h2 id="performance-is-time-and-energy-consuming">Performance is time and energy consuming</h2>

<p>I almost didn&rsquo;t make it to the rehearsal. I&rsquo;ve completely exhausted myself this week with work and other activities, and badly need a break. There are times, such as earlier today, when I felt overwhelmed by everything.</p>

<p>In fact, yesterday, in discussing my musical plans for the coming months with Abby, I made some decisions.</p>

<p>This is my last ukulele gig for the year, for sure. I want to get back to basics and work on my technique and in really mastering some songs, rather than get back on the treadmill of more material for performance.</p>

<p>Also, this winter, I am not planning to participate in performing on recorder for the holiday gigs at Phipps Conservatory &ldquo;candlelight evenings&rdquo; that I&rsquo;ve treasured <a href="../../../../../blog/2011/12/05/busy-evening-performing-at-phipps-followed-by-rehearsal-for-another-gig/">in 2011</a> and <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/12/09/playing-music-on-recorders-at-a-phipps-conservatory-candlelight-evening/">in 2012</a>. That was always a huge amount of work for me. Unless I can participate in significantly reduced capacity, I don&rsquo;t see how I can manage.</p>

<p>I will probably perform in the <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/12/14/pittsburgh-contras-and-squares-holiday-ball-2012/">Pittsburgh Contras and Squares Holiday Ball</a> again, because it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve been doing with Abby every year, and because after two years of doing it, I know the music, and therefore it will not require much work to participate in (if I want to do some Irish flute and tin whistle solos, of course, then I can add as much extra work for myself that I want, ha).</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-best-use-of-my-limited-time-and-energy-for-music">What is the best use of my limited time and energy for music?</h2>

<p>Also, there have been announcements and reminders for some time about recorder and ukulele <em>workshops</em> and <em>concerts</em> coming up soon. I have decided not to sign up for any of them, because I really need some rest time on <em>weekends</em> that I have not been getting; weekends are also the time when I can do more household chores and spend time with Abby.</p>

<p>I find that my main enjoyment and improvement in music comes form what I do daily, anyway, rather than what I can possibly do in a long, extended workshop format. I&rsquo;ve always been frustrated that when I attend a one or two day conference or workshop on any subject (computer programming, salsa dance, etc.), I don&rsquo;t actually retain or engage with as much as I would like. There are ways to optimize these experiences, but that requires a certain kind of immediate followup that I don&rsquo;t have time for right now.</p>

<p>So, I will sadly miss the fantastic <a href="http://www.flanders-recorder-quartet.be/en/home/">Flanders Recorder Quartet</a> when they come to Pittsburgh in November, and I will miss the workshop Annie has arranged for them to give here for the local recorder community.</p>

<p>And I am going to miss <a href="http://www.coolhanduke.com/">Cool Hand Uke</a> when he comes to Pittsburgh to give a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Steel-City-Ukuleles/events/135233932/">workshop</a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Steel-City-Ukuleles/events/138577782/">concert</a>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Life is full of choices, especially for those of us who have many interests, not just one. This week I made some decisions about my involvement with music in October, November, and December.</p>
