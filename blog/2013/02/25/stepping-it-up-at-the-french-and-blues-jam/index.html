    <h1>Stepping it up at the French and blues jam</h1>
    

<p>Last month, I reported on <a href="../../../../../blog/2013/01/28/my-first-blues-music-jam-happened-after-the-regular-french-music-jam/">exciting new developments in the local French/blues music jam</a> that happens approximately once a month. We continued with the excitement this month, playing more complex and difficult tunes that Lisa, John, Donna, and others have been transcribing.</p>

<p>By the way, if you are interested in checking out some of our growing French repertoire, take a look at our <a href="http://drawthedots.com/">transcriptions</a>, choosing tunebook &ldquo;Campanule by Gregory Dyke&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tunes for Mondays by Lisa Tamres&rdquo;. These tunebooks are always in progress, so not everything we know or are working on has been put up yet.</p>

<p>And if you live in the Pittsburgh area and would like to join in playing with us in the future, contact me!</p>

<h2 id="french-jam">French jam</h2>

<p>I arrived somewhat late because I was coming from leaving the <a href="../../../../../blog/2013/02/25/openhack-pittsburgh-studying-scala/">second OpenHack Pittsburgh</a> early (regrettably); in retrospect, I was trying to squeeze in too much on a Monday evening and should have skipped attending OpenHack Pittsburgh, but I had too much enjoyed <a href="../../../../../blog/2013/01/21/attending-the-first-openhack-pittsburgh-meeting/">the first one</a>.</p>

<p>When I arrived, Lisa, John, and Allison were already playing together (on fiddle, accordion, piano), and I joined them for two hours of jamming and playing for the dancers who arrived later.</p>

<p>I was excited to be learning new (to me) music, in various different keys and modes and rhythms, while all still falling in the categories of waltz, mazurka, bourr√©e, Schottisch. Because of all the different keys, I ended up only playing my modern flute, not ever switching to my Irish flute.</p>

<p>We took turns looking through some transcriptions and deciding what to work on, and one song I chose was something called &ldquo;Les Ormeaux&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a lovely song. Here is a performance of it on accordion I found:</p>

<h3 id="upcoming-french-dance-workshop">Upcoming French dance workshop</h3>

<p>Another French dance workshop is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/161251944027578/">being held at CMU on Saturday, March 9</a>. There was discussion of getting a group of us together to play live music for the workshop. This reminded me that it was a year ago that I <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/01/23/discovering-french-traditional-dance-in-pittsburgh/">first became involved in French dance</a> and also hoped to eventually play music at a workshop. Normally, I would jump at the opportunity to play for the next French dance workshop, taking up the main melody role on flute, but I simply anticipated being too busy to be involved in the next one coming up so soon, so I had to decline to join in. I hope that for the April workshop I&rsquo;ll have more time to commit to joining in, rehearsing, etc.</p>

<h2 id="blues-jam">Blues jam</h2>

<p>I was exhausted after two hours of the French jam and dance, plus I needed to get home as I promised Abby I would be home before she got back from being driven home from her mandolin practice, so I don&rsquo;t know how the blues jam went. Maybe next month I&rsquo;ll be able to check it out.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I had a great time further exploring French music and continuing to play with Lisa, John, and Allison, whom I&rsquo;ve played with several times now, getting to feel like a solid core group.</p>
