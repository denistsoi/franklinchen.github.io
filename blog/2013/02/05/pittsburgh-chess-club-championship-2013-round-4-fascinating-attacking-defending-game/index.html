<p>Round 4 of the annual <a href="http://pittsburghcc.org/">Pittsburgh Chess Club</a> Championship had me playing one of the most <em>fascinating</em> games I have played in my entire life. My opponent tried to wipe me off the board with a brute-force attack in the early moves of the opening and I managed to defend, but there were various subtleties involved. He engaged in <em>sacrifice</em> after sacrifice, not all sound, but all interesting.</p>

<h2 id="my-complete-annotated-game">My complete annotated game</h2>

<p>At your convenience, you can <a href="../../../../../chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05.htm">enjoy playing over the game with my annotations, including diagrams</a>.</p>

<p><strong>In fact, it is necessary to read the detailed annotations to get a full picture of all the best moves that neither player saw but existed.</strong></p>

<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>

<p>As I mentioned in <a href="../../../../../blog/2013/02/03/pittsburgh-chess-club-championship-2013-round-3-attack-defense-and-sacrifices/">my report on the previous round</a>, I knew that for today, I would face Peter Jansen (currently rated 1999), and that I know how he plays the openings. I knew that he tries to play solidly for a draw against stronger players, so I had to figure out a way to maximize my winning chances. I planned a particular <em>ultra-aggressive</em> opening as Black against him, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Defence">Dutch Defense</a>, the goal of which is avoid early contact while preparing to stake out a claim in the center as well as on the King side.</p>

<p>In particular, I remembered that some years ago, Peter had been White against Grandmaster <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Shabalov">Alexander Shabalov</a> (who is a four-time winner of the US Chess Championship, and also happens to live in Squirrel Hill in Pittsburgh) and Shabalov had used the Dutch as Black against him. (Actually, I had misremembered the occasion as a simultaneous exhibition; after our game, when I told Peter about my preparation, he said that the game had been an actual tournament game. I looked and verified that it was a <a href="http://www.uschess.org/assets/msa_joomla/XtblMain.php?200710142921.1-12533530">Pittsburgh Chess League game in 2007</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="overview-of-my-game">Overview of my game</h2>

<h3 id="the-opening">The opening</h3>

<p>Peter played <em>exactly</em> as I predicted he would, and we reached a position that I had concluded was fine for Black. After playing <code>h6</code> to kick White&rsquo;s Bishop, I fully expected a retreat and then a slow progression to an interesting middlegame:</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="../../../../../chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05_files/diag3FA63606B7AA25D9.gif" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Dutch after h6</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>Instead, Peter uncorked a series of remarkable disruptive sacrificial ideas!</p>

<p>First, he did not retreat the Bishop, but instead played <code>Qb3</code> exploiting the weakness of Black&rsquo;s <code>e6</code> and <code>f7</code> squares:</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="../../../../../chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05_files/diag3FA6361ECBBCF26C.gif" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Qb3</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>White&rsquo;s Bishop cannot be captured by Black. (See the annotations for details.) So I calmly developed with <code>Bg7</code>. Then Peter went totally wild with <code>h5</code>, which is not really sound, but is definitely <em>interesting</em>. Not only did he leave the Bishop unprotected, but he was sacrificing the <code>h</code> Pawn.</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="../../../../../chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05_files/diag3FA636625EE9729E.gif" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>h5</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>I calmly took the Pawn. He followed up with the wild <code>Nh4</code> that continued to offer the Bishop as a sacrifice while attacking Black&rsquo;s <code>g6</code> Pawn:</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="../../../../../chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05_files/diag3FA6366A23529BD6.gif" />
    
    
</figure>


<p>I did not take, but defended <code>g6</code> while also opening up a defense of the <code>e6</code> square. He then continued by sacrificing his Knight on <code>g6</code>.</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="../../../../../chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05_files/diag3FA6368FCF1D708B.gif" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Nxg6</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>This is not a true sacrifice, because he gets the Knight on <code>h5</code> in return. But the Bishop on <code>g5</code> is still being offered.</p>

<p>It turns out that this whole series of blows by White was unsound, and could have been refuted calmly by <code>Kf8</code>:</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="../../../../../chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05_files/diag3FA636A01EC713E7.gif" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Kf8 refutes attack</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>But I saw a related idea and did not play the correct refutation, so the game continued to be interesting rather than ending quickly. I played <code>d5</code>, which has a similar idea but has the drawback of allowing a good tactical save by White.</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="../../../../../chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05_files/diag3FA63697F6F24239.gif" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>d5</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>White could have used a tactic to win the Pawn on <code>d5</code> while saving his Bishop from being trapped by attacking Black&rsquo;s Knight on <code>g6</code>. Oops! But neither Peter nor I saw this resource, and he did not play it.</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="../../../../../chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05_files/diag3FA636D4EFF89295.gif" />
    
    
</figure>


<p>Instead, he played a completely unsound sacrifice <code>e4</code> that I could have punished by taking the Bishop on <code>g5</code>:</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="../../../../../chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05_files/diag3FA636DCB461BBCD.gif" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Black wins a piece for real</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>But in a collective hallucination, neither of us saw that the Bishop was in danger, because for so many moves up till <code>d5</code>, it was <em>not</em> in danger!</p>

<p>Instead, I opted to take the Pawn on <code>e4</code>.</p>

<h3 id="the-middlegame">The middlegame</h3>

<p>So White&rsquo;s opening attack finally came to an end, and we reached a middlegame in which Black has to get his King to safety but is one Pawn up. Objectively, the game is actually quite equal. I was happy to have reached this middlegame, after all the turmoil, not having seen the big refutations earlier.</p>

<p>After some natural moves, after which both sides were castled Queen side, I expected some kind of struggle on the King side in which White had pressure against Black&rsquo;s <code>h6</code> Pawn and possibly could regain it at some point.</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="../../../../../chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05_files/diag3FA6371A10D3B49F.gif" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Both castled</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>Instead, Peter <em>blundered</em> with another sacrifice, or <em>so I thought</em>. It turns out from extensive computer analysis that the sacrifice was actually <em>sound</em> and should have led to an equal position through some extremely fascinating play. Let me explain.</p>

<p>Peter played <code>Nxe4</code>, with the idea of regaining the piece after <code>Qf7</code>:</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="../../../../../chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05_files/diag3FA6372171D13561.gif" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Nxe4 sacrifice</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>



<figure >
    
        <img src="../../../../../chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05_files/diag3FA6372A607D57FB.gif" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Qf7</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>It turns out that White does <em>not</em> regain the piece, after Black defends (as I did) with <code>Qd6</code>:</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="../../../../../chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05_files/diag3FA637315E0F3046.gif" />
    
    
</figure>


<p>It turns out that White has a miraculously deep move <code>Ra5</code> that equalizes through threats on Black&rsquo;s King!! But neither of us saw this.</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="../../../../../chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05_files/diag3FA6373985E401F4.gif" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Ra5</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>Instead, Peter blundered straight into having his Queen trapped:</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="../../../../../chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05_files/diag3FA6378607BCA4C0.gif" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Queen trapped</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>The game was effectively over at this point.</p>

<h3 id="the-endgame">The endgame</h3>

<p>However, Peter kept playing, and we ended up going into an endgame that was clearly lost for him (being a piece down):</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="../../../../../chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05_files/diag3FA6379E1BCF7153.gif" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Lost endgame for White</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>The rest of the game is only worth looking at for its efficient technique.</p>

<p>Peter finally resigned after losing more and more material:</p>

        <img src="../../../../../chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05_files/diag3FA6CCA14DB3192E.gif" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>White resigned</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<h2 id="lessons-learned-from-my-game">Lessons learned from my game</h2>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t take for granted that your opponent will play in exactly the same style you&rsquo;ve seen for years.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t think I have ever <em>in my entire life</em> played a game in which I have been offered so many sacrifices. It is important to keep one&rsquo;s cool and try to figure out the truth of each one.</li>
<li>A sacrifice could be <em>sound</em>, yet not work because it is not followed up properly.</li>
<li>A sacrifice could be <em>unsound</em>, yet work because the defender fails to respond correctly.</li>
<li>It takes careful calculation to determine which sacrifices are sound and which are unsound, and we humans do not always see the full truth, but <em>computers</em> do.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-next">What next?</h2>

<p>For round 5 next week, I have White against fellow Expert Richard Edahl. He is doing pretty well in the tournament, considering that, as he mentioned when he entered the tournament, he has not played in a single chess tournament in <a href="http://main.uschess.org/msa/MbrDtlTnmtHst.php?10333784"><em>over twenty years</em></a>! So I expect an interesting fight. I have no idea how idea how he plays, so this will be new and exciting.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I give credit to Peter for completely surprising me by attacking and sacrificing aggressively for a win, totally contrary to how I&rsquo;ve usually seen him play. The result was a fascinating game.</p>
