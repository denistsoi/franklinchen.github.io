    <h1>The dilemma of how to descend the Cathedral of Learning once at the top</h1>
    

<p>Yesterday, right after I left one of the sessions of the <a href="http://www.music.pitt.edu/events/43rd-annual-jazz-seminar-concert130813">annual Pittsburgh Jazz Seminar</a> at the William Pitt Union, I immediately crossed the street to the Cathedral of Learning, in order to climb up to the 36th floor (I last climbed the Cathedral <a href="../../../../../blog/2013/10/29/an-early-start-on-cathedral-of-learning-stair-climbing/">three days ago</a>):</p>

<p>I took off my shoes, stuffed my jacket into my backpack, and went up at an &ldquo;easy&rdquo; pace, taking about nine minutes:</p>

<p>Then I faced the usual dilemma of how to get back down, except this time, the dilemma was magnified because of my time constraints: I really needed to get down and out <em>quickly</em>, in order to make it to an important appointment.</p>

<h2 id="choices-and-tradeoffs">Choices and tradeoffs</h2>

<h3 id="elevator-down">Elevator down</h3>

<p>One option is to take one of the elevators down. This is what I&rsquo;ve almost always done ever since doing the Cathedral of Learning stair climb.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, whether this is time-effective depends a lot on various factors, such as whether Pitt classes are being held, Pitt students are roaming around, or tourists are roaming around.</p>

<p>It turned out that Saturday afternoon is a bad time to be taking the elevator. There were hordes of students as well as tourists throughout the building, and especially the tourists at the top floor.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I had noticed on the ground floor earlier that some of the elevators were out of service.</p>

<p>Finally, <a href="../../../../../blog/2013/10/29/an-early-start-on-cathedral-of-learning-stair-climbing/">three days ago I had a bad experience with the elevator</a>.</p>

<h3 id="taking-the-stairs-down">Taking the stairs down</h3>

<p>The other option is to take the stairs back down, all the way. This option is one I take so rarely that I don&rsquo;t even remember when I last did it. I probably did it once earlier this year, but have no specific memory of it.</p>

<p>The drawback of taking the stairs down is the extra impact on the body.</p>

<p>But since I needed to descend as quickly as possible, I felt I had no choice but to take the stairs. In fact, I not only used the stairs, but ran down all the way.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t hard (thank you, gravity!), although it got boring and weird after a while, because it feels like forever going down 36 floors.</p>

<h2 id="the-day-after">The day after</h2>

<p>I thought everything was OK, but this morning, the day after, I woke up with a serious case of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_onset_muscle_soreness">DOMS</a>.</p>

<p>My <em>calves</em> were totally tight and trashed. Oops. Maybe I could have prevented this by stretching after running down yesterday, but I had no time, and had to make my appointment. Or maybe I just plain overdid things, not being conditioned at all to running down so many steps.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m suffering, but no permanent damage done, of course: I will be OK after a day or two.</p>

<h2 id="what-next">What next?</h2>

<p>So does this mean that the next time I climb the Cathedral, I will stick to the elevator?</p>

<p>Actually, <em>no</em>. I take the experience as a challenge:</p>

<ul>
<li>First, I want to defeat my sense of boredom going down, just as I&rsquo;ve managed to defeat it on the way up. I will find something meditative and aesthetic about the process of descending the steps.</li>
<li>Clearly my soreness showed that my calves were insufficiently conditioned. The solution to that is not to avoid running down the steps, but to <em>keep doing it</em>, in a smarter way. Therefore, my plan now is that on any final repetition of the Cathedral stair climb, I will take the stairs back down, rather than the elevator, regardless of elevator congestion concerns.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>An accidental case of trashed calves during a workout has led me to treat it as a learning experience and a challenge to overcome in the future.</p>
