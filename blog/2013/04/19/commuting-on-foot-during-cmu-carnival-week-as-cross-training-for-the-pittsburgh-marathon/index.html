    <h1>Commuting on foot during CMU Carnival week as cross-training for the Pittsburgh Marathon</h1>
    

<p>Last year, I reported on deciding to <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/04/16/one-week-of-commuting-on-foot-because-of-cmu-carnival/">walk to work and back home during CMU Carnival week in order to avoid the hassles of parking on campus</a>. This year, I decided to do this again, but with a twist.</p>

<p>I considered my commute to be a deliberate part of cross-training for the Pittsburgh Marathon.</p>

<h2 id="why-walk-instead-of-run">Why walk instead of run?</h2>

<p>You might think that I would just run to work and back home, but the logistics were too complicated because of clothing, laptop, and other issues. I ran in to work this week just one time; otherwise, I walked.</p>

<p>More important, I feel that walking is greatly underrated as a fitness activity. Here is one of many recent articles, for example, reporting that <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/04/study-walking-can-be-as-good-as-running/274738/">walking has many underrated health benefits</a>. Unfortunately, I think the tone of this article is part of the problem: the title is &ldquo;Study: walking can be as good as running&rdquo;, which is just sensationalist drivel. I don&rsquo;t see walking and running as competitors at all. They are just two different activities, with different benefits, really. High-intensity running, for example, does a lot that walking does not do. But walking is less stressful, is slower, takes more time to cover a particular distance, is more meditative and in many cases more sociable (since running paces differ more than walking paces). Both are great.</p>

<h2 id="total-mileage">Total mileage</h2>

<p>I ended up walking about 12 miles total more than I normally walk during the week. Note that this is less than the total of the distances between home and office because when I drive in to work, I have to walk the distance between the parking lot and the office.</p>

<h2 id="footwear-concerns-over-the-luna-sandals">Footwear: concerns over the Luna Sandals</h2>

<p>I took the opportunity to put more mileage onto my Luna Sandals, which I&rsquo;ve been wearing for all my running in recent weeks. I figured that the more time I spend on these minimalist sandals, the more prepared I will be for the sustained impact of running the whole Pittsburgh Marathon in them. Also, I needed more time to get used to the lacing system.</p>

<p>It turned out that the extra 12 miles on my feet really made a difference in how much more stress on my feet I felt during this training week: not just soreness in my soles, but also some issues with drying, cracking skin.</p>

<h3 id="cushioned-shoes">Cushioned shoes</h3>

<p>After yesterday, I decided I needed a break from all the walking, and so on Friday, I drove to work, parking on Circuit Road, and walking less than half a mile to my office from there, and in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rockport-Mens-Westshire-Oxford-Black/dp/B000VRUX54">Rockport Westshire casual shoes</a> rather than any minimalist shoes! I did this especially because of the <a href="../../../../../blog/2013/04/19/going-out-too-fast-yet-again-in-my-third-random-distance-run/">Random Distance Run I did in my Luna Sandals</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-mono">The Mono</h3>

<p>I also finally decided to order a pair of thicker Luna Sandals, the new <a href="http://www.lunasandals.com/products/37-mono">Mono</a>, which are 12 mm thick rather than the 7 mm of the Venado I&rsquo;m currently wearing:</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a review of these huaraches on <a href="http://birthdayshoes.com/luna-mono-huaraches-barefoot-sandals-review">Birthday Shoes</a>. I will almost certainly <em>not</em> be receiving these huaraches in time to break in and use in the Pittsburgh Marathon, but I expect to use them this summer for walking around in and longer runs.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>It was unexpected to me how much more fat burning and soreness for my feet the extra 12 miles of walking this week gave me. I had to eat more just to maintain my weight, and I was so ready to take a break from minimalist shoes. I did decide to order a thicker running sandal for future running and walking.</p>
