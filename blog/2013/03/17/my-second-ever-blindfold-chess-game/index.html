    <h1>My second ever blindfold chess game</h1>
    

<p>I spent much of the time at Henry&rsquo;s St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day party <a href="../../../../../blog/2013/03/17/finally-doing-some-latin-music-jamming-on-flute/">playing music</a>.</p>

<p>When I decided to take a break, I went to the chess room and thought I&rsquo;d just sit down and watch some of the kids play chess. I hadn&rsquo;t played any chess at one of these parties in a long time, because it&rsquo;s just too one-sided.</p>

<p>But it turned out that when I sat down, people were leaving the chess board. So  I said to Henry (who was also taking a break from music and socializing), &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll play you blindfolded!&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="blindfold-chess">Blindfold chess</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindfold_chess">Blindfold chess</a> is when someone plays a game of chess without having any sight of the board (or equivalent, e.g., touch). The game has to be played using only memory, no recording devices of any kind.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s actually a <a href="http://www.blindfoldchess.net/">recent book on blindfold chess</a> that I have not yet looked at.</p>

<h2 id="my-blindfold-game-with-henry">My blindfold game with Henry</h2>

<p>At one of Henry&rsquo;s parties last year, there actually was a blindfold game conducted, between Henry and one of the boys who regularly attends his parties with his family, Ari. Henry played blindfold, while Ari had sight of the board, and I took charge of moving the pieces. That game ended in a draw because although Henry was winning, he forgot where all of his pieces were at a critical point and stalemated young Ari! After that game, I had suggested that someday I would like to play a blindfold game again, having done so once back in around thirteen years ago, when I was in graduate school. In fact, by sheer coincidence, that first ever blindfold game was in the office of my classmate <a href="../../../../../blog/2013/03/17/finally-doing-some-latin-music-jamming-on-flute/">Andrej who was responsible for starting me on listening to Cuban music</a>!! (Curiously, I don&rsquo;t actually remember how my first blindfold chess game (with Andrej) turned out. I think we adjourned it at some point and did not continue it.)</p>

<p>Anyway, I played blindfold against Henry, who had sight of the board. I was nervous because unlike Ari, Henry is actually a seasoned tournament player (currently rated 1823), having actually drawn me in a rated game several years ago (with both of us being sighted).</p>

<p>My primary concern, not being trained at all in how to play blindfold chess effectively, was to make sure that I did not forget something that could lead to my quickly losing. So I decided to try to simplify. This, of course, meant reducing my own chances of winning.</p>

<h3 id="the-game">The game</h3>

<p>I don&rsquo;t remember all the moves in the game, but remember most of them and the most important positions.</p>

<p>I took White and won a Pawn out of the opening but then gave it back. Although I eventually acquired a clear advantage in the middle game, I decided to simplify rather than lose track of my pieces. This was an important position in which I was White, to move:</p>

        <h4>Middle game</h4>

<p>I ended up winning a Pawn going into a Rook and Pawn endgame, which was clearly supposed to be drawn:</p>

</figure>


<p>But I acquired some winning chances after a while. I squandered my best chance, as a result of starting to lose track of what pieces were where. It was unexpectedly difficult (without a deliberate attempt on my part at a system) to keep track of exactly where our Rooks and Kings were, since there was so much shuffling around. If I were playing blindfold again, I would come up with a simple system to remember this kind of information.</p>

<p>I had some other winning chances later, because of my active King, but as a result of some simplification, we finally reached a clearly dead drawn position:</p>

    <figcaption>
        <h4>Draw is imminent</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>The game ended when, after several more moves, I clearly could not make further progress and offered a draw, which Henry accepted.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I was pleased not to lose my second ever blindfold chess game, ha! Well, it was just a casual game late at a party, so neither Henry nor I were playing our best. In a real game, I would be very lucky to escape losing against a sighted Henry, I think.</p>
