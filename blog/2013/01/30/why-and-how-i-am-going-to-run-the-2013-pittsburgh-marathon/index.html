    <h1>Why and how I am going to run the 2013 Pittsburgh Marathon</h1>
    

<p>I surprised myself by deciding suddenly to run the <a href="http://pittsburghmarathon.com/">Pittsburgh Marathon</a> this year, 2013. This was not part of the plan when I was <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/12/31/why-i-went-frick-park-trail-running-in-snowfall-for-the-first-time-in-a-decade/">thinking about my running plans for 2013 a month ago</a>!</p>

<p>This will be my second Pittsburgh Marathon, because the last time I ran it was in 2003, and that was my first marathon ever. It was quite an ordeal to finish, because of a lot of rookie mistakes, but I made it.</p>

<p>Here I am in 2003 near the finish line (photo courtesy of my sister Linda):</p>

<p>So: why am I running the Pittsburgh Marathon again, <em>now</em>, ten years later? What do I hope to accomplish? And how?</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<h3 id="do-it-better">Do it better</h3>

<p>In 2003, I ran my first marathon for a variety of reasons, and trained in certain ways, had certain expectations. I will write in depth later about that first marathon, because one reason I am running the Pittsburgh Marathon again now is to <em>do everything better</em> this time, with the benefit of experience and new self-knowledge.</p>

<p>I want to:</p>

<ul>
<li>maintain a smart pace</li>
<li>finish strong</li>
<li>avoid leg muscle cramping</li>
<li>avoid foot blistering</li>
<li>conquer the hills</li>
</ul>

<p>In sharp contrast to my first marathon, I do <em>not</em> plan to race this marathon as fast as I can. That blew up on me, and I do not have the time or desire to maximize my marathon performance at this point in my life. I do want to run strong, but not maximally. So I am not almost certainly not going to run faster than I did ten years ago; I am specifically expecting to run <em>slower</em> but to have a <em>better</em> overall experience.</p>

<p>This will not be the second time I run a marathon distance; I have done that two or three times on my own while training for the <a href="../../../../../categories/rachel-carson-trail-challenge/">Rachel Carson Trail Challenge</a> and have also run just over a marathon distance in the annual Sammy&rsquo;s Birthday Run (a 6-hour ultra event) in 2006 and 2008. But those I did pretty slowly just for training and fun, in well over four hours. In the 2013 Pittsburgh Marathon, I&rsquo;d like to finish close to the completely arbitrary magic number of 4:00:00. This is very low priority compared to the other goals, but it&rsquo;s useful to have a little bit of ambition.</p>

<h3 id="experiment">Experiment</h3>

<p>Besides what I <em>know</em> now that I didn&rsquo;t, there are also things that I didn&rsquo;t know then and still don&rsquo;t know now, but have hypotheses about. So the experience will be an opportunity to test my hypotheses. In particular, the kind of exercise and diet I follow now different in various ways from ten years ago. I do a lot more core and strength training and less endurance training. So my main goal, in fact, is to run this marathon with relatively <em>low mileage</em>. Instead of spending huge amounts of time and energy banging out the miles in training, I want to try ways of getting in really high-quality training that will enable me to handle the marathon distance better and gut it out through strength.</p>

<h3 id="social">Social</h3>

<p>My first Pittsburgh Marathon experience had me running all alone. I did have support as far as my sister coming to town and my friend Nathaniel watching me and cheering me on at certain points along the course, but out there, I was alone.</p>

<p>This time, I decided not to do the marathon unless I had at least a friend or two joining me. I got my office mate John to sign up (he also did the marathon over a decade ago). <a href="http://www.runoverit.com/">Chris</a> is signed up for it, although he actually has yet to run his first marathon, which will be coming up in March. There are a bunch of others I also know who will be running. I guess when time comes, we&rsquo;ll figure out how our likely paces might coincide (or not).</p>

<h3 id="it-will-be-on-my-birthday">It will be on my birthday</h3>

<p>What can I say: it will be my very first race of any distance run <em>on my birthday</em>. I thought it would be amusing and cool to celebrate my birthday by running the Pittsburgh Marathon.</p>

<h3 id="discount">Discount</h3>

<p>As staff at CMU, I (and my office mate John) get a <a href="http://athletics.cmu.edu/fitness/fitkit2013">special discount for the Pittsburgh Marathon</a>. This explains why I registered today, right before the deadline!</p>

<p>In addition to the reduced registration fee, part of the deal is &ldquo;Special access to private finish line tent with gourmet food, private massages, and more!&rdquo; as well as 6 months free membership to the <a href="http://www.steelcityrrc.org/">Steel City Road Runners</a>. Not bad.</p>

<h4 id="update-of-2013-03-16">(Update of 2013-03-16)</h4>

<p>I should note that the Steel City Road Runners was formed in 2011. John and I had in fact attended its &ldquo;kick-off party&rdquo; on Tuesday, September 13, 2011 where we did a free training run, but we ended up not joining the club or participating further, since we were not planning to do the Pittsburgh Marathon in 2012.</p>

<h2 id="how">How?</h2>

<p>There isn&rsquo;t actually much time before the marathon (three months), so I have to be smart about training and try to avoid setbacks. Some things I need to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>immediately start extending the distance of my runs</li>
<li>continue core and strength training</li>
<li>keep up stair climbing and hill running</li>
<li>build up to some rigorous interval training</li>
<li>schedule long races to run in before the marathon</li>
<li>cut back on various commitments in the next three months</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="removing-chess">Removing chess</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already decided on one major activity I am going to cut out: after I finish the current Tuesday night chess tournament, the <a href="../../../../../blog/2013/02/04/pittsburgh-chess-club-championship-2013-round-3-attack-defense-and-sacrifices/">Pittsburgh Chess Club Championship</a>, I will take a break and not play in any more Tuesday night chess tournaments until possibly the fall (in summer I&rsquo;d rather be playing outside in the sun rather than hunched over a chess board indoors!).</p>

<p>Time and energy are limited. We can&rsquo;t do everything all the time. In fact, as things are, I have not even been able to play in the monthly <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~schach/ChessPA/ChessLeague/wpapcl.htm">Pittsburgh Chess League</a> team matches since <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/11/11/pittsburgh-chess-league-round-3-back-to-chess-after-a-month-off/">November</a>: in December I was occupied with <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/12/02/oblivion-obsession-time-to-start-playing-melodica/">music rehearsal</a>, and just now in January I was coming off a hard week during which I was <a href="../../../../../blog/2013/01/25/notes-on-exercising-while-sick-or-tired/">sick and overbooked</a>. I do hope to make it to the February team match.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m doing well in the Pittsburgh Chess Club Championship so far, with a perfect score in my first three rounds, so I hope I&rsquo;ll be able to say goodbye while winning it after another three rounds!</p>

<h3 id="footwear">Footwear</h3>

<p>Almost certainly I will wear my <em>worn-out and holey</em> pair of <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/08/28/five-reasons-we-just-stocked-up-on-vibram-fivefingers-kso-trek-shoes/">Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek shoes</a>. The reason is that I have <em>never</em> been blistered wearing these shoes, no matter the distance. The leather is really comfortable for me. And I will wear the worn-out pair rather than a newer pair because on the roads, I don&rsquo;t want the deeply lugged outsoles.</p>

<p>The other alternative I thought about was wearing huaraches such as my <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/09/30/running-my-10th-great-race-10k-obscene-but-in-a-good-way/">Xero Shoes that I wore in the Great Race 10K</a>. I will do some experiments in the spring running much longer distances than 10K in huaraches, but I am currently very skeptical about running an entire marathon in them.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m excited to be back for marathon running. I hope to have a stimulating adventure in the next three months as I train for and participate in the 2013 Pittsburgh Marathon!</p>
