    <h1>Primanti&#39;s and the Cathedral of Learning</h1>
    

<p>Today I was scheduled to do the <a href="../../../../../blog/2013/01/04/i-had-no-choice-but-to-barefoot-climb-the-cathedral-of-learning/">Cathedral of Learning stair climb again, two repetitions like last time</a>. Since I had stayed later at work than expected, I was hungry already, so I decided I would go do the two reps and then eat a lot of food.</p>

<p>John was still around at work too and he was interested in doing two reps for the first time (years ago we&rsquo;d periodically done one), so we went. We had a plan.</p>

<h2 id="two-reps">Two reps</h2>

<p>I did both reps barefoot this time, and with a fully stuffed backpack.</p>

<p>I decided to lead the way with a slightly slow pace, in order to guarantee we would go faster during the second rep. We saw two people in shorts doing reps also. Both John and I were in street clothing.</p>

<p>The first rep we did in 9:07 (on Friday, alone, I had done 9:02).</p>

<p>This time I timed the break, because this is actually important information for the future when comparing improvement. We took a random break of 10:42 before doing the second rep, which we did in 8:54 (at some point before floor 31, we had an opportunity to overtake the other two people, who were on their third rep, and so I decided to just kick it up a notch for the rest of the way up).</p>

<h2 id="my-progression-plan">My progression plan</h2>

<p>John liked going two steps up at a time, but I am still on one by one, because it&rsquo;s easier on my quads. My intuition tells me that a good cadence is important for efficiency, and until my quads are strong enough, I cannot keep a good cadence going up two steps at a time. Right now I&rsquo;m focusing on simply getting some endurance and efficiency, and increasing the number of reps. After maybe two or three weeks of this, I will work on powering up two steps at a time over maybe no more than ten floors at a time.</p>

<p>I was amused to see the man wearing one of the old Rachel Carson Trail Challenge T-shirts that I also have, from 2008 (when I was a volunteer, not a participant as I was in 2005-2007). Also, the woman said she had done the Fight for Air Climb last year and placed third in the women&rsquo;s division, I think.</p>

<h2 id="primanti-s">Primanti&rsquo;s</h2>

<p>Then we went to <a href="http://primantibros.com/">Primanti&rsquo;s</a> in Oakland, as planned. I stuffed myself with a huge roast beef sandwich, my usual order when I go there (just a couple of times a year).</p>

<p>I heard recently that Primanti&rsquo;s may be <a href="http://www.wpxi.com/news/news/local/primanti-bros-receives-investment-hopes-expanding-/nTmGP/">expanding nationwide</a>. Cool! Why should the Pittsburgh area be the only one privileged to enjoy the huge &ldquo;fully loaded&rdquo; sandwiches with fries and cole slaw inside?</p>
