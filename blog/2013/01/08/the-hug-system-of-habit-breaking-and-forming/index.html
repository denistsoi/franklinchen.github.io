    <h1>The hug system of habit breaking and forming</h1>
    

<p>Abby and I came up with a very useful way of dealing with a type of conflict in marriage that seems pretty common: that of one person being annoyed by the other&rsquo;s bad habit, and repeatedly, because the other person after being criticized promises to change but doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>The reason for the failure to change is not necessarily malice, of course. Just taking myself as an example, I reflected on which changes I have made during marriage and which I have not, and tried to understand why I might &ldquo;forget&rdquo; one thing and not another.</p>

<p>It turned out that the answer was usually surprisingly simple, and must reflect on human nature in general. When there is something annoying I do and Abby just goes relentlessly negative on me, I am <em>less</em> likely to actually correct my behavior, even if I grudgingly acknowledge that I should change it. But if she told me in a loving way, I was more likely to catch myself in the future in the relevant situation, and either do what she wanted or not do what she did not want me to do!</p>

<p>All I have said here also applies to the exact opposite situation when Abby annoys me and I harp on her. The more vocal I am, the more insistent, the less effective.</p>

<p>In retrospect, this was just as true when I was a child also. I suppose we all still have a little child inside of us.</p>

<h2 id="one-part-of-the-solution">One part of the solution</h2>

<p>There is no silver bullet for &ldquo;making people change&rdquo;, but the thing is to have them want to change and make it easy, rather than demand it. We are human, not robots.</p>

<p>It turns out that when I get a hug, at the same time as when being told gently of something that I should do, I am more likely to remember the task, and associate it with something positive, and actually do it. It seems that when I am yelled at, the effect is to actually associate the task with a negative memory and block it out of my consciousness.</p>

<p>Again, you could say, this is crazy childish behavior, that &ldquo;adults&rdquo; should just take responsibility and do the right thing. That&rsquo;s why Abby used to say and I used to say. It leads to an escalating arms race of &ldquo;I&rsquo;m better than you&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;hug system&rdquo; seems to work a lot better for us, we found out to our surprise. If it works with human nature and the other way doesn&rsquo;t, then theories about how we &ldquo;should&rdquo; know how to behave kind of don&rsquo;t matter. Results matter.</p>

<p>I wish I had known about this earlier. Unfortunately, the authoritarian way in which I was raised led me to internalize the psychologically dubious assumption that <em>tone doesn&rsquo;t matter; reasoning and truth and right matter, and it is the purely the job of the offender to do all the work</em>. I now totally disagree with that. <em>Tone matters, whether or not you believe it should.</em></p>

<p>The toilet seats are always down now at home, as well as a large number of other little things I now remember to do that I mysteriously did not before. Maybe in theory I should have been able to get this all working no matter whether I was getting yelled at or not. Maybe I&rsquo;m a weak, irrational husband, a sad excuse of a human being. Or maybe imperfection only needs a little bit of help to do a lot better.</p>
