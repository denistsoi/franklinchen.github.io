<p>Those of you who follow my blog know that I have been conflicted about voting, but go and do it anyway, <em>most of the time</em>, e.g., <a href="../../../../../blog/2011/11/08/i-dont-know-if-i-should-vote-but-i-did/">in November 2011 for the municipal election</a> and <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/11/06/i-decided-to-resign-myself-to-continue-voting/">in November 2012 for the general election</a>, when I felt there were some politicians very important to <em>vote against</em>.</p>

<h2 id="apathy-or-ignorance">Apathy or ignorance?</h2>

<p>In April 2012&rsquo;s general primary, however, I was sufficiently apathetic that I didn&rsquo;t bother voting, although Abby did. For that election, it seemed to me that the winners were all going to be obvious no matter what I did, and there were no close races where I really cared about who won. I feel that in the absence of an informed opinion, the only rational and moral thing to do is to stay out. It is <em>unfashionable</em> in our society to admit <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/29/the-power-of-i-dont-know/">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;</a>, but if I truly don&rsquo;t know, then I see no point in participating.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election">Primary elections</a> are particularly problematic for me, because I simply oppose the concept and also resent being forced to register for one of the two major American political parties.</p>

<h2 id="may-2013-municipal-primary-choosing-mayor">May 2013 municipal primary: choosing mayor!</h2>

<p>But this year&rsquo;s Democratic primary is <em>critical</em>, because it will basically determine who becomes the next <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_mayoral_election,_2013">mayor of Pittsburgh</a>, given that a Democrat will win in the general election in November. And since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Ravenstahl">Luke Ravenstahl</a> decided to step down, there is a possibility of <em>real change</em>.</p>

<p>So I was pretty excited to vote today to make a difference (I hope). This will be the first time I have voted for a <a href="http://triblive.com/politics/politicalheadlines/4052165-74/percent-mayor-turnout">mayoral candidate in a primary</a> in my 15 years as a Pittsburgh resident. For once there may be a crack in the rusty Democratic political machine here?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/local/neighborhoods-city/polls-open-for-primary-election-688496/">Voter turnout today has been crazy low</a>. There was no line whatsoever when I went to vote or when Abby went. I&rsquo;ve never participated in an election, I think, with such low turnout.</p>

<p><em>Maybe this low turnout will end up being a good thing</em>. If people choose not to vote because they don&rsquo;t have informed opinions, then it means that I and the surprisingly large number of people I know who also voted for the same guy I did will <em>win</em>! (That said, it&rsquo;s sad if <a href="http://www.pittsburghmagazine.com/Best-of-the-Burgh-Blogs/Pitt-Girl/June-2013/Why-You-Must-Vote-in-Pittsburghs-Mayoral-Election/">only 2 percent of us decide the mayor</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="media-coverage">Media coverage</h2>

<p>I avoided <em>most</em> media coverage of the election (hard to avoid everything completely, admittedly) until I had already voted. (Yes, that includes ignoring the basically meaningless &ldquo;endorsements&rdquo; of the <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/">Post-Gazette</a> and <a href="http://triblive.com/">Tribune-Review</a>.</p>

<p>Then I enjoyed reading <a href="http://www.pghcitypaper.com/Blogh/archives/2013/05/21/election-day-thoughts">this little look at what&rsquo;s been going on with the mayoral race</a>. And tomorrow I am back to ignoring the news.</p>

<p>Also, I had to recycle probably 30 or so paper flyers during election season. What a waste. And summarily delete dozens of robocalls on the answering machine. Note to everyone who sent me junk or left junk messages on my answering machine: <em>I did not read a single thing you sent, or listen to a single word you spoke; your junk only made me angry and at least partly less likely to vote for you, if I caught your name and remembered it</em>. <strong>Pathetic.</strong> I realize this crap works on some people, but I&rsquo;m afraid it doesn&rsquo;t work on me: I&rsquo;m not going to believe that your opponent eats children for breakfast, no matter what large fonts you use.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In a moment of relief from apathy and cynicism about politics, I eagerly voted today. I hope I&rsquo;ll get to see whether I was justified.</p>
