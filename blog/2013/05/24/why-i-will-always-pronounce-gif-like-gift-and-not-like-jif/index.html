    <h1>Why I will always pronounce &#34;GIF&#34; like &#34;gift&#34; and not like &#34;Jif&#34;</h1>
    

<p>Recently Steve Wilhite, the creator of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Interchange_Format">GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)</a>, tried to settle once and for all the age-old (well, 26-year-old, since the invention of GIF in 1987) question of how to pronounce &ldquo;GIF&rdquo;, claiming that it is <a href="http://howtopronouncegif.com/">pronounced as &ldquo;jif&rdquo;</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
"The Oxford English Dictionary accepts both pronunciations," Mr. Wilhite said. "They are wrong. It is a soft ‘G,’ pronounced ‘jif.’ End of story." 
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, whole &ldquo;debate&rdquo; is kind of silly, because it doesn&rsquo;t really matter how it&rsquo;s pronounced.</p>

<p><em>Or does it?</em></p>

<h2 id="my-first-memories-of-gif">My first memories of GIF</h2>

<p>I was in college in the late 1980s when a friend of mine first introduced me to the world of GIF files. Since he pronounced &ldquo;GIF&rdquo; like &ldquo;gift&rdquo;, I followed suit. Other friends also pronounced it that way, and I simply assumed that was &ldquo;correct&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="mispronunciation">Mispronunciation?</h2>

<p>It was in the early 1990s when at my first job, I noticed that a colleague of mine pronounced &ldquo;GIF&rdquo; like &ldquo;Jif&rdquo; instead. I was stunned, of course. Meanwhile, at this very time, there was an uproar over the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Interchange_Format#Unisys_and_LZW_patent_enforcement">patent enforcement by Unisys on the LZW compression algorithm used by GIF</a>. I was outraged by the development myself, and chose to <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/gif.html">minimize use of the GIF format</a>; I used JPEG and the new PNG formats instead for any new image file creation.</p>

<p>It was around this time that I learned that the official pronunciation of &ldquo;GIF&rdquo; was supposed to be &ldquo;jif&rdquo;.</p>

<p><em>But I didn&rsquo;t care.</em></p>

<p>I knew that there were people pronouncing it either way, and I was already used to one way, and nobody was enforcing the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; way, and I was rarely even saying the word any more, since I was not using the file format for personal or work purposes. In the past two decades, I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve said the word more than a dozen times, but each time, I stubbornly used the &ldquo;gift&rdquo; pronunciation.</p>

<h2 id="ownership">Ownership?</h2>

<p>If everyone were saying &ldquo;jif&rdquo; all the time, I would have changed my pronunciation. This is how language works. The point of language is to communicate with others, and if nobody knew what I was saying because I was pronouncing a word wrong, then I would have to change my pronunciation.</p>

<p><em>It means little to me what the inventor of the word intended</em>, because language serves everyone who uses it meaningfully, not just the inventor.</p>

<p><strong>When you create something, you don&rsquo;t own it any more. It belongs to the world.</strong></p>

<p>This is considered by some to be a controversial point of view, but I think it is philosophically correct <em>as a starting point</em> of discussion. Yes, sophisticated systems of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_rights_%28economics%29">property rights</a> have been created and do serve a useful purpose, but always <em>in context of</em> the fundamental outlook, and as a constraint in the name of greater benefit to society.</p>

<p>The continuing debates over American copyright and patent laws, for example, illustrate that these laws are not set in stone but are a result of discussions and compromises among different interests and philosophies.</p>

<p>It is ironic, of course, that more people seem to care about the pronunciation of &ldquo;GIF&rdquo; than about the old patent controversy surrounding the format. Then again, as a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/patent">limited monopoly</a>, the patent on LZW did expire in the US in 2003 (and elsewhere in 2004).</p>

<h2 id="ownership-of-language">Ownership of language?</h2>

<p>If you are reading this and are French, I&rsquo;m curious what your view is of ownership of language, because the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acad%C3%A9mie_fran%C3%A7aise">Académie française</a> has officially controlled the French language since 1635, and there is no analogous institution in the US.</p>

<h2 id="authorial-intent">Authorial intent?</h2>

<p>The debate over &ldquo;GIF&rdquo; may seem trivial, but I think it is a good starting point for those who are interested in issues of ownership and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorial_intent">authorial intent</a>, as applied to many more important issues, such as &ldquo;correct&rdquo; interpretation or use of literature, of music, of law. I have been particularly interested in this debate in the context of music, and my attitude comes from grappling with <a href="../../../../../blog/2012/12/10/rip-charles-rosen/">Charles Rosen&rsquo;s writings</a> over the years; as you can imagine, debate over &ldquo;composer&rsquo;s intent&rdquo; can get <a href="http://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php?topic=2657.0">very heated</a>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Dictionaries of English today accept both pronunciations of &ldquo;GIF&rdquo;. Furthermore, some informal polls I have seen even come up with the result that most people who participate in such polls favor my pronunciation. So I will continue using my pronunciation.</p>

<p>But really, <a href="http://stancarey.wordpress.com/2013/05/24/you-can-pronounce-gif-any-way-you-like/">it doesn&rsquo;t matter how you pronounce &ldquo;GIF&rdquo;</a>. The existence of alternate pronunciations of words is not a threat to language. &ldquo;Either&rdquo;, &ldquo;tomato&rdquo;, &ldquo;GIF&rdquo;: let&rsquo;s call the whole thing off!</p>
