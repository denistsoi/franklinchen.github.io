      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love medicine balls. But once upon a time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know what a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine_ball&#34;&gt;medicine ball&lt;/a&gt; was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two months ago, I mentioned my gradual movement away from formal gyms and exercise machines toward &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/17/the-joys-of-convict-conditioning-bodyweight-exercising/&#34;&gt;less technological ways to exercise&lt;/a&gt;. One of the &amp;ldquo;gadgets&amp;rdquo; I do use is a medicine ball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I am reviewing an intense exercise video that I started using just two years ago that involves a medicine ball, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Gaiam-05-52846-Fit-Ball-Workout/dp/B0012K1BM8&#34;&gt;Gaiam Fit Ball Workout&lt;/a&gt; with instructor &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tanjadjelevic.com/&#34;&gt;Tanja Djelevic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I give this &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; stars&lt;/strong&gt; and here&amp;rsquo;s why!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-m-reviewing-the-first-workout-only-for-now&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m reviewing the first workout only, for now&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am only reviewing the first workout on the DVD, the &amp;ldquo;fit ball workout&amp;rdquo;. I have never done the other two workouts, the &amp;ldquo;abs workout&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;partner workout&amp;rdquo;. I happen not to be a fan of abs-specific workouts (a later blog post will explain why), and I have yet to ask Abby whether she is interested in trying the partner workout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;equipment-which-medicine-ball&#34;&gt;Equipment: which medicine ball?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, I started out with the 4 pound medicine ball and to my surprise, found myself humbled by it initially (after having spent too many years not working my upper body). Eventually the 4 pound ball became too easy and I bought a 6 pound ball, which I use now. I would advise starting easy and building up, making sure that whatever weight you are using, you only use a weight that you can sustain with good form for 25 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no points for &amp;ldquo;showing off&amp;rdquo; and handling a heavier ball with poor form. There are also no points for going through the motions with a ball that is far too light to offer the resistance and burn you want to feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m at the point where the 6 pound ball is a bit easy for some parts of the workout and still challenging for others. So I should probably move to an 8 pound ball soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;instructor&#34;&gt;Instructor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tanja Djelevic is a fantastic instructor. Her instructions and suggestions and reminders on form are quite clear and enthusiastic, without being annoying. I cannot overstate how important it is, when evaluating an exercise video, to make sure the instructor is someone you can really feel reaching out to you from the TV or computer screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-movements-full-range-of-motion&#34;&gt;The movements: full range of motion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;fit ball workout&amp;rdquo; is 25 minutes of nonstop intensity with a lot of different movements. I like that it works a full range of motion for many muscles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are reaches for the arms that I feel improved my posture and flexibility and aligned my shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are core twists that should be done with care (I once did such twists carelessly and hurt my back).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lunges and plies that will have you feeling the burn in your quads, glutes, and calves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figure-eights and circles for the arms while holding the ball are great for shoulders and surrounding muscles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The throws are explosive and one of the great things about using a medicine ball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wood chops with the medicine ball I enjoy a lot, very dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pushups are, well, pushups, but with an interesting dimension: by rolling the ball from one side to another while doing pushups, you get to work on core stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plank and other stationary poses are good for the abs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;warmup-and-cooldown&#34;&gt;Warmup and cooldown&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The warmup and cooldown are all too brief for my taste, but are decent if extended on both ends by a longer warmup and a longer cooldown (with more stretching of all the leg muscles, especially).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the 25-minute medicine ball workout periodically over the past two years has not only added muscle to my entire upper body, and expanded my chest, but also improved my posture, balanced my left and right sides of my body, and generated some weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a workout I would do every day or even every other day. The reason is that doing the workout as is (without modification) involves endurance levels of repetition that I find beneficial in small doses but unenjoyable and less beneficial in larger doses. I like to mix up my workouts so that I get sessions in which I move much heavier weight but with fewer reps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried out other videos by Tanja Djelevic and will review them in the future. You might want to check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://tanjadjelevic.com/blog/&#34;&gt;her blog&lt;/a&gt; and subscribe to it: she likes talking about the whole picture of health of mind and body. Exercise isn&amp;rsquo;t and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be some kind of mechanical operation treating the body as a machine. It&amp;rsquo;s something joyful that taps into our being fully alive, and you can tell from her instruction that Tanja embodies this attitude, and I appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Joys of Convict Conditioning: Bodyweight Exercising</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/10/17/the-joys-of-convict-conditioning-bodyweight-exercising/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent the vast majority of my life completely, utterly sedentary. Let&amp;rsquo;s put it this way: I was on the phone with my father yesterday and he said he went to some free senior citizen fitness program in a mall and ended up getting sweaty, and seemed concerned. I said, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m glad you got some good exercise!&amp;rdquo; In other words, I was raised to never get sweaty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when I neared age 30, and was getting heavier and heavier, and almost certainly going &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediabetes&#34;&gt;prediabetic&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to completely change my life. I took up &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/running/&#34;&gt;running&lt;/a&gt;, karate, dancing, and weight lifting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I always ended up having trouble with was weight lifting. I&amp;rsquo;d go to the gym and mess around with the machines since they were there, but although I built up some muscle, the whole process was boring, I never felt like I was really accomplishing anything, and I felt out of whack. It took years of trial and error to come to some sort of strength training regimen that I actually enjoyed and felt really benefited me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably my first step out of the confusing world of strength training was the book &lt;a href=&#34;http://store.coreperformance.com/store/Products/Core-Performance-Book__AP-BOOK.aspx&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Core Performance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I still find the advice and exercises from the book tremendously useful, and highly recommend checking out the tips and videos free at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.coreperformance.com/&#34;&gt;Core Performance web site&lt;/a&gt;. (I will blog more about Core Performance in the future.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I found that when pressed for time, I would not necessarily be in the mood to get to my balance ball and free weights and do exactly what was in Core Performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I gravitated toward a whole philosophy of &amp;ldquo;exercise anywhere, anytime, with no equipment necessary&amp;rdquo; that removes all excuses and mental friction. Welcome to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dragondoor.com/shop-by-department/books/b41/&#34;&gt;convict conditioning&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-goals&#34;&gt;My goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let&amp;rsquo;s get straight what my goals are when it comes to strength training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not a goal&lt;/strong&gt;: getting big muscles, getting ripped. I&amp;rsquo;m a bit surprised by how many of my male friends are obsessed with getting ripped. A while ago I saw an interesting article discussing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.freakonomics.com/2011/07/27/culture-bound-syndromes-run-amok/&#34;&gt;this obsession&lt;/a&gt;. Anyway, I have no goal of getting ripped (maybe because of my Asian cultural heritage, as suggested in the article), plus it is not possible for me anyway without steroids or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal&lt;/strong&gt;: to feel fit, feel strong, and &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; strong: i.e., so I can do reasonable things like lift and throw and punch and break a fall, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-convict-conditioning&#34;&gt;What is convict conditioning?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Convict conditioning basically refers to what one can do if, say, one were in jail and had no access to any particular equipment and wanted to get functionally strong, to do what is necessary to survive in such an environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, I don&amp;rsquo;t plan on being in such a grim survival environment, but I like the minimalist idea of making do with what one has, and not being dependent on any gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I found that once I started trying to really do pushups, pullups, and squats, they are &lt;em&gt;amazingly hard&lt;/em&gt;. I mean, it&amp;rsquo;s one thing just mechanically choosing weights at a gym and going through fixed motions with them, but it&amp;rsquo;s another thing being faced with your own body weight and realizing that you are naked, asking, &amp;ldquo;What can I do with my very body?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate to sound mystical or something, but it&amp;rsquo;s like the distinction between subject and object blurs, and also the whole &amp;ldquo;isolating muscles&amp;rdquo; mentality disappears (which Core Performance started me on the path out of). I believe our bodies and minds are whole, and should work entirely in concert, not in isolation. So taking up bodyweight exercises seriously is, in the end, even a philosophical statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not saying that we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t also take advantage of machines and gadgets (in fact, I still find balance balls, medicine balls, rowing machines, etc. to be useful). I&amp;rsquo;m just saying that I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; enjoy exercise when away from all that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-detour-concerning-inactivity-and-exercise&#34;&gt;A detour concerning inactivity and exercise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve come to believe that it is totally unnatural to compartmentalize one&amp;rsquo;s life the way I once did: sitting down working much of the day and then allocating some discrete block of time for exercise in some special location (home or gym).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.timferriss.com/&#34;&gt;Tim Ferriss&lt;/a&gt; and his long-running &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; and his recent book &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fourhourbody.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 4-Hour Body&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as well as sources from the whole broad &lt;a href=&#34;http://robbwolf.com/&#34;&gt;paleo&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.marksdailyapple.com/&#34;&gt;primal&lt;/a&gt; diet and lifestyle, and hearing about the research showing how bad it is to be &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.geekosystem.com/sitting-health-dangers/&#34;&gt;sitting&lt;/a&gt; for an extended period at all, I&amp;rsquo;ve made sure to take frequent breaks away from my computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When taking a break, I might just walk to get some water or stretch, but now that I know of the benefits of intermittent sprints of intense activity, convict conditioning becomes even more relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;practical-advantages-of-bodyweight-exercising&#34;&gt;Practical advantages of bodyweight exercising&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a practical point of view, pushups, pullups, and squats are great because I can do them almost anywhere, anytime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will often just get down on the floor at work or at home, and do various forms of pushups, or squats. That gets the blood flowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pullups are trickier, because although I have tried doing them by grasping onto the top of my office door frame at work, it&amp;rsquo;s painful and unreliable.  However, at home, I have on the frame of one entryway a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.doorgym.net/&#34;&gt;Door Gym&lt;/a&gt; pullup bar, which I use at random times when passing through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, bodyweight exercising comes in handy also when traveling, or attending some all-day conference or other such event. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to go hide somewhere momentarily and do a bunch of pushups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I have found in the past year that just doing a few seconds of intense activity to boost my metabolism before eating has a noticeable effect in decreasing my fat percentage. This stuff works!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;progress&#34;&gt;Progress&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pullups have always been really hard for me, but as of today, to my surprise, I&amp;rsquo;m finally up to eight reps from a dead hang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still am nowhere near doing a single one-arm pullup or pushup. I love a challenge. We&amp;rsquo;ll see when I get there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
