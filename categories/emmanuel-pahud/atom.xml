      <title>Happy 300th birthday, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach: still underappreciated after all these years!</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;So, today is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/2014/03/08/267603200/a-kid-named-carl-stirs-up-the-bach-musical-dynasty&#34;&gt;300th birthday&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Philipp_Emanuel_Bach&#34;&gt;CPE Bach&lt;/a&gt;, one of the sons of the much more famous Johann Sebastian Bach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you&amp;rsquo;re a Western art music history buff, or are specifically interested in the Baroque and Classical eras, you may not even have heard of CPE Bach, which is somewhat ironic because he was actually more well-known and respected in his day than his father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this composer so little recognized today? What is fascinating is that he so much influenced other composers who respected him, such as Mozart and Beethoven, but himself has kind of faded in public awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is such a huge difference between Johann Sebastian Bach&amp;rsquo;s music, which is so well-known now, and that of his son Carl Philipp Emanuel. The son&amp;rsquo;s music was &lt;em&gt;radical&lt;/em&gt; at the time, going completely against his father&amp;rsquo;s style. He privileged bizarreness, extremes of emotion, restlessness. You get the feeling that it was experimental, and it still feels that way today. I think that history does not know what to do with someone whose life work was so relentlessly experimental.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sonata-in-a-minor-for-solo-flute&#34;&gt;Sonata in A minor for solo flute&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To celebrate CPE Bach&amp;rsquo;s birthday, I made another attempt at reading through his sonata in A minor for solo flute, the second movement of which &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/07/28/my-first-appearance-on-a-music-recital-program/&#34;&gt;I performed almost two years ago at a party&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, I was uncomfortable with how to interpret the first, slow movement, not knowing what to do with this very free music, but now, I feel liberated and happy to play this first movement, the way that I &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; it in the moment. I&amp;rsquo;d like to think that CPE Bach would have approved the evolution of my emotional openness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also rewatched a fine video performance of the final Allegro movement of this sonata, by Emmanuel Pahud:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/SeGcyPu-hNY&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no clip to share of the first movement because I don&amp;rsquo;t like any of the performances I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to find online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-i-originally-discovered-cpe-bach-freie-fantasie-in-f-sharp-minor&#34;&gt;How I originally discovered CPE Bach: Freie Fantasie in F-sharp minor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to confess how I originally discovered CPE Bach in the first place. It happened in college, when I would regularly browse the &amp;ldquo;new recordings&amp;rdquo; section of one of the campus libraries. One day I spotted on the shelf a CD by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.andreas-staier.de/&#34;&gt;Andreas Staier&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.allmusic.com/album/cpe-bach-sonatas-fantasies-mw0001969795&#34;&gt;selected CPE Bach sonatas and fantasies&lt;/a&gt;. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know the first thing about CPE Bach at that point, other than that he was a son of Johann Sebastian. But I noticed that the CD advertised that not only a harpsichord, but also a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortepiano&#34;&gt;fortepiano&lt;/a&gt; was used in the recording. I wanted to hear some fortepiano playing, so I checked out the CD. Up till then, I had only seen and heard the fortepiano once before, played by my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.workspacestrategies.com/bio.html&#34;&gt;music TA&lt;/a&gt; during a section meeting of a music appreciation course I took freshman year, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/11/09/taking-up-flute-again-after-decades/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Piano Music of the 19th Century&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, when she played sections of a Brahms intermezzo on the instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out the fortepiano was used for a particular piece on the album that caught my fancy, the Freie Fantasie (free fantasy) in F-sharp minor, which he himself titled &amp;ldquo;CPE Bachs Empfindungen&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;CPE Bach&amp;rsquo;s feelings&amp;rdquo;. As you might expect, this is a really personal, expressive piece, and I still remember finding it bewildering and bewitching in its strange harmonic changes and emotional gestures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the miracle of YouTube, you can actually listen to the exact recording that I first discovered a quarter of century ago by Andreas Staier, right here. I&amp;rsquo;ve set it to start playing at the beginning of this piece, since the entire video is actually the whole album (which is quite worth listening to, because of the brilliant harpsichord playing of the other pieces). The piece lasts from 38:35 to 49:15, just over ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/Yy9MfX1mQs0?t=38m35s&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have heard other performances of this piece but I still think Staier&amp;rsquo;s is the best, in his really getting into the improvisational and free spirit of the fantasy. By the way, I recommend Staier&amp;rsquo;s recordings of all kinds of keyboard works before and after CPE Bach: I love everything I have heard from him, from Johann Sebastian Bach to Schubert. For example, here he is live, playing Schubert on a fortepiano. Check out the fantastical outburst that is part of this sonata movement (starting around 3:04).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/TE4RNdwrWxM&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t explored the music of CPE Bach, please take advantage of the &amp;ldquo;publicity&amp;rdquo; of his 300th birthday to check out some of his work. It still sounds daring and bold today.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My first bobblehead doll: guess who?</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/09/20/my-first-bobblehead-doll-guess-who/</link>

      <description>&lt;figure &gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I now own my first &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobblehead&#34;&gt;bobblehead doll&lt;/a&gt;! Abby was reluctant to let me take him home, but I argued that he would inspire me in the playing of his music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;pittsburgh-music-alliance-launch-party&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Music Alliance launch party&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;about&#34;&gt;About&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://pittsburghmusicalliance.org/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Music Alliance&lt;/a&gt; had a launch party that Abby and I attended, held at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.contemporarycraft.org/&#34;&gt;Contemporary Craft&lt;/a&gt; in the Strip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pittsburgh Music Alliance is a new collaboration of five Pittsburgh music organizations for the purpose of increasing their audience:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bachchoirpittsburgh.org/&#34;&gt;Bach Choir of Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pittsburghcamerata.org/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Camerata&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chathambaroque.org/&#34;&gt;Chatham Baroque&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rbsp.org/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Renaissance and Baroque&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pittsburghchambermusic.org/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Chamber Music Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find more information on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/PittsburghMusicAlliance&#34;&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;food-and-information-tables&#34;&gt;Food and information tables&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/189232_472125132808229_857638441_n.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Food and tables&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As we wandered around at the party, we sampled the food and checked out the tables of the five organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(There are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.472125112808231.106189.197956923558386&amp;amp;type=3&#34;&gt;photos of the party here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;live-music&#34;&gt;Live music&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/199595_10151047722351513_1243992903_n.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Recorder quartet&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We arrived in time to see my &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/recorder/&#34;&gt;recorder&lt;/a&gt; friends perform as a recorder quartet, playing a variety of selections. Fred, Helen, Mike, and Annie were delightful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, members of the five music organizations took turns performing for us. Unfortunately, the acoustic situation was quite poor amidst the party conversations going on everywhere, but I enjoyed watching the people who sang and played for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-bobbleheads&#34;&gt;The bobbleheads&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw approximately ten bobbleheads, each in its unopened box, sitting around. I got very excited. It turned out that they were being given away. I secretly always wanted one since seeing my friend Henry with one on top of his piano; he had one of Beethoven:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/beethoven-bobblehead.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Beethoven bobblehead&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;By the bobbleheads, there was a sheet saying something like, &amp;ldquo;Name a piece I wrote and you can take me home.&amp;rdquo; It seemed that nobody was really enforcing this, but when I offered to take one, I said the bobblehead would help me as I worked on the composer&amp;rsquo;s [flute sonatas]().&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes-on-johann-sebastian-bach-s-flute-sonatas&#34;&gt;Notes on Johann Sebastian Bach&amp;rsquo;s flute sonatas&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The composer whose bobblehead I got was, of course, &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/johann-sebastian-bach/&#34;&gt;Johann Sebastian Bach&lt;/a&gt;, a hero of mine in the past year during which I&amp;rsquo;ve gradually fallen in love with Baroque music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-instrument&#34;&gt;What instrument?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am faced with a conundrum when trying to play Bach&amp;rsquo;s flute sonatas: &lt;em&gt;what instrument should I use to play this music?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of his son, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Philipp_Emanuel_Bach&#34;&gt;CPE Bach&lt;/a&gt;, two months ago in a recital &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/07/28/my-first-appearance-on-a-music-recital-program/&#34;&gt;I played a movement of CPE Bach&amp;rsquo;s solo flute sonata&lt;/a&gt; using a modern flute. I feel that the nature of CPE Bach&amp;rsquo;s music, more dramatic and agitated, makes the modern flute a reasonable instrument for the piece; I feel that it is definitely reasonable to play the music on a Baroque flute instead, but that I actually prefer it on modern flute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plus, CPE Bach&amp;rsquo;s music is much easier to play on modern flute.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Johann Sebastian Bach&amp;rsquo;s flute sonatas, although I prefer them on Baroque flute than to modern flute, are much harder to play on Baroque flute. It turns out that I dislike almost all recordings I&amp;rsquo;ve come across of this music on modern flute, with one exception: the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pahudbach.com/&#34;&gt;recordings&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/emmanuel-pahud/&#34;&gt;Emmanuel Pahud&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-decision&#34;&gt;My decision&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve made an unpleasant decision. I work on the slow, easy movements of the flute sonatas on Baroque flute, and I don&amp;rsquo;t currently work on the harder movements at all. I&amp;rsquo;m still far worse on Baroque flute than on modern flute, and those fast movements are beyond me on Baroque flute. And I don&amp;rsquo;t really want to play the music on modern flute. This is just my personal choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a great time at the Pittsburgh Music Alliance season launch party. It was inspiring to see my recorder friends playing, and to see others in the early music community performing with enthusiasm. (Seeing people singing as an ensemble even got me thinking about getting into that sometime maybe.) If you enjoy fresh, vital performances of early music, check out the five organizations mentioned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I&amp;rsquo;m grateful to now be the proud owner of a Johann Sebastian Bach bobblehead doll. Every time I see him, I remember that I must play his music with verve and soul, because he&amp;rsquo;s watching.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>James Galway made me hate flute, but Emmanuel Pahud made me love it</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/11/22/james-galway-made-me-hate-flute/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Nov 2011 22:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/11/22/james-galway-made-me-hate-flute/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;rsquo;s been less than two weeks since I &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/11/09/taking-up-flute-again-after-decades/&#34;&gt;started playing flute again&lt;/a&gt;. One thing I forgot to mention is that &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Galway&#34;&gt;James Galway&lt;/a&gt; made me hate flute for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that I never liked Galway&amp;rsquo;s distinctive vibrato and sound. Unfortunately, for some reason, I kept on seeing him on TV and hearing him on the radio, and so he sort of represented to me &amp;ldquo;flute&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-of-2013-08-23&#34;&gt;(Update of 2013-08-23)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have periodically received comments from people very unhappy with my dislike of the playing of James Galway. I mean no disrespect: everyone has different taste. I should add that I actually love and respect James Galway as a musician and as an educator. I will write a detailed blog post about that at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;revival-through-jazz&#34;&gt;Revival through jazz&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, I started to enjoy hearing the flute again mainly from getting into jazz. I loved hearing &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbie_Mann&#34;&gt;Herbie Mann&lt;/a&gt; on flute, for example, and others as well. In fact, my original intention when buying a flute several years ago was to get into jazz flute: I had sort of lost interest in playing classical music by then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;discovery-of-emmanuel-pahud&#34;&gt;Discovery of Emmanuel Pahud&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;syrinx&#34;&gt;Syrinx&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a couple of years ago, I was driving and listening to the local classical radio station, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wqed.org/fm/&#34;&gt;WQED&lt;/a&gt;, when I was put totally under a spell by a performance of a work for solo flute. Being completely unfamiliar with the classical flute repertoire, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what the piece was, but the announcer said it was &amp;ldquo;Syrinx&amp;rdquo; by Claude Debussy, and performed by one &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Pahud&#34;&gt;Emmanuel Pahud&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went and found CDs by Pahud at the library. Great stuff! He is definitely my flute hero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a beautiful video of Pahud performing &amp;ldquo;Syrinx&amp;rdquo; on YouTube:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/aw53VrbI4l0&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;update-of-2013-08-23-1&#34;&gt;(Update of 2013-08-23)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/08/23/celebrating-claude-debussys-151st-birthday-through-unusual-performances-of-syrinx/&#34;&gt;I wrote for Debussy&amp;rsquo;s 151st birthday a note on unusual performances of Syrinx.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;entr-acte-from-carmen&#34;&gt;Entr&amp;rsquo;acte from Carmen&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that today I was practicing an arrangement of the Entr&amp;rsquo;acte from Bizet&amp;rsquo;s Carmen from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.musicminusone.com/used-play-flute-innovative-method-adults-returning-play-p-60414222.html&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;I Used to Play Flute&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; book, and out of curiosity, looked up Pahud on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here he is playing it under the young Venezuelan superstar conductor &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustavo_Dudamel&#34;&gt;Gustavo Dudamel&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/eChLCFAGyx0&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very nice, although his interpretation differs in various ways from my personal conception of the Entr&amp;rsquo;acte: I would play it faster and more passionately. One reason I feel compelled to play music, and not only listen to it, is that nobody ever plays a piece just how I would play it. To &lt;em&gt;live&lt;/em&gt; music, I must create it or recreate it afresh. To not do so would be like watching a video of a hike rather than being on the trail hiking and experiencing it.&lt;/p&gt;
