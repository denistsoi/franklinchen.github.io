&lt;p&gt;A year ago I dashed off an &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/05/i-cannot-imagine-my-life-without-the-influence-of-steve-jobs/&#34;&gt;emotional blog post upon learning of the death of Steve Jobs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three weeks later, I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/27/why-i-am-not-reading-the-biography-of-steve-jobs/&#34;&gt;my last note on Steve Jobs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, having ignored basically all media coverage of Steve Jobs since last October, and still ignoring the biography, all I have to say is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Let the dead bury the dead.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Why I am not reading the biography of Steve Jobs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been surprised by how many people recently have been asking me if I am reading Walter Isaacson&amp;rsquo;s much-anticipated biography of Steve Jobs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://d28hgpri8am2if.cloudfront.net/book_images/cvr9781451648539_9781451648539.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Cover of Walter Isaacson&amp;#39;s biography of Steve Jobs&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is that many occurrences of this question of me are obviously just small talk, because other than on my blog and to a few people directly, I have never expressed publicly my deep admiration for Steve Jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My answer is a firm &lt;strong&gt;No&lt;/strong&gt;, but I don&amp;rsquo;t explain why because it&amp;rsquo;s just small talk, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some reasons, outside of the confining scope of small talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;overexposure&#34;&gt;Overexposure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right after Steve Jobs died, there was an explosion of articles and blog posts about him online. I only read a tiny fraction of what appeared, but even then, that was a lot. After a week, I was mostly done with wanting to see any more. I didn&amp;rsquo;t believe I would learn anything substantially new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it hard to believe that Isaacson&amp;rsquo;s biography has any additional information, after all the time since Jobs&amp;rsquo; death, that would help me better understand Steve Jobs and his life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;biographies-in-general&#34;&gt;Biographies in general&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a child, I was fascinated by biographies and enjoyed seeking out reading brief child-oriented biographies of people like George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Abraham Lincoln. (I was especially obsessed with &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathanael_Greene&#34;&gt;Nathanael Greene&lt;/a&gt; and his campaigns during the American Revolution.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I got older, I realized that a lot of details were left out of biographies, and often even false myths were included, such that biographies were inherently a matter of reconstruction, interpretation, and even pure imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the purpose of reading a biography is to get close to knowing what really happened and why, then that is naive. At best, one can get some interesting snapshots and a point of view. There are always dozens of biographies of any celebrity. Which one to trust?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the purpose is to find out how to emulate actions or habits of an individual in order to replicate the success that individual had, I think that is fairly naive also. We know that there is always a lot of luck involved in success, and specific contexts in which someone gets to thrive. For example, a lot of music conductors got their big break filling in for a conductor who was sick. Do I really need to wade through a whole biography in order to learn that being available as a substitute is a good way to take advantage of an accident?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in general, I have not been excited about reading biographies. Any that I started, I stopped reading after a while. I still have not read a biography of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, for example, despite having intended to since my English teacher in high school showed us the film &lt;em&gt;Amadeus&lt;/em&gt; on the last day of school, and that accidentally set in motion a whole chain of events leading to my discovery of Mozart&amp;rsquo;s music and more. The same goes for Beethoven or Einstein or any number of other heroes of mine. I am more interested in what people have produced than in the minute details (real or hypothetical) of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;steve-jobs&#34;&gt;Steve Jobs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, when it comes to Steve Jobs, it is not even what he produced that is of most interest to me (although I have expressed my &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/05/i-cannot-imagine-my-life-without-the-influence-of-steve-jobs/&#34;&gt;indebtedness&lt;/a&gt; to the Apple II and Macintosh computers as a vehicle for my interest in computing as a user and as a programmer). In fact, some of what he has produced has always been of great concern to me: patent wars, a closed App Store ecosystem, a shaping of the computing world into a focus on consumption devices (such as iPods).  Richard Stallman (who happens to be another hero of mine, without whom I would not have entered computing either) tells of the dangers &lt;a href=&#34;http://stallman.org/archives/2011-jul-oct.html?ohai#27_October_2011_%28Steve_Jobs%29&#34;&gt;bluntly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What interests me most about Jobs is that he got stuff done. He worked hard, he had ideas, and he managed to get people to work together and implement his ideas. And he faced down failure and humiliation repeatedly, always bouncing back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, by chance, Jobs had mostly failed in his life, and not succeeded repeatedly, I am sure that there would not have been all the media coverage of his death, and all the tributes. He would have been just another loser. I get the impression that he has been praised because he succeeded, not because he tried. In fact, if he had failed, then probably all his negative traits and actions would have been the focus of attention. People would be blaming his authoritarian and often abusive management style for his failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Steve Jobs I admire most is not the one who succeeded. It is the one who tried, and did fail, and did not give up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Steve Jobs I love is the philosopher who lived his philosophy, the one with the memorable quotes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Steve Jobs I want to keep in my memory is the one who said, &amp;ldquo;Your time is limited, so don&amp;rsquo;t waste it living someone else&amp;rsquo;s life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So guess what? Instead of &lt;em&gt;wasting time&lt;/em&gt; reading his biography (as though living someone else&amp;rsquo;s life vicariously), in the weeks since his death I have been focused on following his advice and living &lt;em&gt;my life&lt;/em&gt;, getting refocused on &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; goals and projects. RIP, Steve Jobs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I Cannot Imagine My Life Without the Influence of Steve Jobs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs is gone, tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he&amp;rsquo;s not really gone. Everything he did is with us. With me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m typing this blog post on an early 2008 model MacBook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t like eulogies. But I have a few emotions right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Omitting mention of a couple of generations of other Macs I&amp;rsquo;ve owned: I became a programmer largely because his work showed that computers could be beautiful, useful, and liberating to ordinary human beings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs altered my direction in life. I wrote my first Kernighan and Ritchie &lt;code&gt;hello world\n&lt;/code&gt; C program on a Mac Classic. I learned C++ on a Mac SE/30. I got my first job writing my resume on the SE/30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before that, I wrote my first Pascal program using MacPascal on the original 128K Macintosh in school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before that, I wrote BASIC programs on an Apple IIe, my first computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skipping forward: at one point I bought an early PowerMac, but it was uninspiring: Apple had lost its way without Steve Jobs. I cursed Apple and abandoned it, bought a PC, and ran Linux for years. I never touched a Mac again until OS X came out. Steve Jobs was back!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs was a programmer, an artist, a businessman, a philosopher, a psychologist, a salesman, a speechwriter, a fighter. He cared about beauty, about consistency, stuck to his visions, failed and succeeded and failed and succeeded. I live because humanity produces men like Steve Jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is all. Tomorrow is another day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-2011-10-25&#34;&gt;Update (2011-10-25)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I write this short update to note that I never did get around to writing my intended in-depth discussion of Steve Jobs, but will do so at some point. For example, it was too close in time for me to launch into a personal exploration of the dark, negative sides of his legacy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
