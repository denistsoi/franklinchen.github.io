      <title>A comeback from Pittsburgh Marathon overtraining</title>

      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/04/06/comeback-from-pittsburgh-marathon-overtraining/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I reported on running Just A Short Run, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/03/30/report-on-just-a-short-run-my-first-half-marathon-in-nine-years/&#34;&gt;my first half marathon in nine years&lt;/a&gt;. One very real concern I had &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/03/03/my-first-steel-city-road-runners-winter-5k-race/&#34;&gt;when I put this race on my calendar a month ago&lt;/a&gt; was that recovery from it might interfere with my marathon training. Although I did not race Just A Short Run all out, I did put in a hard effort, and sure enough I did end up having a really tough training week afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the overtraining this week was partly my doing. Here I explain how I ended up feeling like I was falling apart, and how I recovered and felt pretty good during today&amp;rsquo;s long run.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/wow-run.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Pittsburgh Marathon Warmup on Walnut run&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;after-the-half-marathon&#34;&gt;After the half marathon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in my report, I had some issues after the race: my right lower calf/Achilles area seized up for a bit, and also my right second and third toes did as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, a day later, I was feeling very sore in my right lower calf and second toe. I should mention that I have &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morton%27s_toe&#34;&gt;Morton&amp;rsquo;s toe&lt;/a&gt; on both feet, although my left second toe is only barely longer than the big toe, while it is my right second toe that is noticeably longer than the big toe and therefore has a real tendency to cause me some problems:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/mortons-toe.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;My Morton&amp;#39;s toes&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So I did take a day off running after the half marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;monday-trying-to-be-careful&#34;&gt;Monday: trying to be careful&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even on Monday, I was still feeling sore. I decided that I should do some light running anyway, to avoid two days off completely from running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I very much wanted to finally start running in my new Luna Sandals, which I had received last week but put aside because of the half marathon. These are the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lunasandals.com/products/33-venado&#34;&gt;Venado with ATS laces and MGT footbed&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://s3.amazonaws.com/lunastore/images/255/full.jpg?1351720427&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Luna Sandals: Venado, ATS laces, MGT footbed&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I ended up running just an easy 2 miles on the treadmill in the morning in my Vibram FiveFingers Bikila LS shoes, and then after work, running 1.5 miles in the Luna Sandals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tuesday-new-shoes&#34;&gt;Tuesday: new shoes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, I was still not yet completely recovered either from the half marathon, but I felt I was ready to go for a normal run. I decided to do a real run in the Luna Sandals and did 5 miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encountered various problems while trying out the Luna Sandals, beginning to break them in. I got chafed in various places from the straps and buckle:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/luna-sandals-2013-04-02/feet.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Feet chafed&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/luna-sandals-2013-04-02/side.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Side view&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/luna-sandals-2013-04-02/wearing.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Feet in&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/luna-sandals-2013-04-02/heel.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;View of heel&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And it was tricky keeping the sandals on at all. I fidgeted a lot with the laces to try to keep my heels from slipping. I kept on having problems with my right heel slipping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, although my calf was healing up, I was more worried about my right second toe, which seemed sore and sensitive. I noticed that my tendency to impact the second toe (after all, it is my longest toe) was causing trouble. I had not really encountered any problems until after the half marathon, but the intensity of that effort, and the fact that my Bikila LS shoes were getting worn down at the toes, must have exposed this biomechanical weakness finally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;wednesday-overexcited&#34;&gt;Wednesday: overexcited&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday, I was excited about running, and used the Luna Sandals again. I still had slippage and chafing issues, but figured that there was a break-in process. The soles were starting to shape to my feet, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I accidentally (because of taking impromptu routes in Homewood Cemetery) ran 9 miles when I had originally intended to run more like 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second toe was startling to tingle and really complain: even normal walking triggered pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;thursday-admission-of-overtraining&#34;&gt;Thursday: admission of overtraining&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday was one of those days when I truly &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/01/14/three-questions-to-ask-yourself-when-you-dont-feel-like-doing-your-scheduled-workout/&#34;&gt;had to ask myself three questions&lt;/a&gt;. I was simply feeling &lt;em&gt;exhausted&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I forced myself to completely take Thursday off from running (or strength training, for that matter), while evaluating my situation. This was no longer just about my toe, but about my overall fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I had to fix this toe problem somehow, and soon, because I had a long run planned for Saturday. So I observed myself closely while walking. I noticed that I had a tendency to do a weird retracting motion on the toe when walking, a motion I do not use on my left foot. I questioned the purpose of this reflex. I found that I could &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; not to perform the retracting motion. It was difficult to make this choice, but if I really focused, I could control how I &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; my foot. I remembered lessons from &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_technique&#34;&gt;Alexander technique&lt;/a&gt; about observing and unlearning habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I discovered the reason my right hip has sometimes felt sore: my right hip has sagged in my posture. I also found that correcting this shifted the balance of weight on my right foot, and alleviated the pressure on my second toe, shifting more weight where it should be, more toward the big toe under the ball of the foot. These were very interesting discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, I felt so tired that I decided to go ahead and cancel my Sunday plan to play in the final round of the Pittsburgh Chess League season; I had really wanted to put in one final appearance for our team, after not having actually played for us since &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/11/11/pittsburgh-chess-league-round-3-back-to-chess-after-a-month-off/&#34;&gt;last November&lt;/a&gt;, because something kept on coming up every month since then, but I had little confidence that I would be mentally alert on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;friday-still-playing-it-safe&#34;&gt;Friday: still playing it safe&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday, I was feeling energetic enough to run, but I forced myself to take another day off for the sake of my right toe. It was not easy, but I reminded myself that &lt;em&gt;not being able to do my long run&lt;/em&gt; was not worth one more missed day of training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of running, I did one rep of the Cathedral of Learning stair climb, just to get some activity in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;saturday-my-14-mile-long-run&#34;&gt;Saturday: my 14-mile long run&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, I felt my right toe had recovered sufficiently that I was going to be OK doing my planned long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Steel City Road Runners had a 10-mile run lined up starting in Shadyside after a program of dynamics warmups by Dr. Vonda Wright, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pittsburghmarathon.com/wow.asp&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Warmup on Walnut&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, outside of sponsor &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.truerunner.com/&#34;&gt;True Runner&lt;/a&gt;. My plan was to skip that program, but create a 14-mile run by running 2 miles from home to the Shadyside point and then joining the group run and then running 2 miles back home afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the 10-mile loop:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe id=&#34;mapmyfitness_route&#34; src=&#34;http://snippets.mapmycdn.com/routes/view/embedded/187175578?width=560&amp;height=400&amp;elevation=true&amp;info=true&amp;line_color=E60f0bdb&amp;rgbhex=DB0B0E&amp;distance_markers=1&amp;unit_type=imperial&amp;map_mode=TERRAIN&amp;last_updated=2013-04-01T09:44:11-04:00&#34; height=&#34;590px&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: right; padding-right: 20px;&#34;&gt;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;http://mapmyrun.com/routes/create/&#34;&gt;Create Maps&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;http://mapmyrun.com/routes/&#34;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; from 80 million at &lt;a href=&#34;http://mapmyrun.com&#34;&gt;MapMyRun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-goal&#34;&gt;My goal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal for this long run was to make it a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mcmillanrunning.com/index.php/articlePages/article/2&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;fast finish long run&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. In particular, in planning my run, I had noted that the last 5 miles of the course involved a steady uphill as well as a steeper uphill through Oakland on Forbes Avenue. In the 2003 Pittsburgh Marathon ten years ago, this uphill had proved a bit discouraging to me (because I had, frankly, gone out too fast). In any case, for psychological and physiological reasons, I wanted to do this whole uphill fast and strong in this particular workout. In the actual marathon in a month, of course, I don&amp;rsquo;t plan to run it as fast, but I did want to remember the landmarks and mental state of doing something difficult but in a relaxed way. I wanted to focus on applying my newly discovered knowledge about my posture and stride asymmetry and &amp;ldquo;run tall&amp;rdquo; up the hill, with balanced hips, while monitoring my right second toe to make sure it did not get battered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was still not comfortable with the Luna Sandals, so I fell back to the shoes I&amp;rsquo;ve been wearing for almost all of my runs in the past three months, the Bikila LS shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;showed-up-late&#34;&gt;Showed up late&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I strangely miscalculated my departure from home to run 2 miles to Aiken Avenue and Walnut Street, and showed up 4 minutes late, just as runners were already heading off. I grabbed a printed map and picked up the pace so that I could try to catch up to the 10:00 pace group. I did, realizing of course that I was making my task in the final miles of my run more difficult as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conquering-the-oakland-hill&#34;&gt;Conquering the Oakland hill&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed the Oakland hill pretty well, being very focused. I continued going hard all the way back to True Runner in Shadyside. Near the end, I felt my calves getting tight, just as in the half marathon last week when my right calf seized up after I was walking after the finish line. I thought it was very useful to have triggered this exact sensation and knowing where it was, because it meant that maybe I would be able to train my body to accept that state of fatigue (after running 12 miles) and continue. Also, the feeling cleared up fairly quickly after I stopped to walk, so I think last week the real trigger was my pointless little sprint near the end. If I avoid any sprinting during the marathon, I might well be able to avoid cramping. At least, that is the plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-decision-about-gatorade&#34;&gt;A decision about Gatorade&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I drank some more Gatorade back at Walnut Street, then ran home. I was really quite tired by this point and my stomach wasn&amp;rsquo;t feeling so great. I ate some actual food and eventually recovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this run, no gels were provided, so I drank Gatorade as my only fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my final conclusion, solidifying a thought I had last week in the half marathon: &lt;em&gt;Gatorade is bad for me&lt;/em&gt;, and I should &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; avoid it in future runs and in the Pittsburgh Marathon! It was good to learn this for sure now. In fact, it is quite possible that some of the issues I had in the 2003 Pittsburgh Marathon were a result of Gatorade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GU gel works OK for me, but according to the official &lt;a href=&#34;http://pittsburghmarathon.com/Course.asp&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Marathon fluid station table&lt;/a&gt;, GU is provided only starting at mile 9.7. Therefore, I am going to pack some gels to ingest during the first 10 miles of the marathon! I will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; drink any Gatorade!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some ill-advised overtraining and injury this week after my half marathon, I forced myself to take two days off to recover, and used the time to diagnose possible causes of my biomechanical problems. I found some good hypotheses and possible solutions, and managed a high quality &amp;ldquo;fast finish long run&amp;rdquo; and am optimistic about my continuing training for the Pittsburgh Marathon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Injuries from yoga are common: some tips on staying safe</title>

      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/01/06/injuries-from-yoga-are-common-some-tips-on-staying-safe/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For years now, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that when people find out that I do yoga, they often say something like
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I tried yoga once and I got hurt. I thought it was supposed to be relaxing.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I read an article, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/08/magazine/how-yoga-can-wreck-your-body.html?pagewanted=all&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;How Yoga Can Wreck Your Body&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. I urge anyone who currently does yoga, or is thinking about starting it, to read this article. It discusses cases of quite serious injury in yoga practitioners, including instructors, and reveals a world of danger that many may not be aware of, given how popular and hip yoga has become in the past decade or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not a yoga instructor, and I&amp;rsquo;m also not a fanatic yoga devotee, but since I once did yoga every other day for a couple of years, and found it extremely, astoundingly beneficial, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share some ideas on how I have managed to avoid being injured by yoga. I&amp;rsquo;ll also discuss related issues with Pilates and sitting meditation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-discovery-of-yoga&#34;&gt;My discovery of yoga&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first exposure to yoga at all was an infamous episode of the TV show &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That&#39;s_Incredible!&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s Incredible!&lt;/a&gt; in which some guy named &amp;ldquo;Yogi Kudu&amp;rdquo; folded himself up into a box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point, yoga became mainstream and offered as a &amp;ldquo;fitness&amp;rdquo; class. I got the impression that women and dancers took it up, and I had no interest in yoga until I got into ballroom dance in 2000, became very serious about it, and got my first exposure, from competition-oriented ballroom dancers, to such favorite dancer-oriented activities as yoga, Pilates, and Alexander technique. But any time I did even a basic yoga pose, I found myself embarrassingly inflexible and the whole idea seemed boring to me anyway, so I did not seriously pursue yoga for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as I had also begun to run, and then continued to be very serious about it, I heard from various sources that yoga could be beneficial to runners also. It was not until 2002, when I started training for my first marathon, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pittsburghmarathon.com/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Marathon&lt;/a&gt;, that I felt that maybe I should check out yoga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to some free sampler classes, but found them unsatisfactory. Ironically, I probably prevented early injury as a result. Here&amp;rsquo;s why: I &lt;strong&gt;think about what pain and discomfort mean&lt;/strong&gt;! I felt physically and mentally uncomfortable and did not continue going to group classes, but decided on some self-study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-drawbacks-of-group-classes&#34;&gt;The drawbacks of group classes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a standard group class, there are many drawbacks to learning &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; subject. Yoga is no exception. Without individual instruction and detailed feedback, it is easy to do all kinds of horrible things to your body. Some people are &amp;ldquo;wimps&amp;rdquo;, and they are actually the smart ones, because they quit thinking (incorrectly, I would add), &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not cut out for yoga.&amp;rdquo; Others push through the pain thinking, &amp;ldquo;no pain, no gain&amp;rdquo;. Having incorrectly adopted this attitude earlier, when overdoing my running, I knew from experience that I never wanted again to go too far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worse, it&amp;rsquo;s discouraging when you can&amp;rsquo;t keep up some standard sequence the instructor leads everyone as a group through, while some people around you are doing just fine. Yes, we should check our &lt;em&gt;ego&lt;/em&gt; at the door, but sometimes that is hard, and trying to learn something difficult while ego interferes is not optimal. A good instructor will give detailed instructions on modifying poses or movements, or substituting them entirely with rest that does not break the flow, but given the sampler classes I have experienced, I can safely say that not every instructor pays this much attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the subtleties of each pose and its intention are hardly explained, in a typical drop-in yoga class. If yoga classes were structured within real progressing sequences with prerequisites, rather than existing as free-floating interchangeable drop-in commodities, maybe there would be better explanations. The typical yoga class I have gone to has instructors trying to scope out or ask aloud, &amp;ldquo;Who here is new?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-i-started-a-regular-private-practice-of-yoga&#34;&gt;How I started a regular private practice of yoga&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As my curiosity was whetted from the sampler classes, I decided to try out some books and videos on yoga. I am a big fan of self-learning, through books, videos, and the vast resource that is the entire Web. I can learn more detail about technique, I can read about comparisons, I can go at my own pace, and in privacy (eliminating the fear of embarrassment). I can choose which subsets to explore and use, rather than be subjected to someone else&amp;rsquo;s rigid ideas or instruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quickly found that the books and videos of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Yee&#34;&gt;Rodney Yee&lt;/a&gt; worked very well for me. For a couple of years, I ended up using a several of his &amp;ldquo;Power Yoga&amp;rdquo; DVDs as my primary half-hour-or-so yoga sessions every other day. I would definitely recommend them. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I like about Yee&amp;rsquo;s videos:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a male, I happen to enjoy having a male instructor and role model to emulate; although I have used videos by female instructors also, I find it jarring to follow a female instructor who is far more flexible in various ways than a typical male instructor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yee has a soothing, encouraging voice and delivery of instructions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yee&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;pace&lt;/em&gt; is usually pretty good for me, not too fast, not too slow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Relatively few poses&lt;/em&gt; are used in most of his videos I have used. It is better to try to master a few important &lt;em&gt;simpler&lt;/em&gt; poses than to squander attention on a whole lot of poses. Also, I will claim that the more complex the pose, the greater the potential for injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are different workouts with different intensities: &amp;ldquo;stamina&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;strength&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;flexibility&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;benefits-i-have-experienced-from-yoga&#34;&gt;Benefits I have experienced from yoga&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of yoga, every single year in the past decade, I have become more flexible. &lt;strong&gt;I am now more flexible than I was in high school.&lt;/strong&gt; That&amp;rsquo;s really something, and it&amp;rsquo;s great being more flexible. When your body is looser, it is less stressed and burdened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have improved my posture. Stretching out the spine through persistent practice of yoga really works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increased awareness of breath is something I learned both from running and from yoga. A good yoga instructor reminds you to pay attention to inhaling and exhaling in harmony with your movements. The circulation helps clear up one&amp;rsquo;s mind and both awaken and relax the body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balance. Many of the poses challenge one&amp;rsquo;s balance. I have spent much of my life slumping in chairs and other furniture. Yoga helped reverse the bad habits and imbalance coming from a sedentary lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-yoga-poses-i-am-currently-careful-about-or-avoid&#34;&gt;Some yoga poses I am currently careful about or avoid&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t do all the poses Yee demonstrates, and the ones I do, I don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily do in the full extension given. Here are some issues I discovered apply to myself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reclined leg stretch. Personally, I have tight hamstrings I&amp;rsquo;m still working on. I can&amp;rsquo;t do a full leg stretch. As recommended, I use a strap. I make sure not to compromise my &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; when doing stuff like this. I have seen a lot of people straining.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various deep back bends. I simply do not trust these. I have had back injuries in the past, and although I am fine now, I don&amp;rsquo;t ever want to injure my back again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Downward-facing dog. I make sure to use the modified bent-knee variation if I feel too tight in my hamstrings or Achilles tendons or elsewhere. I have seen people with legs straight but &lt;em&gt;backs&lt;/em&gt; curved: this is not good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various forward bends. Again, I protect my &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt;, by bending my knees if I feel the need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lunge. This is easy for me now, but at the very beginning, I had trouble doing this. A &lt;em&gt;block&lt;/em&gt; is a great prop for modification of poses by decreasing the distance to the ground. I used blocks extensively when first getting into yoga, and I still use them today as I feel the need. There are no bonus points for going without a block out of ego.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Triangle pose. I like this pose, but don&amp;rsquo;t ever expect to perform it without modification. To put the palm of my hand on the ground just twists and hurts my &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;hip&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anything that puts pressure on my &lt;em&gt;neck&lt;/em&gt;, I avoid or modify. Why do I really need to pull my head back far for cobra, or for upward-facing dog? It doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More elaborate poses involving lifting off the ground can put pressure on the &lt;em&gt;neck&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;wrists&lt;/em&gt;. I avoid them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;current-group-class&#34;&gt;Current group class&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby and I sometimes attend a local free &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/09/24/roaring-like-a-lion-on-a-saturday/&#34;&gt;drop-in class at the Squirrel Hill Library&lt;/a&gt;. We don&amp;rsquo;t go often, but it is nice in small doses. Some of the reasons we don&amp;rsquo;t go often:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The session is very long, and we prefer shorter sessions. Some people do leave early, but breaking the flow of a complete workout (that includes a nice relaxation segment at the end) just seems inappropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t get detailed technical instruction on how to do things right. This is a very large group class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are encouraged or guided to go into difficult poses that we are not comfortable with. Yes, the instructor does tell us we don&amp;rsquo;t have to do them, and yes, we know to listen to our bodies, but still, it is somewhat disorienting to decide not to do something when other people are doing it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the important thing when doing yoga is &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/11/04/against-just-putting-in-the-time/&#34;&gt;not to do it mechanically, but with awareness and no ego&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-current-practice&#34;&gt;My current practice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually have not done full yoga sessions in two or three years. I do go into some yoga poses spontaneously as part of a stretch and then cool down for other activities, including running, dancing, and strength training. For this new year of 2012, I intend to get back into extended yoga practice. I will continue to write about deepening my yoga experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;pilates&#34;&gt;Pilates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to confess that I do not like Pilates. Many of the positions involved in Pilates cause me great stress. I have given Pilates a serious try. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s just me, or if other people have a similar experience, but lifting my head up from the ground, for example, causes me great stress. It definitely increases my blood pressure and gives me a headache and strain on my neck and back. This is just my personal experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pilates confuses me. I avoid it. I like to try many different physical disciplines, but Pilates is one that I have abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sitting-meditation&#34;&gt;Sitting meditation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sitting meditation in a classic lotus position is incredibly difficult. Let me put it this way: after a few years of some periods of regular sitting, it is only in the past two or three months that I am able to sit in something resembling a full lotus position. And I don&amp;rsquo;t like to do this continuously for more than around twenty minutes. That&amp;rsquo;s my limitation. People have wrecked their knees or ankles doing meditation, so as with yoga, it&amp;rsquo;s extremely important not to force yourself into a position that you can&amp;rsquo;t handle. And take note of your motivations. Don&amp;rsquo;t reward yourself with bonus points for doing an &amp;ldquo;advanced&amp;rdquo; position. That&amp;rsquo;s not the point of meditation. I try for lotus purely because it really is more stable than some other more asymmetrical positions, such as Burmese and half Burmese. And I have tried kneeling with or without a bench, but that causes me various problems, for my knees and ankles. And sitting on a chair is definitely suboptimal for the meditation experience, because of the lack of a truly stable base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in simpler positions, I can get numb or feel pressure on my ligaments or something. There is always controversy, among different meditation leaders, over how much discomfort to tolerate as an essential part of the practice, and how much is harmful and justifies shifting position or changing position entirely, but I am happy that in the group practice I attend, we are allowed to err on the side of looking out for ourselves. If you meditate in a group, be sure to understand what your leader&amp;rsquo;s expectations are, and make sure they are in line with what you are prepared to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoga can be very dangerous if you don&amp;rsquo;t have experience paying attention to your body and being really in touch with what is painful and harmful and what is merely challenging and beneficial. I advise that beginners progress very slowly when taking up yoga, ideally with feedback from an instructor who is aware of the dangers. I advise that experienced practitioners do a full review of what they do and what might be causing undue discomfort or pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caveats aside, I have found yoga to be a transformative part of my life, refreshing and rejuvenating, and recommend it as a practice to those wishing to deepen their understanding and experience of their mind, body, spirit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
