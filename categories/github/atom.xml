      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight the &lt;a href=&#34;http://java.net/projects/pittjug/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Java User Group&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/pittjug/&#34;&gt;PittJUG&lt;/a&gt;) had another meeting at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pghtech.org/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Technology Council&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/matthewmccull&#34;&gt;Matthew McCullough&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; gave a talk &amp;ldquo;Get Going with &lt;a href=&#34;http://git-scm.com/&#34;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; on Java Projects&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived early and couldn&amp;rsquo;t help admiring the view outside before entering the building as there was still daylight. Here are the Birmingham Bridge and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monongahela_River&#34;&gt;Monongahela River&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a good time tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;social-time&#34;&gt;Social time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PittJUG meetings are advertised as starting at 5:30 PM, although the talk starts at 6:00. These days I always try to get there by 5:30 in order to get a good seat, settle in, and eat pizza and socialize, and that&amp;rsquo;s what I did today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-talk&#34;&gt;The talk&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/pittjug-2012-02-21/matthew-mccullough-git.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Matthew McCullough of GitHub speaking on Git at PittJUG&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Matthew McCullough gave an energetic and clear presentation on some fundamentals of Git. There were good questions from the audience throughout, and he answered them well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title of the talk was, I suppose, inaccurate, because there was not much that was Java-specific. It was more of a general introduction to Git. He is going to be doing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pghtech.org/networks/PittJug/events.aspx&#34;&gt;GitHub&amp;rsquo;s Git Foundations Workshop tomorrow&lt;/a&gt;, covering much more of Git and details of Java environments. I am not attending this workshop, but based on his introductory presentation today, I&amp;rsquo;m sure it will be great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how to summarize his talk, since I came to it already having spent quite a bit of time learning and understanding Git from various sources, including working through many &lt;a href=&#34;http://gitimmersion.com/&#34;&gt;tutorials&lt;/a&gt;, reading excellent &lt;a href=&#34;http://progit.org/&#34;&gt;Web references&lt;/a&gt; and other books, and actually using it on a daily basis for some time now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-learning-style&#34;&gt;My learning style&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am definitely not yet an &amp;ldquo;expert&amp;rdquo; at Git (I have done some interactive rebasing, but nothing more complicated than that), so I felt it would be very useful to get an integrated personal view of what is important about Git and why, and Matthew was great at telling a story with his own words and emphases and personal anecdotes, such as moving &lt;a href=&#34;http://groovy.codehaus.org/&#34;&gt;Groovy&lt;/a&gt; over from &lt;a href=&#34;http://subversion.apache.org/&#34;&gt;Subversion&lt;/a&gt; to Git. I did end up taking quite a few notes even though I already &amp;ldquo;knew&amp;rdquo; most of what he talked about, because I liked various tips or analogies that he made. I find it highly valuable to get different narratives whenever deepening my understanding of something; in school and outside of school, I have always read multiple books in parallel, finding myself some book other than the &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; one, in order to broaden my perspective and as a robustness/redundancy measure, in case (as always happens), one source is flawed or confusing in some section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed this PittJUG meeting and am motivated to continue to improve my understanding and use of Git. Actually, at work I am about to transition a legacy Subversion repository to Git. I expect we will get a lot of benefits from this transition, and I will report on the results after I effect the transition and observe how everyone operates under the new system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
