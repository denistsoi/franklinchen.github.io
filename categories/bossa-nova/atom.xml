      <description>&lt;p&gt;I encountered an intriguing article &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.npr.org/2014/02/10/274687110/brazils-maria-rita-rediscovers-her-mother-through-music&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Brazil&amp;rsquo;s Maria Rita Rediscovers Her Mother Through Music&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;maria-rita&#34;&gt;Maria Rita&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The name &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Rita&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Maria Rita&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; was familiar to me for only one reason: exactly one year ago, by coincidence, right after &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/02/10/attending-j-jam-in-squirrel-hill-but-not-playing-music-in-it/&#34;&gt;attending a music performance&lt;/a&gt;, I was looking up performances of the bolero &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pbs.org/buenavista/music/songs/dos_gardenias.html&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dos Gardenias&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube, in order to see what was out there, and also to find a &amp;ldquo;karaoke&amp;rdquo; version I could use to practice singing to and playing the flute to (I ended up &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/03/17/finally-doing-some-latin-music-jamming-on-flute/&#34;&gt;playing the piece on flute a month later at a party&lt;/a&gt;), and one of the performances that struck me as notable and unusual was hers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that in this NPR program, when asked to choose a musical selection to end the program with, Maria Rita chose her recording of &amp;ldquo;Dos Gardenias&amp;rdquo;. You can watch a video of a live performance of hers &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DoBORm4iyE&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (sorry, the provider did not allow it to be embeddable). Do watch it: I found it strangely mesmerizing. It is understated compared to &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; bolero style, yet expressive in its own way. Also, this video has her moving to the music while singing, eyes closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it turns out that Maria Rita&amp;rsquo;s mother was the famous Brazilian singer &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elis_Regina&#34;&gt;Elis Regina&lt;/a&gt;, who died at 36. The interview was interesting because it brought up the issue of what it&amp;rsquo;s like being the child of a famous musician, because if you&amp;rsquo;re a musician also, then there are always comparisons and questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what I want to return to my real topic, which is the bolero &amp;ldquo;Dos Gardenias&amp;rdquo;, one of my favorite boleros ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;love-on-first-listen-ibrahim-ferrer-1999&#34;&gt;Love on first listen: Ibrahim Ferrer, 1999&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first encountered &amp;ldquo;Dos Gardenias&amp;rdquo; through Ibrahim Ferrer&amp;rsquo;s performance in &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buena_Vista_Social_Club_%28album%29&#34;&gt;Buena Vista Social Club&lt;/a&gt;, the film and the CD, which I came across in 2000, shortly after it came out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still love this live performance by Ibrahim Ferrer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/mz_01le5pMs&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here he is from the CD:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/5pKW7qvYSHU&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-i-love-this-song&#34;&gt;Why I love this song&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://lyricstranslate.com/en/dos-gardenias-two-gardenias.html&#34;&gt;lyrics&lt;/a&gt; are singable and comprehensible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The harmonic structure is distinctive, because it uses both the natural minor and the altered harmonic minor (raised 7th). This gives the song both an exotic and unstable feeling, corresponding to the emotional content of the lyrics. Check out when the 7th is raised and when it is not. In addition, the 4th is augmented. All this chromaticism drives well the song&amp;rsquo;s emotional content, implying various different modal regions coinciding with changes in the narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The melody has a good dramatic range, and has varying intervals in motion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;antonio-machin-1947&#34;&gt;Antonio Machin, 1947&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m always interested in alternate performances of songs, both new and old. So I went back to the source, the great &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Mach%C3%ADn&#34;&gt;Antonio Machin&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/OPq2ye7hJQg&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is faster than Ferrer&amp;rsquo;s rendition. If you examine the history of bolero performance in general, you will find that things have gotten slower and more sentimental over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find that there are pluses and minuses to different styles and speeds. I rather like the clarity and drama of the older faster tempo and style, but also like the room for more emotional expressiveness and freedom when slower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;omara-portuondo-2010&#34;&gt;Omara Portuondo, 2010&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that Abby and I went to a &lt;a href=&#34;http://trustarts.culturaldistrict.org/production/25334&#34;&gt;concert by Omara Portuondo here in Pittsburgh on November 7, 2010&lt;/a&gt;, in which she performed &amp;ldquo;Dos Gardenias&amp;rdquo;. And someone captured that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/9QjS2MnAfR0&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an interesting, very free rendition, without the usual full rhythmic backup, but instead featuring some subtle guitar accompaniment. It was different, but I did not like it so much. I think the regular structure of the song, the way the lyrics fit into the movement, makes it work better when the original motoric bolero rhythm is maintained, with the harmonic motion driving the narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;lucrecia-1996&#34;&gt;Lucrecia, 1996&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a random other performance I found. I didn&amp;rsquo;t like it at all. The phrasing seems all weird and distorted, and the song&amp;rsquo;s been reharmonized strangely also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/zgoEHFgwGes&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sertab-erener-2007&#34;&gt;Sertab Erener, 2007&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked the performance of this Turkish pop singer Sertab Erener. She includes some distinctive middle Eastern styling that are unusual for this Cuban music, but her musicality cannot be denied. (Unfortunately, the &amp;ldquo;dance&amp;rdquo; sequences in this video are not at all bolero. Ignore the video.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/d-0SKj7AjZg&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can I say, I&amp;rsquo;m obsessed with this beautiful bolero. However you like this song interpreted, it&amp;rsquo;s a must-listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t sung it outside my home yet, but I guess I should get around to it, maybe at a party in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;postscript-on-elis-regina&#34;&gt;Postscript on Elis Regina&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out Maria Rita&amp;rsquo;s mother, Elis Regina, singing the famous bossa nova song &amp;ldquo;Triste&amp;rdquo; in 1976:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/5wiJPgmEqR0&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been obsessed for some time with Piazzolla&amp;rsquo;s beautiful tango piece &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.astor-piazzolla.org/astor-piazzolla-oblivion/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oblivion&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. I was planning to perform it some time on flute, but today, by accident, I decided that I want to play it on my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.grothmusic.com/p-4654-hohner-s32-student-32-key-melodica.aspx&#34;&gt;melodica&lt;/a&gt; instead!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/hohner-student-32-melodica.jpg&#34; /&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Hohner Student 32 Melodica&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-melodica-came-into-the-picture&#34;&gt;How melodica came into the picture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This afternoon was the first rehearsal of the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/11/24/preparing-to-play-irish-flute-in-the-holiday-ball/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Holiday Ball Orchestra&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. (Today was also round 4 of the Pittsburgh Chess League team matches, but as I did once before for round 1, I &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/09/16/excited-by-the-new-season-of-the-pittsburgh-recorder-society/&#34;&gt;prioritized music over chess&lt;/a&gt; and told the team I could not play.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the rehearsal, I played both flute and Irish flute, depending on the key. Afterward, while socializing, I happened to ask about the ukuleles that some people had. I mentioned that I still hadn&amp;rsquo;t gotten around to learning ukulele, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/12/11/learning-another-instrument-the-tin-whistle/&#34;&gt;despite having intended to&lt;/a&gt; and bought a soprano a long while back. I just found it very hard to get started with my first string instrument, and other things came up. I joked about the other instruments I have that I don&amp;rsquo;t play, including my &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/01/run-shadyside-5k-outrunning-mickey-mouse-and-lending-a-trumpet/&#34;&gt;melodica&lt;/a&gt;. Lynette said in all seriousness that I was welcome to play it at the Holiday Ball.
So after I got home, I pulled out the melodica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-melodica-good-for&#34;&gt;What is the melodica good for?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that I don&amp;rsquo;t think the melodica works well at all for the Holiday Ball music, actually. The instrument is not best at fast runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But&lt;/strong&gt;, since I had the instrument out: I decided to try playing it &lt;em&gt;in place of flute&lt;/em&gt; for some music I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on, such as tango and bossa nova. And I discovered that &lt;em&gt;melodica works great&lt;/em&gt; for these kinds of music! Then one thing led to another, and I was searching for covers of various songs on melodica on YouTube, and found quite a lot of cool performances by people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I&amp;rsquo;m completely serious about preparing to use my melodica in actual musical performances. Frankly, a lot of music I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing on flute sounds better with a darker, reeded instrument such as the melodica. For example, I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing jazzy bossa nova that I think really works best with a saxophone, but I don&amp;rsquo;t (yet!) play saxophone. The melodica works well as a substitute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In tango, of course, a bandoneón is the traditional instrument, and accordions are commonly used instead. Here, again, the melodica is great, for the melody line anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, other music that involves accordions or harmonicas work great with melodica as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;piazzolla-s-oblivion&#34;&gt;Piazzolla&amp;rsquo;s Oblivion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I am confessedly obsessed with &amp;ldquo;Oblivion&amp;rdquo;, here are some performances I found moving or otherwise useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;flute-guitar&#34;&gt;Flute/guitar&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s Cavatina Duo on flute and guitar:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/sZD7aGqmO6w&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;melodica-with-chamber-group&#34;&gt;Melodica with chamber group&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is someone playing melodica:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/fG0TcCFUrBQ&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;melodica-and-piano-discovered-2013-08-22&#34;&gt;Melodica and piano (discovered 2013-08-22)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Japanese duo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/AAP4GB8T8DI&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;accordion&#34;&gt;Accordion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my friend Henry playing his solo arrangement for accordion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/FrOHDEMOhkc&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;bandoneón-and-piano&#34;&gt;Bandoneón and piano&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julian Rowlands and Ivo de Greef:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/sj-JUBIGKnE&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;violin-and-orchestra&#34;&gt;Violin and orchestra&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vesko Eschkenazy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/kP6Vgm4k4xc&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;voice&#34;&gt;Voice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow. Wow. Milva singing French lyrics, Piazzolla himself on bandoneón!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/lzC1kKZGxBg&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;recorder-quartet-discovered-2013-08-22&#34;&gt;Recorder quartet (discovered 2013-08-22)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Japanese recorder quartet, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.geocities.jp/sekishirecorderquartet/english.htm&#34;&gt;Sekishi Recorder Quartet&lt;/a&gt;. Very nice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/3PmaOyZNWo8&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tango-dancers&#34;&gt;Tango dancers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, here are Daniela Pucci and Luis Bianchi dancing to the piece:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/RdU3eORpNhY&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, here is Daniela Pucci explaining why she gave up her MIT academic faculty career for tango:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/7BbAt1gnkBE&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a tango fan, make sure to read Daniel Pucci&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thedelicatestrength.com/?p=1522&#34;&gt;great article on tango dance connection&lt;/a&gt;. It is consonant with my own dance philosophy as well as music philosophy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By accident, I have rediscovered the melodica, and now intend to work on it as a serious melodic instrument!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-of-2014-10-23&#34;&gt;(Update of 2014-10-23)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/09/13/finally-playing-piazzollas-oblivion-on-flute/&#34;&gt;I put up more videos&lt;/a&gt; I found of &amp;ldquo;Oblivion&amp;rdquo; while thinking back to 2013 when I did play it on flute after all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-melodica-came-into-the-picture&#34;&gt;How melodica came into the picture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This afternoon was the first rehearsal of the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/11/24/preparing-to-play-irish-flute-in-the-holiday-ball/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Holiday Ball Orchestra&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;In tango, of course, a bandoneón is the traditional instrument, and accordions are commonly used instead. Here, again, the melodica is great, for the melody line anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, other music that involves accordions or harmonicas work great with melodica as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;piazzolla-s-oblivion&#34;&gt;Piazzolla&amp;rsquo;s Oblivion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I am confessedly obsessed with &amp;ldquo;Oblivion&amp;rdquo;, here are some performances I found moving or otherwise useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;flute-guitar&#34;&gt;Flute/guitar&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s Cavatina Duo on flute and guitar:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;melodica-with-chamber-group&#34;&gt;Melodica with chamber group&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is someone playing melodica:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/fG0TcCFUrBQ&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Japanese duo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;accordion&#34;&gt;Accordion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my friend Henry playing his solo arrangement for accordion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;bandoneón-and-piano&#34;&gt;Bandoneón and piano&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julian Rowlands and Ivo de Greef:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/sj-JUBIGKnE&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;violin-and-orchestra&#34;&gt;Violin and orchestra&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vesko Eschkenazy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;voice&#34;&gt;Voice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow. Wow. Milva singing French lyrics, Piazzolla himself on bandoneón!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/lzC1kKZGxBg&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Japanese recorder quartet, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.geocities.jp/sekishirecorderquartet/english.htm&#34;&gt;Sekishi Recorder Quartet&lt;/a&gt;. Very nice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tango-dancers&#34;&gt;Tango dancers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, here are Daniela Pucci and Luis Bianchi dancing to the piece:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, here is Daniela Pucci explaining why she gave up her MIT academic faculty career for tango:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/7BbAt1gnkBE&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a tango fan, make sure to read Daniel Pucci&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thedelicatestrength.com/?p=1522&#34;&gt;great article on tango dance connection&lt;/a&gt;. It is consonant with my own dance philosophy as well as music philosophy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By accident, I have rediscovered the melodica, and now intend to work on it as a serious melodic instrument!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Yesterday evening, I ended up unexpectedly &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/10/27/singing-an-irish-ballad-as-an-asian-pirate-at-a-halloween-belly-dance-hafla/&#34;&gt;singing alone in public for the first time in my life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This evening, I ended up unexpectedly singing again, with guitarist &lt;a href=&#34;http://cantorben.com/&#34;&gt;Cantor Ben Rosner&lt;/a&gt; accompanying me: the first time in my life singing with an accompanist for the general public, and the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with a guitarist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had just met for the first time this evening, and had only a minute ahead of time to agree on a suitable tempo and have him quickly sight read chords before we just launched into the music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had not come to the local Dunkin&amp;rsquo; Donuts in Squirrel Hill expecting to &lt;em&gt;sing&lt;/em&gt; at all, actually! What happened?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-story-behind-the-jam-session-at-dunkin-donuts&#34;&gt;The story behind the jam session at Dunkin&amp;rsquo; Donuts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby had recently just met a new guy playing in the [Pittsburgh Mandolin Orchestra], &lt;a href=&#34;http://cantorben.wix.com/cantor-benjamin-rosner&#34;&gt;Cantor Ben Rosner&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bethshalompgh.org/&#34;&gt;Congregation Beth Shalom&lt;/a&gt; in Squirrel Hill. He was passing out flyers advertising a music jam session he was organizing, &amp;ldquo;J-Jam&amp;rdquo;, to be held tonight in the local Dunkin&amp;rsquo; Donuts, which happens to be &lt;a href=&#34;http://triblive.com/home/1926901-74/hill-squirrel-dunkin-donuts-kosher-pittsburgh-says-area-jewish-restaurant&#34;&gt;the only Dunkin&amp;rsquo; Donuts in the area that is certified kosher&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently this was not the first &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thejewishchronicle.net/view/full_story/19127215/article-Open-mic-night-draws-Jewish-performers-to-Dunkin%E2%80%99-Donuts?instance=news_special_coverage_right_column&#34;&gt;Jewish community oriented music jam held at Dunkin&amp;rsquo; Donuts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-of-2013-01-16&#34;&gt;(Update of 2013-01-16)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J-Jam now has its own &lt;a href=&#34;http://jjampgh.webs.com/&#34;&gt;official Web site&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/jjamPGH&#34;&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;. Check them out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;deciding-to-participate&#34;&gt;Deciding to participate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I hear about music jams, I get excited as well as nervous. I always feel that I wish I were a much better musician than I am now, so that I don&amp;rsquo;t always feel that I&amp;rsquo;m the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; one at these events, but at the same time, I learn so much from just being out there, both to enjoy hearing other musicians, and to study how they do what they do, and in turn try to provide something of my own soul to other musicians and the audience as well. It&amp;rsquo;s like being naked; it&amp;rsquo;s still really tough for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I was intrigued because, well, Dunkin&amp;rsquo; Donuts should be pretty low key, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had spread the word to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/lukas/pcars/Welcome.html&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Recorder Society&lt;/a&gt; mailing list, but nobody seemed up for participating, except Chuck said he was interested in coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;preparation&#34;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had no time whatsoever to &amp;ldquo;prepare&amp;rdquo; for this music jam. We exchanged some emails only earlier today, in which I mentioned some music I might play, if a suitable accompanist were available. These emails were exchanged as Abby and I were at the second day of &lt;a href=&#34;http://podcamppittsburgh.com/pcpgh-7-sessions-sunday/&#34;&gt;PodCamp Pittsburgh 7&lt;/a&gt; all day. When we came home from PodCamp Pittsburgh, all we could do was crash with a long nap, eat dinner, and frantically pack up our instruments. I brought along a little binder of stuff I might play. I had told Ben that I could play stuff like Baroque flute sonata movements or bossa nova or tango or Cuban bolero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby has been performing in music groups longer than I have, so she has her own selections at hand for her tamburas whenever desired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;at-j-jam&#34;&gt;At J-Jam&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dunkin&amp;rsquo; Donuts was amazingly crowded. There were people of all ages, from toddlers to the elderly, sitting around listening to the live music and enjoying kosher food. It was pretty loud in there. I immediately decided that I would not play Baroque flute here. (I had brought it along with my Irish flute, modern flute, and soprano and alto recorders.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we had arrived an hour and a half past the begin time of the music jam, we had missed no shortage of performances already, I was sure. There were musicians singing and playing guitar and cello; I saw who I presumed to be Ben Rosner accompanying on mandolin at the time:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/j-jam-2012-10-28/1.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Musicians in the middle of performing&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;meeting-ben-and-deciding-what-to-do&#34;&gt;Meeting Ben and deciding what to do&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/j-jam-2012-10-28/2.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Patrons in Dunkin&amp;#39; Donuts&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After the current musicians&amp;rsquo; set, Ben came up to Abby and me, and said we could play after a couple more groups had their turn. He asked what I wanted to play. We took a few seconds to flip through that stuff I had brought, and decided to play one of the bossa nova songs I had brought, &amp;ldquo;Chega de Saudade&amp;rdquo;: he would sight read the chords and accompany me. I chose &amp;ldquo;Chega de Saudade&amp;rdquo; because I had given a shot at it spontaneously &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/09/21/my-first-time-singing-bossa-nova-also-a-temporary-farewell-to-baroque-flute/&#34;&gt;at a party a month ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I immediately made an interesting decision: although I had originally intended to play the melody on flute, and then launch into a jazzy improvisation before concluding, I decided, based on having just &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/10/27/singing-an-irish-ballad-as-an-asian-pirate-at-a-halloween-belly-dance-hafla/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;sung&lt;/em&gt; yesterday as a pirate&lt;/a&gt;, that I was in the mood to sing, and a lot of people had been singing all evening, so I wanted to do that too. And it seemed that a voice would carry well over the conversations of the Dunkin&amp;rsquo; Donuts patrons. So I would sing the song, in Portuguese of course, and then switch into flute improvisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-lot-of-good-music-i-heard&#34;&gt;A lot of good music I heard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was really impressed by the soulful performances of everyone who showed up to sing and play instruments. Really high quality stuff.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/j-jam-2012-10-28/3.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;I-forgot-her-name&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So I heard a lot of traditional songs and Klezmer (in fact, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://cmuklezmer.weebly.com/index.html&#34;&gt;CMU Klezmer Band&lt;/a&gt; was there). Not what I usually listen to or encounter, but it was really great soaking in the different kinds of music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When one of the CMU Klezmer Band guys, the clarinetist, passed out lyrics to a particularly popular song, I even sang along, stumbling through Yiddish for the first time in my life!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/j-jam-2012-10-28/4.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;CMU Klezmer Band waiting for turn&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.boulevardoftheallies.com/&#34;&gt;Joel&lt;/a&gt;, the J-Jam co-organizer who was handling the sound system throughout, performed one of his own compositions, and then one of his young guitar students performed along with him.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/j-jam-2012-10-28/7.jpg&#34; /&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Joel and student&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;familiar-faces&#34;&gt;Familiar faces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby and I saw a number of familiar people. In Pittsburgh, if you meet someone for the first time, it seems that there are already a lot of connections through other people you already know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roz, whom &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/09/24/roaring-like-a-lion-on-a-saturday-morning/&#34;&gt;I last saw over a year ago when she was trying to sell accordions&lt;/a&gt; did some singing with the CMU Klezmer Band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://betterfly.com/75586018&#34;&gt;Cindy Harris&lt;/a&gt;, who played autoharp so beautifully at &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/09/28/another-french-music-jam-also-announcing-cats-dance/&#34;&gt;one of the French music jams I&amp;rsquo;ve gone to&lt;/a&gt; did some solo pieces on autoharp:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/j-jam-2012-10-28/8.jpg&#34; /&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Cindy Harris on autoharp&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At some point, Chuck from Pittsburgh recorder showed up. He wasn&amp;rsquo;t here to play, but came to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;abby-played-while-ben-and-i-figured-stuff-out&#34;&gt;Abby played while Ben and I figured stuff out&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Abby took her turn playing some pieces solo on tambura, Ben and I ducked to the back of the store for a minute so that we could agree on a tempo as well as have him sight read the chord progressions of &amp;ldquo;Chega de Saudade&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ben-and-me&#34;&gt;Ben and me&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben and I returned, and set up quickly (we were the last set for the night other than a guy who was going to play some solo violin to close).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt pretty awkward trying to sing &amp;ldquo;Chega de Saudade&amp;rdquo; for the first time in public, and in front of a microphone, while trying to read the Portuguese lyrics off a printout I had. (Note to self: I need to memorize these lyrics once and for all.) Ben and I had a go at it, and of course we made some mistakes, but that was expected. Then came time for me to grab my flute and improvise. Under pressure, I was less creative and accurate than I am when just improvising at home, unfortunately, but I&amp;rsquo;ll learn in time to deal with the difference in setting. Also, I botched up a place to return to, so there was confusion for a moment as Ben and I found a way to gracefully end somewhere!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;just-me&#34;&gt;Just me&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to play one more piece, solo, that I thought I would do a lot better than the bossa nova experiment, so I got my Irish flute and chose spontaneously, while flipping through my binder, to play &amp;ldquo;Waltz in the House&amp;rdquo; by Emile Benoit. I love this beautiful song, and learned it half a year ago at my &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/04/21/my-first-time-in-a-public-music-jam-intense-fun-with-chris-norman-and-david-greenberg/&#34;&gt;first public jam session&lt;/a&gt;, when I was playing on Baroque flute at the time. But of course, tonight I chose to play it on Irish flute, and I played it with the best feeling and sonority I had in me, having played it for my own pleasure and for my baby nephew many times, always with the inflections and ornamentations I feel at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People seemed to like this last piece I played. I also got a lot of comments afterwards on the beauty of the tone of my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.caseyburnsflutes.com/&#34;&gt;wooden Irish flute&lt;/a&gt;; yes, it is a lovely instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-next-j-jam&#34;&gt;The next J-Jam&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next J-Jam is already scheduled for Sunday, December 16. I hope Ben and I can come up with good stuff to play together, and with more preparation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you love music and can make it to J-Jam, please come on over to Dunkin&amp;rsquo; Donuts in Squirrel Hill then! And if you would like to perform something, email Cantor Ben Rosner at the email address in the flyer below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;next&#34;&gt;Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still rather unsatisfied with my singing. I&amp;rsquo;m going to work hard on getting my singing into better shape. The next music jam I&amp;rsquo;m in, I absolutely plan to be ready to sing much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the jazz improvisation, that&amp;rsquo;s going to take me even longer to get to where I want it. That&amp;rsquo;s going to be a major project, since I have been living mostly in the classical music world lately. But I know for sure that jazz is one place I want to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby and I had a great time at our first J-Jam, both listening and performing! It&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic Squirrel Hill community event that I hope will continue regularly, and I&amp;rsquo;m grateful to Joel and Ben for organizing it and spreading the word to have people come over to listen and perform, and I was inspired by the wonderful performances by everyone who came to share their love of music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to participating again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-of-2012-12-16&#34;&gt;(Update of 2012-12-16)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not perform in or even attend &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/events/347798348651757/&#34;&gt;J-Jam on December 16&lt;/a&gt; after all! It quickly became clear in early December, after I met up with Ben to play together, that I was getting way too busy with many other things, and even if I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been, Ben himself was busy too, such that we had no opportunity to get together again anyway to work on something to play. Furthermore, the time conflicted with the monthly meeting of the Pittsburgh Recorder Society, which I hate to miss, so I did not even show up at J-Jam in December just to watch and listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-of-2013-02-10&#34;&gt;(Update of 2013-02-10)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not perform in the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/02/10/attending-j-jam-in-squirrel-hill-but-not-playing-music-in-it/&#34;&gt;February 2013 J-Jam&lt;/a&gt; either, but did attend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/09/21/my-first-time-singing-bossa-nova-also-a-temporary-farewell-to-baroque-flute/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, I reported on &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/09/08/finally-performing-some-sonatas-for-baroque-flute/&#34;&gt;finally performing some sonatas for Baroque flute&lt;/a&gt;, at a party at my friend Henry&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, tonight, at another party of Henry&amp;rsquo;s, this time a birthday party for his father (his parents have been visiting), I ended up deciding to temporarily stop playing the Baroque flute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, more significantly: this was the &lt;em&gt;first time in my life singing a song at all as a solo vocalist with accompaniment&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why and how?!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;music-plan&#34;&gt;Music plan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since at the last party two weeks ago, I ended up playing on Baroque flute some selections from &amp;ldquo;English Airs and Dances&amp;rdquo;, this time I decided to play some other Baroque selections instead, from the &amp;ldquo;4 Scottish Sonatas&amp;rdquo; album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;at-the-party&#34;&gt;At the party&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The party was great fun. We met more people, Henry&amp;rsquo;s parents were great, we ate a lot of food, and a surprising number of people played music, including some of the young children who came to the party. Accordions, tambourines, violin, piano, me on Baroque flute, Abby on tambura, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed doing some Scottish Baroque flute sonatas with Henry, but felt frustrated, as I have for some time now, both by the difficulty of playing the Baroque flute as well as the quietness of it, particularly noticeable tonight because of the large crowd of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-i-ended-up-singing-bossa-nova-unexpectedly&#34;&gt;How I ended up singing bossa nova unexpectedly&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The musical highlight of the evening was Henry&amp;rsquo;s friends Gabe and Eric entertaining us with some virtuosic and often hilarious four-hand piano music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After they were done, Gabe hung around and periodically jammed with other people, including some who decided they wanted to sing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was so inspired that some &amp;ldquo;non-singers&amp;rdquo; (as they billed themselves) had the courage to sing, that I said, hey, I want to sing something! I didn&amp;rsquo;t have anything prepared, but asked Gabe if he could play bossa nova for me, and he said, sure, where&amp;rsquo;s a score?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said I wanted to sing my favorite, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chega_de_Saudade&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Chega de Saudade&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, so in a comic frenzy, I brought up the score on my smartphone, accessing my Dropbox. Someone gave me another smartphone so that I could do a Web search for the lyrics (which are in Portuguese, and which I have not memorized yet) and sing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gabe did what he could, but it was difficult for him to read the score off the smartphone while someone tried to scroll and zoom in on it in real time. Still, we did sort of go through the song before giving up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;breaking-the-barrier&#34;&gt;Breaking the barrier&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, this was the &lt;em&gt;first time in my life singing a song at all as a solo vocalist with accompaniment&lt;/em&gt;. I was crazy nervous, but tried not to let on that this was my first time. I didn&amp;rsquo;t do too badly, considering the ad hoc circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important thing was, &lt;em&gt;I had broken a barrier&lt;/em&gt;. I knew after this experience that &lt;em&gt;there was no turning back&lt;/em&gt;. I want to sing, &lt;em&gt;seriously&lt;/em&gt;, in the future. It&amp;rsquo;s time I started. I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to do this for &lt;em&gt;decades&lt;/em&gt;, since I was a toddler singing along to records and to TV and to myself and to my sister. The singing impulse got &lt;strong&gt;killed&lt;/strong&gt; in me in middle school by a music teacher who made me feel incompetent and unworthy at a time when that was the last thing an adolescent needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never expected that I&amp;rsquo;d get my start goofing around at a party. I have gone to karaoke-type events before, at which I &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; once considered singing, even while everyone else was doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;after-the-party&#34;&gt;After the party&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made some decisions after the party:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am switching focus from Baroque flute to modern flute (with corresponding change in repertoire) in order to play music that is more audible and more party-friendly. I want to be playing bossa nova, for example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am going to start working on voice, so that I can sing at the next party of Henry&amp;rsquo;s, whenever that will be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I&amp;rsquo;m going to sing bossa nova seriously, I need to know Portuguese better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet another musical party has &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/01/27/a-new-friends-very-musical-birthday-party-changed-my-life/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;changed my life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I now sing. Also, with some sadness, I am taking a break from Baroque flute.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Latin jazz in Pittsburgh: Puro Queso</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/08/26/latin-jazz-in-pittsburgh-puro-queso/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 26 Aug 2012 22:31:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/08/26/latin-jazz-in-pittsburgh-puro-queso/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One great thing about Pittsburgh is the free cultural programs at the Carnegie Library. Abby and I checked out a local Latin jazz quartet, &lt;a href=&#34;http://puroquesojazz.com/&#34;&gt;Puro Queso&lt;/a&gt;, performing at the main branch of the library in Oakland, as part of their regular &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.carnegielibrary.org/events/details.cfm?event_id=69113&#34;&gt;Sunday afternoon World Kaleidoscope series&lt;/a&gt;. This event was also posted on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/pittsburgh-free/events/77709582/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Free and Almost Free in Pittsburgh&amp;rdquo; meetup group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was amused to notice that when we arrived, I recognized the saxophonist! It was someone I had seen around a lot on campus at work at CMU. I figured he must be staff or faculty. (I looked him up and sure enough, he is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.history.cmu.edu/faculty/eiss.html&#34;&gt;Paul Eiss, professor in the history department&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/puro-queso/soprano-sax.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Paul Eiss on soprano sax&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/puro-queso/tenor-sax.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As usual at these library events, where time is limited and the purpose is to spark interest not only in the music but also to encourage concert attendance and CD purchases, the mustical selections tended toward well-known classic crowd pleasers, rather than more adventurous material or wilder improvisation. In any case, it was fun, and Abby and I danced a little too. Some of the selections I recognized:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bossa nova: Song of the Jet (&lt;a href=&#34;http://letras.mus.br/tom-jobim/49065/&#34;&gt;Samba do Avião&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bossa nova: &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mas_que_Nada&#34;&gt;Mas Que Nada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bolero: &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9same_Mucho&#34;&gt;Besame mucho&lt;/a&gt;, featuring a female vocalist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a Cuban &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_%28music%29&#34;&gt;son&lt;/a&gt; whose name I have forgotten&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Flute update: celebrating Bach&#39;s birthday, using a Thumbport, improvising to bossa nova</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/03/21/flute-update-celebrating-bachs-birthday/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been eleven days since &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/03/10/flute-loving-it-again/&#34;&gt;my last blog post on my flute progress&lt;/a&gt;. During this time, there have been various changes in my life, including &lt;em&gt;radical&lt;/em&gt; changes in my musical life. It will take me a couple of additional blog posts to discuss these changes, but for now, I&amp;rsquo;ll talk only about today&amp;rsquo;s snapshot of my flute activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-of-2012-03-12&#34;&gt;(Update of 2012-03-12)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had ended up &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/03/12/quitting-the-cmu-all-university-orchestra-one-of-the-hardest-decisions-in-my-life/&#34;&gt;quitting the CMU AUO&lt;/a&gt;, and then having a &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/03/17/st-patricks-day-party-playing-tin-whistle-and-flute/&#34;&gt;wonderful musical experience a birthday party&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;thumbport&#34;&gt;Thumbport&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://www.thumbport.com/images/position.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Thumbport&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Today I received a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thumbport.com/&#34;&gt;Thumbport II&lt;/a&gt; I ordered recently. It&amp;rsquo;s a snap-on device that helps with holding a flute, by making it easier to balance the flute on the right thumb, thereby decreasing rolling of the flute and pressure on the right pinkie finger. I tried it for the first time today and it seems useful. We&amp;rsquo;ll see if it helps a bit with my form and &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/03/07/flute-taking-a-break-while-clarifying-my-goals/&#34;&gt;injury issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-celebrated-the-327th-birthday-of-johann-sebastian-bach&#34;&gt;I celebrated the 327th birthday of Johann Sebastian Bach&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t follow celebrity birthdays, but I could not avoid hearing about the birthday of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach&#34;&gt;Johann Sebastian Bach, born in 1685&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to some music blogs I follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to celebrate? The last time I celebrated a composer&amp;rsquo;s birthday, it was last October, for Franz Liszt&amp;rsquo;s 200th birthday. Then, I listened to a piece of music by the composer and &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/22/happy-200th-birthday/&#34;&gt;wrote up my impressions of it&lt;/a&gt;. Today, I again had the option to read about Bach or his music, and but I mostly chose to play his music, in order to celebrate as &lt;em&gt;actively&lt;/em&gt; as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;playing-the-cello-suite-no-1-in-g-major-bwv-1007&#34;&gt;Playing the cello suite no. 1 in G major, BWV 1007&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sight read a bunch of old Bach&amp;rsquo;s music that eventually I should practice seriously to play well, including various minuets and bourrées.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the main piece I sight read was the full &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cello_Suites_(Bach)&#34;&gt;cello suite&lt;/a&gt; no. 1 in G major, using an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pjb.com.au/mus/arr.html&#34;&gt;arrangement for flute by Peter Billam&lt;/a&gt;. (I had actually obtained this a long time ago intending to play it on alto &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/recorder/&#34;&gt;recorder&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This music is deceptively simple but really quite beautiful. Even visually it is pleasing: check out Bach&amp;rsquo;s handwritten score:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h4 id=&#34;visual-animation&#34;&gt;Visual animation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, you must check out the following unconventional visual animated representation of this music (see the creator&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.chenalexander.com/2011/baroque-bach-cello/&#34;&gt;blog post about its construction&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;bossa-nova&#34;&gt;Bossa nova&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Today I also picked up from the public library another play-along score/CD set, this time a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.halleonard.com/product/viewproduct.do?itemid=843016&amp;amp;lid=1&amp;amp;keywords=latin&amp;amp;seriesfeature=JZPLYA&amp;amp;&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Latin jazz&amp;rdquo; collection&lt;/a&gt;. Apart from the famous mambo &amp;ldquo;Ran Kan Kan&amp;rdquo; by Tito Puente, the rest was actually bossa nova, which was what I got it for. Recently I decided to get more into playing jazz and working on improvisation. Since I love the harmonies and tunes of classic bossa nova, I decided this was a good place to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a lot of fun playing around with the accompaniment CD. Actually, I would also like to sing this music, but unlike with salsa and bolero, where I am completely comfortable singing in Spanish, I am not proficient in the Portuguese language and it trips me up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just thought I&amp;rsquo;d provide a short update on some of my current musical activities, until I have time to write about the big changes I&amp;rsquo;ve made in my musical life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-musical-tangent-bach-s-goldberg-variations&#34;&gt;A musical tangent: Bach&amp;rsquo;s Goldberg Variations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In turns out there is a whole series of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/148455347/goldberg-week&#34;&gt;posts on the NPR music blog about the Goldberg Variations&lt;/a&gt;. I could not resist dipping into this series, because I am a Goldberg geek. I would like someday to get good enough on piano to play much of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
