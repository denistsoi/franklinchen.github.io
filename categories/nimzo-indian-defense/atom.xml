      <title>World Chess Championship 2013 round 9: I correctly predicted Anand&#39;s aggressively opening choice but he blundered horribly again to lose</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my continuing coverage of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://chennai2013.fide.com/&#34;&gt;World Chess Championship between Anand and Carlsen&lt;/a&gt;, today I cover round nine, in which Anand finally went for the big win, but blundered horribly and lost instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The night before the game, five hours before it started, I &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/franklinchen/status/403370754336505858&#34;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It came to me in a dream: Anand playing d4 in the next round, then going for an f3, e4 Pawn storm against Carlsen #FWCM2013
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to admit to being proud of myself for having correctly predicted the opening that both players would willingly enter in today&amp;rsquo;s game! I had been thinking about this even before the match, but apparently Anand didn&amp;rsquo;t pull out his weapon until just now. Today, I explain my reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Game and notes below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-correct-opening-prediction&#34;&gt;My correct opening prediction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-d4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;1 d4&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I concluded weeks ago that Anand would have to play &lt;code&gt;1 d4&lt;/code&gt; for the win against Carlsen, as he did against Kramnik in 2008 and Topalov in 2010. I know this is a topic for a post in itself, but I think &lt;code&gt;1 e4&lt;/code&gt; is dead at an elite match level if Black is willing to play &lt;code&gt;1... e5&lt;/code&gt; in response. Alternatively, even in his successful defense of his title against Gelfand in 2012, Anand&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;1 e4&lt;/code&gt; was neutralized by Gelfand&amp;rsquo;s use of the Sicilian &lt;code&gt;1... c5&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;nimzo-indian&#34;&gt;Nimzo-Indian&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I predicted that Carlsen would play the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimzo-Indian_Defence&#34;&gt;Nimzo-Indian&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Indian_Defense&#34;&gt;Queen&amp;rsquo;s Indian Defense&lt;/a&gt; opening complex in response to &lt;code&gt;1 d4&lt;/code&gt;. Very solid, dynamic opening choice for Black.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the Queen&amp;rsquo;s Indian Defense is mostly dead at the elite level, thanks to computer-aided analysis of some of the most important lines that lead to forced draws. Therefore, for Anand to play for the big win would require accepting the Nimzo-Indian challenge, creating positional asymmetries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;white-against-the-nimzo-indian&#34;&gt;White against the Nimzo-Indian&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to play White against the Nimzo-Indian. As White I have tried many of them. The question is, what is the most aggressive way to play against the Nimzo-Indian? I think the answer is clear: &lt;code&gt;f3&lt;/code&gt; aiming for an eventual &lt;code&gt;e4&lt;/code&gt; and King side attack, involving &lt;code&gt;f4&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;e5&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;f5&lt;/code&gt; trying to checkmate Black&amp;rsquo;s King!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some years ago, a nice book by Yuri Yakovich came out, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gambitbooks.com/books/Play_the_4_f3_Nimzo-Indian.html&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Play the 4 f3 Nimzo-Indian&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; which covers the ideas behind this way of playing for White. There are, of course, reasons why this is not played so often at top levels. Basically, the plan is risky, because White risks getting a weak &lt;code&gt;c3&lt;/code&gt; Pawn, being underdeveloped, or overextended, while Black gets counterplay on the Queen side. But in a must-win situation, I expected Anand to pull out this opening variation as a weapon eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has done this before. In his &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=65865&#34;&gt;2008 match against Kramnik&lt;/a&gt;, he played against the Nimzo-Indian using this &lt;code&gt;f3&lt;/code&gt; variation in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1510259&#34;&gt;Round 2&lt;/a&gt;. Kramnik drew, but White had a good game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary-of-the-game&#34;&gt;Summary of the game&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carlsen characteristically avoided the most popular &amp;ldquo;main line&amp;rdquo; against the &lt;code&gt;f3&lt;/code&gt; Nimzo-Indian, and in fact even transposed into a line of the Saemisch Variation that for a long time, since Botvinnik&amp;rsquo;s famous winning games in it, had been considered bad for Black.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we have computers now that correct a lot of old assumptions. As a result, Carlsen played the most aggressive counterattacking plan right off the bat, going straight for Queen side counterplay before White even began developing the King side! Both players proceeded completely thematically and predictably after that, launching Pawns forward on opposite sides of the board. The question was whether Anand could break through on the King side first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carlsen cold-bloodedly assumed not, and played aggressively with &lt;code&gt;b3&lt;/code&gt; creating a possibly dangerous passed Pawn, even as Anand prepared &lt;code&gt;f6&lt;/code&gt; trapping Carlsen&amp;rsquo;s King.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably objectively the position is defensible for Black. But Anand thought he saw a checkmate coming, and let Carlsen Queen the &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; Pawn while lifting his Rook up to deliver a checkmate threat. Alas, he completely missed that &lt;code&gt;Qe1&lt;/code&gt; stops the checkmate and White is dead lost, and had to resign. (It turns out that at the last moment, Anand could easily have forced a draw with &lt;code&gt;Bf1&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this game, it is possible that if Anand had played a slower, less &amp;ldquo;objectively correct&amp;rdquo; line of attack, the game could have gotten interesting, in case Carlsen faltered. But unfortunately, we did not see that more interesting development of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-state-of-the-match&#34;&gt;The state of the match&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carlsen has basically won the match. Carlsen already has 6 out of 12 points. He needs only one draw in the next 3 rounds in order to claim the title of FIDE World Chess Champion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s up to Anand to continue doing the best he can regardless of the inevitable result. It will be tough, especially since he just blundered &lt;em&gt;horrifically&lt;/em&gt; again in a position that should have been a draw.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;PCC Championship 2013 round 1&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was the first round in the annual &lt;a href=&#34;http://pittsburghcc.org/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Chess Club&lt;/a&gt; Championship, and I am playing in it for the first time in two years. I &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/10/09/final-round-of-pittsburgh-chess-club-tournament-clawing-back-from-a-terrible-position-to-draw-and-tie-for-first/&#34;&gt;mentioned earlier&lt;/a&gt; that I have won the PCC Champion title twice, in 2006 and 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;special-prizes&#34;&gt;Special prizes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m excited that this year the format has been augmented with some special prizes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best Attack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best Defense&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biggest Upset&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All players have been invited to submit their game scores for consideration for these prizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; submitting my game score from round 1! Although I won my game, bit was a result of a swindle in which I lured my opponent into walking into danger in an otherwise drawish endgame, after which he suddenly completely fell apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, most chess games played by humans are &amp;ldquo;ugly&amp;rdquo; like this in some way (and I have written posts about how I have been on the receiving end of swindles), so we have to embrace this reality; most games also have their cute moments. I think my game is worth looking at for the swindle that worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-complete-annotated-game&#34;&gt;The complete annotated game&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At your convenience, you can &lt;a href=&#34;../../chess/chen-kostyak-2013-01-15.htm&#34;&gt;enjoy playing over the game with my annotations, including diagrams&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;preparation&#34;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This being the first round, I had no idea who my opponent would be, so had nothing to prepare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t played a single game of chess in an entire month, so I expected to be a bit rusty. My goal was to maintain some kind of advantage, while avoiding plain losing for no reason. In the past, I have sometimes forgotten to avoid losing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;this-year-s-tournament&#34;&gt;This year&amp;rsquo;s tournament&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tournament has a great turnout, and Mike Holsinger, the director, noted that it is possible that we have one of the strongest fields in the history of this tournament. There are quite a few rated Experts other than me. I look forward to facing strong competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview-of-my-game&#34;&gt;Overview of my game&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was paired against Mike Kostyak, rated nearly 500 rating points below me at 1733. Ratings are deceptive though: I&amp;rsquo;ve had plenty of trouble, sometimes, winning against opponents much lower rated than me. This game was no exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the board, I only recalled that I had played a couple of tournament games with Mike several years ago, when he was White, but never Black, and we have played some blitz also, but I had no memory of what openings he played as Black.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-opening&#34;&gt;The opening&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I did in &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/12/18/round-6-of-pittsburgh-chess-club-tournament-playing-pragmatically/&#34;&gt;my last-played tournament game&lt;/a&gt; as White, I deliberately invited the Nimzo-Indian Defense. I like the challenge of &amp;ldquo;winning&amp;rdquo; the two Bishops and trying to make something out of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than my bafflingly messing up a move order that could have been punished, we arrived at a thematic position out of the opening in which I had the advantage of the two Bishops as well as more space. I considered this a large advantage, but Black&amp;rsquo;s position is solid and not the easiest to penetrate.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../chess/chen-kostyak-2013-01-15_files/diag3FA3327DD5CEE3F6.gif&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Nimzo&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-middlegame&#34;&gt;The middlegame&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began missing the most promising continuations during the middlegame, but still retained an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things got complicated after Mike found a nice move to break up my Queen side Pawn structure and activate his Knight with &lt;code&gt;a5&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../chess/chen-kostyak-2013-01-15_files/diag3FA332FBAA10194B.gif&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Nice tactic by Black&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Inexplicably, he decided to actually sacrifice the &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; Pawn rather than regain it, and I was of course happy to get an extra Pawn. Nevertheless, I started making very strange passive moves, and even panicked and make a weakening move &lt;code&gt;f4&lt;/code&gt; that I knew would considerably reduce winning chances for me, because of giving up control over the &lt;code&gt;e4&lt;/code&gt; square. &lt;code&gt;Re2&lt;/code&gt; would have retained a large advantage instead:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../chess/chen-kostyak-2013-01-15_files/diag3FA33340CAEB3B55.gif&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;White faltered with f4&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-endgame&#34;&gt;The endgame&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, Mike chose, instead of keeping the pressure on my position, to offer a trade of Queens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was ecstatic to take off the Queens&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the Queens were off, I felt safe in having a small advantage, being a Pawn up in the endgame. Also, here is a secret of &lt;em&gt;practical&lt;/em&gt; chess: the stronger player usually benefits from going into an advantageous endgame. You see this at all levels: a stronger player often wins a supposedly drawn endgame; this happens whether at the level of Grandmasters beating Masters, Masters beating Experts, or Class A players beating Class C players. So usually it is not beneficial for a weaker player to deliberately go into a disadvantageous ending, unless that player is stronger at the endgame than at other phases of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, from my perspective as the stronger player, it was clear that the way things were going, a draw was not only objectively the correct result, but also very probable. If I played the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; moves, I would only force my opponent to play &lt;em&gt;obvious&lt;/em&gt; responses that lead to a draw. So I needed a way to encourage my opponent to play strange moves. This is how &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; chess differs completely from &lt;em&gt;computer&lt;/em&gt; chess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-sacrifice&#34;&gt;A sacrifice&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to deliberately sacrifice a Pawn in order to gain enough time to activate some of my pieces. I entered an entire line with the purpose of trying to sacrifice my &lt;code&gt;g3&lt;/code&gt; Pawn. Mike followed the line I wanted him to play:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../chess/chen-kostyak-2013-01-15_files/diag3FA333807BE326EB.gif&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;g3 Pawn sacrifice&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Instead of protecting the Pawn, I gave it up deliberately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were two dangers in this swindling attempt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He did not have to take the Pawn, and in fact, it was easy to draw by refusing to take it and playing a more active move instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even after taking the Pawn, he could still hold the new position, and I could have lost the Pawn for &amp;ldquo;nothing&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in reality, since I accepted that a draw was possible and OK, losing the Pawn while not ending up in a worse position was OK. The problem in swindling is if you sacrifice material and end up in a worse position and risk losing. There was no risk in losing in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I hate to say it given my love for the aspect of chess that is purely logical, but it is sensible, when playing someone you know, and who is weaker than you, that you may be able to predict, from human psychology, what will happen, and therefore playing a speculative move may be the &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; thing to do in order to preserve winning chances. I was so sure that my opponent would take the sacrificed Pawn that it seemed like I had to go that route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;blunders&#34;&gt;Blunders&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reached a position I aimed at all along:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../chess/chen-kostyak-2013-01-15_files/diag3FA3338E7706D783.gif&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;After sacrifice&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At the cost of a Pawn, I managed to fully activate all of my pieces. My Rooks are ready for action, and my dark Bishop is optimally placed, and has forced Black&amp;rsquo;s Rook into passivity on &lt;code&gt;e7&lt;/code&gt;. Objectively, Black should still be able to draw, but this kind of position is very different from the kind of position that would exist if I had not sacrificed the &lt;code&gt;g3&lt;/code&gt; Pawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black immediately blundered horribly, and we reached this position, which is winning for White, who can fork the Rook and Knight with &lt;code&gt;Bd6&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../chess/chen-kostyak-2013-01-15_files/diag3FA333BE3BC0C833.gif&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;White winning&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I was in a state of annoyance at this point, because in his previous move, &lt;code&gt;Nxb7&lt;/code&gt;, the losing move before &lt;code&gt;Nc5&lt;/code&gt;, Mike had &lt;em&gt;offered a draw&lt;/em&gt;!! That distracted me, I got confused, played quickly, and made an elementary error here, &lt;code&gt;Rb8+&lt;/code&gt;, which should have allowed a draw again, but Mike did not see the error, and we reached a different critical position:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../chess/chen-kostyak-2013-01-15_files/diag3FA333CB700D27DF.gif&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;White might win&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h4 id=&#34;reassessment&#34;&gt;Reassessment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point a bunch of spectators had gathered, and Mike was sighing, because we all saw &lt;code&gt;Bd6&lt;/code&gt;, of course. But I suspected (correctly) that I had been overexcited in the past couple of moves, and wanted to calm down in order to make sure that it was the winning move. I spent a lot of time (since I was way ahead on the clock anyway) just calming down. Then I saw clearly that &lt;code&gt;Bd6&lt;/code&gt; would not win, because Black has &lt;code&gt;Rb7&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was upset that I had missed a win, but at the same time, I still had a very good chance of winning, because Black will lose the &lt;code&gt;h7&lt;/code&gt; Pawn. The resulting ending is probably hard for Black to defend. So I calmly played &lt;code&gt;Rh8&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Mike blundered for the final time, trying to save the &lt;code&gt;h7&lt;/code&gt; Pawn rather than saving his Knight from being forked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some spectators afterwards thought Mike should have played &lt;code&gt;Ne4&lt;/code&gt; to save the Knight, but actually, it loses quickly, because of &lt;code&gt;c5&lt;/code&gt;, after which the Pawn is taboo because of the fork, but will advance to Queen if Black does not take it:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../chess/chen-kostyak-2013-01-15_files/diag3FA333DEDB140EEA.gif&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;White may Queen&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The final position of our game:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../chess/chen-kostyak-2013-01-15_files/diag3FA333F30CF246E2.gif&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Final position&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-to-take-away-from-the-game&#34;&gt;Lessons to take away from the game&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When your opponent&amp;rsquo;s position is passive, do not relieve the pressure by offering piece trades unnecessarily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A stronger player has more to gain by entering into an advantageous (even if objectively drawable) ending.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes it makes sense to try a swindle, if the risk is low and psychology begs for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not be startled and annoyed by an opponent&amp;rsquo;s offer of a draw breaking the silence after over three hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not get overexcited when seeing a win. Double check before moving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-next&#34;&gt;What next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week for round 2, I am Black against Melih Ozbek, whom I&amp;rsquo;ve played once before, two years ago, when I was the one who was White. He is rated 1947, less than 200 points below me, so I&amp;rsquo;d better be less rusty than I was last night. I have no clue what openings he plays as White, so I&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy having to be completely spontaneous next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a tough game in round 1, in which my lower-rated opponent, despite having a worse position out of the opponent, put up counterplay that threw me off guard, and then forced me into an endgame that was objectively drawable. But I swindled him and won.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        &lt;h4&gt;Black Ne4 sacrifice&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Last week in &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/12/11/round-5-of-pittsburgh-chess-club-tournament-psychology-of-losing-another-won-game/&#34;&gt;round 5&lt;/a&gt;, I reported on a disastrous game I played in which I was mentally unbalanced and lost, for the second time in the current &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pittsburghcc.org/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Chess Club&lt;/a&gt; tournament, a game in which I was winning and went into an endgame one Pawn up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this week&amp;rsquo;s game, I also ended up in an endgame one Pawn up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I played pragmatically this time. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain what that means and why it is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-complete-annotated-game&#34;&gt;The complete annotated game&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At your convenience, you can &lt;a href=&#34;../../chess/chen-schreiber-2012-12-18.htm&#34;&gt;enjoy playing over the game with my annotations, including diagrams.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;preparation&#34;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I had lost two games in a row, I was paired against an opponent, Jeff, of considerably lower rating than me, at his floor of 1900.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeff had been much stronger in many years ago but after a visit to the hospital several years ago that resulted in his fighting for a year just to survive at all, he has never regained his former strength. I am very happy that he is back to stable health at all. He is a real asset to the Pittsburgh Chess Club, serving as a steward who opens and closes the club, answers the phone, etc: he was the very first person I met when I stopped by the club for the first time eight years ago, and he was so kind and helpful as I came back to chess after a two-decade absence that I decided to join the club and began playing in tournaments again in 2005. I owe Jeff for my return to chess play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for my record against Jeff, I had only played one game as White against him, in 2006, and lost when I failed to continue my attack properly against his Sicilian; I have won three games as Black against him in 2005, 2006, and 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had no time or energy to devote to any special preparation for our game. In fact, I was so exhausted after the past couple of days (that included performing music at the annual &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/12/14/pittsburgh-contras-and-squares-holiday-ball-2012/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Contras and Squares Holiday Ball&lt;/a&gt; that I spent the weekend feeling as though I was going to get sick, slept a massive amount on both Saturday and Sunday, and on Sunday decided that I would take Monday (yesterday) off from work in order to continue to recover my health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I did only two things to prepare for the final (whew) round of the chess tournament:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t do anything &lt;strong&gt;stupid&lt;/strong&gt; (the way I did in the last two tournament games).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As White, I had some control over the opening. I anticipated that he would play a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimzo-Indian_Defence&#34;&gt;Nimzo-Indian&lt;/a&gt; against me if I let him, and I saw no reason to prevent him from doing so. I am very happy to play White against the Nimzo-Indian.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview-of-my-game&#34;&gt;Overview of my game&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-opening&#34;&gt;The opening&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I half-expected, Jeff played the Nimzo-Indian against me. We entered a variation that favors White.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../chess/chen-schreiber-2012-12-18_files/diag3FEF9E591F75D725.gif&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Nimzo-Indian&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-middle-game&#34;&gt;The middle game&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended up in a strange position in which Jeff for some reason chose to sacrifice his &lt;code&gt;g7&lt;/code&gt; Pawn for some activity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../chess/chen-schreiber-2012-12-18_files/diag3FEF9E5EB4A16CC5.gif&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Black Ne4 sacrifice&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I took the Pawn, and then made a pragmatic decision to start simplifying to an endgame. This was not the strongest continuation, but I made this decision because frankly, I was very tired and my highest priority was to avoid a pointless loss caused by inability to calculate properly. So I wanted to simplify. In my last two games, I also deliberately chose to simplify, but then did not follow up consistently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan this time was to be consistent: play into a Pawn-up endgame where I had &lt;em&gt;no chance of losing&lt;/em&gt; and where I was the only one with &lt;em&gt;any chance of winning&lt;/em&gt;. Then I would sit and wait until my opponent made errors. If he didn&amp;rsquo;t and therefore held the draw, then so be it. I was tired of just plain losing out of time pressure and fatigue. I decided to stay ahead on the clock in a superior endgame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-endgame&#34;&gt;The endgame&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I forced an exchange of Queens and even traded off Bishops.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../chess/chen-schreiber-2012-12-18_files/diag3FEF9E61CFFEB075.gif&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Drawn endgame?&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Objectively, this endgame should be a draw, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what is &amp;ldquo;objectivity&amp;rdquo; when I&amp;rsquo;m tired, and my opponent is over 200 rating points weaker than I am? In the end, chess is a human struggle of imperfection. My goal in this game was simply to avoid losing while preserving chances for a win, to close out this tournament with some honor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a single move, pushing &lt;code&gt;d5&lt;/code&gt;, Jeff finally blundered into a lost game.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../chess/chen-schreiber-2012-12-18_files/diag3FEF9E6666666666.gif&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Black loses&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Again, after this blunder, which loses a second Pawn (because Black ends up with too many weak isolated Pawns), I continued to play pragmatically. I didn&amp;rsquo;t look for the fastest win, the most elegant. I looked for what I felt to be the &lt;em&gt;safest&lt;/em&gt; win. I played to prevent Black from any chances at &lt;em&gt;counterplay&lt;/em&gt;. I slowly pushed my central Pawn mass, rather than go for some faster win that would rely on fewer of my forces but require more calculation. The last two weeks of playing in a tired physical and mental state showed that I could not trust my calculations. On the other hand, if I played relatively mindless but obviously good moves, rather than looking for the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; moves, I could guarantee a win eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so I did.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../chess/chen-schreiber-2012-12-18_files/diag3FEF9E712D51E931.gif&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Black resigned&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-learned&#34;&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was nothing very exciting about this game. It was just a game in which I had an advantage straight out of the opening and &lt;em&gt;was never worse&lt;/em&gt; and also never played the best moves at interesting points in the game. I only played &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo; moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only show this game to illustrate what it means to play pragmatically when outside forces dictate that this is the correct thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am human; if I am tired, I must play differently than when I am fully rested and mentally sharp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the goal is to win, against a weaker opponent, it is often enough to just maintain an advantage, even in an objectively drawn endgame, because if he could always draw this kind of endgame, then he would have a higher rating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-next&#34;&gt;What next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m totally exhausted from the past two months of my life, and ready for the winter holidays, during which I expect to mostly just stay at home and recharge, and figure out my plans for the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m absolutely certain now that next year I should not play again in this annual Tuesday night tournament that spans November and December. This is a bad time of year for me in terms of all the things that pile up on me at the end of the year. The historical record: I played terribly in this tournament also in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uschess.org/msa/XtblMain.php?201012144091-12226800&#34;&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uschess.org/msa/XtblMain.php?200812165511-12226800&#34;&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;. I should have thought about this trend before signing up this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will decide by New Year whether to play in the next Tuesday night tournament. Part of me clearly wants to continue with my chess explorations, but I really have to take into account what other commitments I&amp;rsquo;ll be making for January and February, to make sure I don&amp;rsquo;t play chess tired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;followup-report-on-the-tournament&#34;&gt;Followup report on the tournament&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two guys I lost to in rounds 4 and 5 played each other to decide first place in the tournament. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uschess.org/msa/XtblMain.php?201212180392&#34;&gt;Ed ended up winning&lt;/a&gt;. I saw part of the game before I finished mine and left, and will comment on it in my next chess blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went into this final round of the chess tournament with a clear goal, and a clear method of achieving it, which was to play pragmatically and get the win. I accomplished this non-glamorous goal, and hope that in the future, I will be more deliberately pragmatic in my play in general.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
