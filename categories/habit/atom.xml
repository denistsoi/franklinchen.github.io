&lt;p&gt;Abby and I came up with a very useful way of dealing with a type of conflict in marriage that seems pretty common: that of one person being annoyed by the other&amp;rsquo;s bad habit, and repeatedly, because the other person after being criticized promises to change but doesn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for the failure to change is not necessarily malice, of course. Just taking myself as an example, I reflected on which changes I have made during marriage and which I have not, and tried to understand why I might &amp;ldquo;forget&amp;rdquo; one thing and not another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that the answer was usually surprisingly simple, and must reflect on human nature in general. When there is something annoying I do and Abby just goes relentlessly negative on me, I am &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; likely to actually correct my behavior, even if I grudgingly acknowledge that I should change it. But if she told me in a loving way, I was more likely to catch myself in the future in the relevant situation, and either do what she wanted or not do what she did not want me to do!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I have said here also applies to the exact opposite situation when Abby annoys me and I harp on her. The more vocal I am, the more insistent, the less effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, this was just as true when I was a child also. I suppose we all still have a little child inside of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;one-part-of-the-solution&#34;&gt;One part of the solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no silver bullet for &amp;ldquo;making people change&amp;rdquo;, but the thing is to have them want to change and make it easy, rather than demand it. We are human, not robots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that when I get a hug, at the same time as when being told gently of something that I should do, I am more likely to remember the task, and associate it with something positive, and actually do it. It seems that when I am yelled at, the effect is to actually associate the task with a negative memory and block it out of my consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, you could say, this is crazy childish behavior, that &amp;ldquo;adults&amp;rdquo; should just take responsibility and do the right thing. That&amp;rsquo;s why Abby used to say and I used to say. It leads to an escalating arms race of &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m better than you&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;hug system&amp;rdquo; seems to work a lot better for us, we found out to our surprise. If it works with human nature and the other way doesn&amp;rsquo;t, then theories about how we &amp;ldquo;should&amp;rdquo; know how to behave kind of don&amp;rsquo;t matter. Results matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I had known about this earlier. Unfortunately, the authoritarian way in which I was raised led me to internalize the psychologically dubious assumption that &lt;em&gt;tone doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter; reasoning and truth and right matter, and it is the purely the job of the offender to do all the work&lt;/em&gt;. I now totally disagree with that. &lt;em&gt;Tone matters, whether or not you believe it should.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The toilet seats are always down now at home, as well as a large number of other little things I now remember to do that I mysteriously did not before. Maybe in theory I should have been able to get this all working no matter whether I was getting yelled at or not. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m a weak, irrational husband, a sad excuse of a human being. Or maybe imperfection only needs a little bit of help to do a lot better.&lt;/p&gt;
