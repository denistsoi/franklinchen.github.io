      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/03/22/paradox-i-will-observe-the-national-day-of-unplugging-but-just-bought-my-first-smartphone-this-week/&#34;&gt;The past 24 hours&lt;/a&gt;, I observed the &lt;a href=&#34;http://nationaldayofunplugging.org/&#34;&gt;National Day of Unplugging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a report on what I learned during that experience. I will be working on that report, which will probably be spread out over multiple posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a report of what I did, &amp;ldquo;plugged in&amp;rdquo;, right after the event ended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-immediately-did-after-finishing-the-national-day-of-unplugging&#34;&gt;What I immediately did after finishing the National Day of Unplugging&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made a phone call to Abby, who has been in North Carolina since yesterday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turned on my home computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Announced on Facebook and Twitter that I was back from unplugging! (Funny that this is the first thing I did online.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checked my emails: I have around 30 to deal with. That&amp;rsquo;s not bad, but I know that usually, I receive the least email on Saturdays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started to &amp;ldquo;catch up&amp;rdquo; on my RSS feeds, Facebook, Twitter, Google+.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;emails-i-missed&#34;&gt;Emails I missed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notification about a Meetup event for tomorrow morning. If I had known about it earlier, I might have planned today differently. It is &amp;ldquo;too late&amp;rdquo; now to change tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s plans, so I will not be attending that event. (There is a different Meetup event I&amp;rsquo;m going to in the afternoon.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notification about multiple Meetup events further in the future I may be interested in attending; need to look at the details and add to my online calendar if I decide to go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Party invitation on Facebook. &lt;strong&gt;This is why I can&amp;rsquo;t quit Facebook; people actually use it.&lt;/strong&gt; Need to look at my online calendar and discuss with Abby.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing old and new email threads involving various friends; I need to catch up and participate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notifications about new comments in my blog&amp;rsquo;s threads and other people&amp;rsquo;s blogs&amp;rsquo; threads where I&amp;rsquo;d indicated I want to be notified; sometimes this is useful, but other times less so. I will respond promptly to the comment on my old blog post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never-ending emails about new bills and statements I need to inspect and deal with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notifications about a bunch of new people following me on Twitter. I&amp;rsquo;ve long since given up on looking up every single new follower (or unfollower). I do like to make note of Pittsburgh locals I may have met in person or should meet, however.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various mailing lists and other notifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;facebook&#34;&gt;Facebook&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, so it took about 15 minutes to catch up on browsing Facebook. That&amp;rsquo;s actually longer than I expected. Typically I check Facebook once or twice a day, and I&amp;rsquo;ve imagined that I don&amp;rsquo;t spend more than 5 minutes a day on Facebook, but apparently I&amp;rsquo;m wrong. Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe I should spend less time on Facebook, because in reality, most of what I see there is not really necessary for me to see; it&amp;rsquo;s just idle people-watching for me, and the value of that is unclear to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;google&#34;&gt;Google+&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest: I spend very little time on Google+. It&amp;rsquo;s just not where most people I know (as in &amp;ldquo;non-geeks&amp;rdquo;) are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;rss-feeds&#34;&gt;RSS feeds&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of articles to sort through. For fun, as I go through them to save those I cannot just skim in 15 seconds, but want to read in depth later, I am listing the topics of the saved ones here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eclipse plugin for automatic Javadoc comments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improvised Persian music for Nowruz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Claims that Twitter Bootstrap is the way to go for web site design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Privacy and how to pay for it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formal mathematical model of film success or failure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to fix local issues: government or not?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stresses on women in today&amp;rsquo;s world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plight of the introvert&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calibre and freedom for ebooks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guido and callbacks in Python&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new blogging platform called Svbtle (sic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collection of historical chess footage on YouTube&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday is a slow day. On a weekday I typically find more new stuff to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;twitter&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I hit Twitter, to scroll down and see what I missed. I get tremendous value from Twitter, actually, that I cannot get from other sources. Perhaps that is the subject for a future blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-new-smartphone&#34;&gt;My new smartphone&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still need to get going on setting up and really using my new smartphone. This task may need to wait until Monday or Tuesday, since I have a lot of stuff I need to get done tonight and tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about the first things I&amp;rsquo;ve done after getting back online. I&amp;rsquo;ll continue monitoring my online activities as they happen. One thing &amp;ldquo;unplugging&amp;rdquo; has done for me is give me (at least temporarily) a more conscious than usual awareness of what I do online. This will be a step toward streamlining my online activities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
