      <description>

&lt;p&gt;It was a little crazy, but right after I came home from a mega-long &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/05/12/my-rachel-carson-trail-hike-for-the-year/&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Trail hike today&lt;/a&gt;, I rushed to shower and change and run over to a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chathambaroque.org/events/pleasures-purcell&#34;&gt;special concert, &amp;ldquo;The Pleasures of Purcell&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chathambaroque.org/&#34;&gt;Chatham Baroque&lt;/a&gt; at the local &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.redeemerpittsburgh.org/&#34;&gt;Church of the Redeemer&lt;/a&gt; in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood. Objectively, I should have just called it a day after the hike, but I love the Chatham Baroque and learning from Annie earlier that they were playing in the neighborhood just several blocks from where I live made me decide to hop over there. (The concert was free to the public, but welcomed donations, of course: please remember to contribute generously when you attend these kinds of community good will events!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I attended in part because the musical genre was basically new to me: choral music by Henry Purcell. This is not my kind of thing, but I&amp;rsquo;m old enough that I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten tired of only listening to &amp;ldquo;my kind of thing&amp;rdquo; rather than exploring what is new to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran into Annie as I was limping my way toward the church with sore feet. I also noticed that Sam from the Pittsburgh Recorder Society was a guest performer for some of the music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-concert&#34;&gt;The concert&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chatham Baroque was joined by a choir and solo vocalists and conductor to fill out the forces needed to perform the music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was completely wowed by the bass soloist. The depth and expression of his voice was amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the music itself, I&amp;rsquo;ve already confessed that mostly sacred choral music from this time period is not really my thing. I didn&amp;rsquo;t change my mind, although I was glad to have given it a shot. I have enjoyed playing the instrumental music of Henry Purcell for recorder, but this music for the English court didn&amp;rsquo;t do much for me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Another exciting concert at Bar Marco: Chris Norman and the Chatham Baroque playing a tasty assortment of dynamic music</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just this week, Annie of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/PittsburghRecorderSociety&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Recorder Society&lt;/a&gt; sent out email reminding us of upcoming musical performances of interest, including some by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chathambaroque.org/&#34;&gt;Chatham Baroque&lt;/a&gt; joined by visiting &lt;a href=&#34;http://chrisnorman.com/&#34;&gt;Chris Norman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://chrisnorman.com/images/home_feature.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Chris Norman&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When I heard that Chris Norman was coming, I frantically started rethinking my schedule for the week, because I really wanted to see him playing his wooden flutes. He has been one of my primary musical heroes since I first encountered him at a &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/04/21/my-first-time-in-a-public-music-jam-intense-fun-with-chris-norman-and-david-greenberg/&#34;&gt;public music jam session last year&lt;/a&gt; sponsored by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rbsp.org/&#34;&gt;Renaissance and Baroque of Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;. That day was one of the most important days of my life, which I will never forget, because not only did I see and hear a real master, but also was encouraged to participate myself in playing music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always also been a big fan of Chatham Baroque, for their lively, alert performances of the standard repertoire as well as &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/10/04/chatham-baroque-thoughts-on-playing-new-non-baroque-music-on-baroque-instruments/&#34;&gt;new collaborations and projects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I managed to attend one of this week&amp;rsquo;s concerts, and I was not disappointed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-i-rarely-attend-concerts&#34;&gt;Why I rarely attend concerts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, a reminder: nowadays, I rarely attend concerts (or even listen to recorded music). &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/02/i-love-music-but-rarely-listen-to-it-now/&#34;&gt;I explained why over a year ago&lt;/a&gt;: time is limited (on weekdays and particularly on weekends). Furthermore, when I do attend concerts, I am much pickier about what I attend, because when I think about it, in the past I have often been disappointed by concerts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;bar-marco-and-nature-of-music-venues&#34;&gt;Bar Marco and nature of music venues&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I came to realize is that the standard &amp;ldquo;classical music&amp;rdquo; concert is not to my taste. First of all, the programs tend to be very long, such as two hours with an intermission, which, frankly, taxes both my attention span as well as takes up an entire block of time in an evening. Second, and most important actually, is that there is a sense of &amp;ldquo;distance&amp;rdquo; and even formality in the standard concert. This is reinforced by certain choices of clothing and demeanor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: I&amp;rsquo;m speaking as one who did not grow up in &amp;ldquo;classical music&amp;rdquo; culture, but only really discovered and fell in love with Western art music upon &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/12/10/rip-charles-rosen/&#34;&gt;attending college&lt;/a&gt;. So there have always been things about the culture that initially struck me as strange, and are probably at least partially responsible for the relative lack of popularity of the music among younger people (just peek into the average classical music concert hall and you&amp;rsquo;ll see geezers and middle-aged people).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rather enjoyed the use of Bar Marco last fall as non-traditional music venue, where &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/11/14/classical-revolution-pittsburghs-aquitango-delivers-passionate-traditional-tango/&#34;&gt;I saw AquiTango performing, and sat up close&lt;/a&gt; and enjoyed the relative intimacy and informality of the occasion. Not only that, but from a technical, performance point of view (now that I play music myself), it is extremely educational for me to be up front seeing what the musicians do and relating to it and learning from it, whether it&amp;rsquo;s cues and signals among them or details of physical technique. This is stuff you can&amp;rsquo;t get sitting far away in a big concert hall, and you certainly can&amp;rsquo;t get at all from audio recordings or even videos really. You have to be there, anticipating, thinking actively, hearing the breaths, seeing the faces, in real time. Music is not just sound, not just wave forms or digital bits. It&amp;rsquo;s a live, active creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I jumped at the opportunity to see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.showclix.com/event/3745641&#34;&gt;Chris Norman and Chatham Baroque also at Bar Marco&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This venue has its limitations, of course. Primarily, the bar downstairs is very noisy, and it would be nice if there were a barrier to avoid the noise and music blasting downstairs from so easily being heard upstairs. That said, for the most part I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too bothered by the noise, because I sat up front very near the musicians, and so when they were playing, I didn&amp;rsquo;t hear the noise. But in moments of dead silence the distraction was real. I would suggest putting up a temporary barrier at the stairway during performances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-music&#34;&gt;The music&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A single hour of musical selections was presented (a good length for me; as I mentioned earlier, two hours is a very long time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;scottish-baroque-james-osvald&#34;&gt;Scottish Baroque: James Osvald&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concert started out with a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Baroque_music&#34;&gt;Scottish Baroque&lt;/a&gt; sonata by &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Oswald_%28composer%29&#34;&gt;James Osvald&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was interested to actually see Scottish Baroque music being performed live because up till now, I had only &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/09/08/finally-performing-some-sonatas-for-baroque-flute/&#34;&gt;played it without listening to it, through a &amp;ldquo;Baroque Around the World&amp;rdquo; series of books&lt;/a&gt;. And I had played it on flute, even though the music was clearly geared toward violin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;instruments&#34;&gt;Instruments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris played the same keyed wooden &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oldflutes.com/classical.htm&#34;&gt;classical flute&lt;/a&gt; for the most part through the concert, although in the slow movement of just this sonata he switched to a deeper alto flute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the concert, Andrew Fouts played Baroque violin, while Patrician Halverson played different sizes of viola da gamba, and Scott Pauley played theorbo as well as a banjo and a Baroque guitar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;no-program-notes&#34;&gt;No program notes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were no program notes for this concert, by the way: &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/11/11/on-not-reading-concert-program-notes/&#34;&gt;just how I like it&lt;/a&gt;! Instead, Chris introduced each piece before he and Chatham Baroque performed it. I liked how he added colorful and humorous touches to his brief introductions. &lt;em&gt;All concerts should work this way&lt;/em&gt;. Long program notes are as pointless, in my opinion, as voluminous printed slides at a lecture: they are only a distraction from the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;american-old-time-music&#34;&gt;American old-time music&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then they switched things up and played some American &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old-time_music&#34;&gt;old-time music&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_of_Constant_Sorrow&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Man of Constant Sorrow&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. It was interesting hearing Baroque instruments used for this kind of music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris was really in his element playing this folk music. He became very expressive and walked around and stamped his feet. You can&amp;rsquo;t experience this kind of concentration and passion just sitting at home listening to some CD or music file: you had to be there, up front! This is what I want to live when I attend a concert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;back-to-scottish-baroque-william-mcgibbon&#34;&gt;Back to Scottish Baroque: William McGibbon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another name familiar to me (because of having played on flute one of his sonatas) came up, the Scottish Baroque composer &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_McGibbon&#34;&gt;William McGibbon&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently the composer was inspired by the Italian style and incorporated into his piece, a sonata in the style of Corelli. I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to remember that even back in the 18th century, musicians were eager to learn from their counterparts in remote places in the world. Think of how much effort it took to visit or get word of what was going on in Italy, from Scotland!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;maritime-canada&#34;&gt;Maritime Canada&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we entered the world of Chris&amp;rsquo;s own heritage: he is from &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_the_Maritimes&#34;&gt;Maritime Canada&lt;/a&gt;. He did some singing in French as well as flute playing. It was the first time I had ever heard him sing, and it sounded similar to Cajun singing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;back-to-osvald&#34;&gt;Back to Osvald&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we returned to Osvald, for the &amp;ldquo;Hawthorn&amp;rdquo; sonata. I was very curious to hear this because I had never heard it played, but had &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/09/08/finally-performing-some-sonatas-for-baroque-flute/&#34;&gt;played it myself on Baroque flute with Henry on piano&lt;/a&gt;, and run into problems because it was clearly meant for violin, given the crazy fast jig movement at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that Chris took a break and sat out most of this sonata, ha! I enjoyed the opportunity to observe how Andrew on Baroque violin would play the first movement, to compare his style and choice of ornamentations with what I&amp;rsquo;ve done myself. He played it rather differently than how I play it. This is one of the fascinating things I like about Baroque music: there is a good deal of personal choice in how we feel and interpret it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my amusement, Chris did come in for the brief but crazy fast jig that was the third movement, showing off his triple-tonguing chops on flute. Whew!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;scottish-smallpipes&#34;&gt;Scottish smallpipes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended with Chris pulling out his &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_smallpipes&#34;&gt;Scottish smallpipes&lt;/a&gt; and playing on them. I had never seen this instrument before and was fascinated. In contrast to mouth-blown bagpipes, these are played with the arms only. A vigorous conclusion to the concert!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;afterwards&#34;&gt;Afterwards&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chatted with Chris Norman a little afterwards. He seemed to recognize me from the jam session a year ago; that surprised me since I was just some quiet guy in the crowd who was still quite a beginner and didn&amp;rsquo;t play all that much. Anyway, I told him I was inspired by that jam session to not only play more traditional music of the kind that he plays (I got into Irish and French, buying myself an &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/irish-flute/&#34;&gt;Irish flute&lt;/a&gt;), but also improving my technique considerably on &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/baroque-flute/&#34;&gt;Baroque flute&lt;/a&gt;. I asked him about his new work on making wooden flutes; I thought it was really cool that he not only plays them, but now makes them too, and why not, if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in the engineering aspects of creating the kind of sounds you want? This utter physicality of (non-digital) music is something that I&amp;rsquo;ve come to particularly appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a really great time at the concert at Bar Marco by Chris Norman and Chatham Baroque. I left inspired again to continue my own music-making and improve on it and incorporate my own personality into it, the way these fine musicians do. It was an hour well-spent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Chatham Baroque: thoughts on playing new non-Baroque music on Baroque instruments</title>

    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Chatham Baroque press photo&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Today I went to the weekly CMU music convocation, which featured the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chathambaroque.org/&#34;&gt;Chatham Baroque&lt;/a&gt;. They provided some interesting discussions and performances of musical excerpts of newly commissioned works as a preview before their &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chathambaroque.org/events/baroque-reframed&#34;&gt;official premiere tomorrow&lt;/a&gt; in Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be thinking, &amp;ldquo;Wait a second, &lt;em&gt;newly commissioned works&lt;/em&gt; for a Baroque ensemble playing Baroque instruments?&amp;rdquo; Does this mean some derivative, neo-Baroque stuff?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-would-one-want-to-play-newly-composed-music-on-old-instruments&#34;&gt;Why would one want to play newly composed music on old instruments?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Superficially, one might wonder about the point of playing newly composed music on old instruments. But then one realizes that every instrument is an &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; instrument. The &amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo; piano as we know it has been around for well over a century; it is an &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; instrument! By now, even the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_guitar&#34;&gt;electric guitar&lt;/a&gt; is 81 years old. It&amp;rsquo;s an ancient instrument. Nobody thinks twice about writing new music for or playing music for the electric guitar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each instrument, no matter how old or new it is, presents unique sonorities and possibilities and technical challenges. There&amp;rsquo;s no reason not to explore new ways of exploiting and appreciating Baroque instruments in the service of fascinating new music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;three-composers&#34;&gt;Three composers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three composers whose works we got a preview of were Moon Young Ha, Matthew McBane, and Lansing McLoskey. Each of them gave a brief introduction and talked about why they decided to write for the Chatham Baroque ensemble of violin, viola da gamba, and theorbo, and what they tried to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the Andrew, Patricia, and Scott perform excerpts of the composers&amp;rsquo; pieces. None of them were imitative neo-Baroque pieces and they were intriguing, each in a completely different way, different harmonic and rhythmic languages and emphases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s great that Chatham Baroque is expanding beyond the Baroque in their musical explorations. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chathambaroque.org/events&#34;&gt;Coming up in their concert season&lt;/a&gt;, they will be performing with some traditional Appalachian vocalists and instrumentalists. That should be interesting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;one-limitation&#34;&gt;One limitation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While enjoying the previews of the new pieces, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help thinking back to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://pittsburghmusicalliance.org/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Music Alliance&lt;/a&gt; season launch party that Abby and I &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/09/20/my-first-bobblehead-doll-guess-who/&#34;&gt;attended recently&lt;/a&gt;. There, Chatham Baroque performed some music, but we could barely hear any of the instruments. At best, I could hear a bit of Andrew on Baroque violin, while the viola da gamba and theorbo were rather drowned out by the party noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think a real limitation of the Baroque instruments is that they are relatively quiet and subtle. I found this a problem myself when trying to play Baroque flute in &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/09/28/another-french-music-jam-also-announcing-cats-dance/&#34;&gt;casual musical jam or party performance situations&lt;/a&gt;. In a quiet and intimate space, they work beautifully. But in a noisy, crowded world, they do not. That is my impression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because you play a Baroque instrument doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you have to be stuck only playing Baroque music or neo-Baroque music. The world is wide open, constrained only by taste and acoustic realities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I now own my first &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobblehead&#34;&gt;bobblehead doll&lt;/a&gt;! Abby was reluctant to let me take him home, but I argued that he would inspire me in the playing of his music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As we wandered around at the party, we sampled the food and checked out the tables of the five organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(There are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.472125112808231.106189.197956923558386&amp;amp;type=3&#34;&gt;photos of the party here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We arrived in time to see my &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/recorder/&#34;&gt;recorder&lt;/a&gt; friends perform as a recorder quartet, playing a variety of selections. Fred, Helen, Mike, and Annie were delightful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, members of the five music organizations took turns performing for us. Unfortunately, the acoustic situation was quite poor amidst the party conversations going on everywhere, but I enjoyed watching the people who sang and played for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-bobbleheads&#34;&gt;The bobbleheads&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw approximately ten bobbleheads, each in its unopened box, sitting around. I got very excited. It turned out that they were being given away. I secretly always wanted one since seeing my friend Henry with one on top of his piano; he had one of Beethoven:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/beethoven-bobblehead.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Beethoven bobblehead&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;By the bobbleheads, there was a sheet saying something like, &amp;ldquo;Name a piece I wrote and you can take me home.&amp;rdquo; It seemed that nobody was really enforcing this, but when I offered to take one, I said the bobblehead would help me as I worked on the composer&amp;rsquo;s [flute sonatas]().&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes-on-johann-sebastian-bach-s-flute-sonatas&#34;&gt;Notes on Johann Sebastian Bach&amp;rsquo;s flute sonatas&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The composer whose bobblehead I got was, of course, &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/johann-sebastian-bach/&#34;&gt;Johann Sebastian Bach&lt;/a&gt;, a hero of mine in the past year during which I&amp;rsquo;ve gradually fallen in love with Baroque music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-instrument&#34;&gt;What instrument?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am faced with a conundrum when trying to play Bach&amp;rsquo;s flute sonatas: &lt;em&gt;what instrument should I use to play this music?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of his son, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Philipp_Emanuel_Bach&#34;&gt;CPE Bach&lt;/a&gt;, two months ago in a recital &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/07/28/my-first-appearance-on-a-music-recital-program/&#34;&gt;I played a movement of CPE Bach&amp;rsquo;s solo flute sonata&lt;/a&gt; using a modern flute. I feel that the nature of CPE Bach&amp;rsquo;s music, more dramatic and agitated, makes the modern flute a reasonable instrument for the piece; I feel that it is definitely reasonable to play the music on a Baroque flute instead, but that I actually prefer it on modern flute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plus, CPE Bach&amp;rsquo;s music is much easier to play on modern flute.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Johann Sebastian Bach&amp;rsquo;s flute sonatas, although I prefer them on Baroque flute than to modern flute, are much harder to play on Baroque flute. It turns out that I dislike almost all recordings I&amp;rsquo;ve come across of this music on modern flute, with one exception: the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pahudbach.com/&#34;&gt;recordings&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/emmanuel-pahud/&#34;&gt;Emmanuel Pahud&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-decision&#34;&gt;My decision&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve made an unpleasant decision. I work on the slow, easy movements of the flute sonatas on Baroque flute, and I don&amp;rsquo;t currently work on the harder movements at all. I&amp;rsquo;m still far worse on Baroque flute than on modern flute, and those fast movements are beyond me on Baroque flute. And I don&amp;rsquo;t really want to play the music on modern flute. This is just my personal choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a great time at the Pittsburgh Music Alliance season launch party. It was inspiring to see my recorder friends playing, and to see others in the early music community performing with enthusiasm. (Seeing people singing as an ensemble even got me thinking about getting into that sometime maybe.) If you enjoy fresh, vital performances of early music, check out the five organizations mentioned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I&amp;rsquo;m grateful to now be the proud owner of a Johann Sebastian Bach bobblehead doll. Every time I see him, I remember that I must play his music with verve and soul, because he&amp;rsquo;s watching.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
