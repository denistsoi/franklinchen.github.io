      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m always frustrated at this time of year because there are so many events of interest to me in Pittsburgh that seem to happen on the first weekend of October. Since I cannot attend all of them, I figured I might as well attempt a public service and mention some of them so that if you are in the Pittsburgh area, maybe you can go and enjoy what I can&amp;rsquo;t attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here are 9 of the probably dozens of cool things you could be doing tomorrow, Saturday, October 5, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;free-concert-allegheny-city-ragtime-orchestra&#34;&gt;Free concert: Allegheny City Ragtime Orchestra&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in ragtime or Latin music, check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shadysideacademy.org/page.cfm?p=12541&#34;&gt;this concert by the Allegheny City Ragtime Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some articles in anticipation of it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/ae/music/preview-ragtime-orchestra-connects-with-history-705929/&#34;&gt;Post-Gazette&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://triblive.com/aande/music/4763900-74/ragtime-music-concert&#34;&gt;Trib&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby and I wanted to go, but finally decided that we have too many other activities earlier in the day and need to just stay home and unwind in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;free-conference-podcamp-pittsburgh-8&#34;&gt;Free conference: PodCamp Pittsburgh 8&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 8th annual &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.podcamppittsburgh.com/&#34;&gt;PodCamp Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt; should be good. If you have any interest in using social media for personal or professional purposes, you should check it out. Interesting talks, opportunities to just socialized and learn new things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I attended in 2010, 2011, 2012, and will attend again for the fourth year. Unfortunately, I will only be able to attend the afternoon sessions. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to completely miss it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that PodCamp completely changed my life. For example, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/21/one-month-anniversary-of-my-blog/&#34;&gt;I started this blog in 2011 because of my second PodCamp&lt;/a&gt;, and I became serious about using social media in general, and that led to a total transformation of my life as I learned about local activities and made new friends. (Unfortunately, I didn&amp;rsquo;t get around to finishing my draft reports about my experience at last year&amp;rsquo;s PodCamp 7.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;pittsburgh-south-side-slopes-step-trek&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh South Side Slopes Step Trek&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The annual &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.southsideslopes.org/steptrek/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh South Side Slopes Step Trek&lt;/a&gt; is another event you can attend tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out my &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/08/my-god-its-full-of-stairs-pittsburgh-step-trek-2011/&#34;&gt;blog coverage two years ago&lt;/a&gt; as well as my &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/09/25/why-you-should-go-out-to-the-pittsburgh-south-side-slopes-step-trek/&#34;&gt;recent update&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Abby and I will be missing it this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;run-shadyside-5k&#34;&gt;Run Shadyside 5K&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like to run in races, a fine race is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.runshadyside.com/&#34;&gt;Run Shadyside 5K&lt;/a&gt;. Fast and flat, with a pancake breakfast and festivities afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not running in it this year, just because I have too many other things to do already for the rest of the day, but here&amp;rsquo;s my &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/01/run-shadyside-5k-outrunning-mickey-mouse-and-lending-a-trumpet/&#34;&gt;report from two years ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;free-5th-annual-wilkins-school-community-center-ecofest-in-regent-square&#34;&gt;Free: 5th annual Wilkins School Community Center Ecofest in Regent Square&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Interested in green living? Check out the &lt;a href=&#34;http://foresthills-regentsquare.patch.com/groups/around-town/p/ecofest-encourages-recycling-green-living&#34;&gt;5th annual Wilkins School Community Center Ecofest in Regent Square&lt;/a&gt;. Abby has regularly attended for the clothing swap. There will also be food, information, and entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that this year, I will also be attending, to perform as a new member of the Steel City Ukuleles. &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/08/23/another-unexpected-life-change-one-month-of-learning-to-play-ukulele/&#34;&gt;I just started playing the ukulele a bit over two months ago&lt;/a&gt;, and have been working hard to help put on an entertaining show!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll be performing around 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM. If you come, say hello!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cmu-donut-dash-2-mile-race&#34;&gt;CMU Donut Dash 2 mile race&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, if you are into weird running events, there is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://cmudonutdash.org/&#34;&gt;Carnegie Mellon University Donut Dash&lt;/a&gt;, a 2 mile event serving as a fundraiser for the Children&amp;rsquo;s Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC. This is not an event I have ever done, and not one I intend to do, but what the heck, some of you might love this sort of thing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;national-chess-day-gateway-open-tournament-at-the-pittsburgh-chess-club&#34;&gt;National Chess Day: Gateway Open tournament at the Pittsburgh Chess Club&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that it&amp;rsquo;s time for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nationalchessday.com/&#34;&gt;National Chess Day&lt;/a&gt;? There will be a tournament at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://pittsburghcc.org/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Chess Club&lt;/a&gt;, the 56th annual Gateway Open. Yes, chess in Pittsburgh has a long and illustrious history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;pittsburgh-perl-workshop&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Perl Workshop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a Perl programmer, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://pghpw.org/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Perl Workshop&lt;/a&gt; is back &lt;a href=&#34;http://pghpw.org/ppw2013/&#34;&gt;this year&lt;/a&gt;. Registration is already closed, so it&amp;rsquo;s not so helpful right now for me to mention it, but in case you didn&amp;rsquo;t know it existed, watch for it next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ninth-thing&#34;&gt;Ninth thing?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, I guess I miscounted. But there are a whole lot more than nine things to do in Pittsburgh tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you are interested in some free stuff to do, there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.radworkshere.org/interior.php?pageID=64&#34;&gt;RADical Days&lt;/a&gt; listing a whole bunch of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no shortage of stuff to do in this great city of Pittsburgh at any time or day of year. I think it&amp;rsquo;s unfortunate that many things I like to do happen to repeatedly fall on the first Saturday of the year, but I&amp;rsquo;m not complaining about an embarrassment of riches. Go out and take advantage of what I can&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pittsburgh Python: distribute and other Python community controversies</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/02/27/pittsburgh-python-distribute-and-other-python-community-controversies/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Feb 2013 22:12:03 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/02/27/pittsburgh-python-distribute-and-other-python-community-controversies/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was very interested to attend this month&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/pghpython/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Python User Group&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/pghpython/events/95504432/&#34;&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt; because Nick Sloan was going to give a talk about packaging with &lt;a href=&#34;http://pythonhosted.org/distribute/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;distribute&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: packaging in Python has been a &lt;em&gt;huge source of confusion&lt;/em&gt; to me, both as a user and as a developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my use of Python at work or for personal purposes has not been very large scale, I have limped along with settling on a clean setup to use for packaging my code. This is in stark contrast to my management of libraries in Perl, Ruby, and Java, where I think there has been more of a consensus in adoption of certain tools and conventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, Joe Esposito sent around some links to interesting discussions and news in the global Python community, so I looked forward to hearing what everyone thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem-with-python-packaging&#34;&gt;The problem with Python packaging&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, so the big problem I faced when trying to nicely set up packaging for a personal project a while ago was that there are many options. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice:_Why_More_Is_Less&#34;&gt;paradox of choice&lt;/a&gt; is insidious, and it is surprising to me in the Python community, which has generally prided itself on a general consensus on a philosophy of &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.python.org/moin/TOOWTDI&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s Only One Way To Do It&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, in sharp and deliberate contrast to the Perl community&amp;rsquo;s philosophy of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There&#39;s_more_than_one_way_to_do_it&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s More Than One Way To Do It&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; (TIMTOWTDI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;nick-sloan-on-packaging-with-distribute-http-pythonhosted-org-distribute&#34;&gt;Nick Sloan on packaging with &lt;a href=&#34;http://pythonhosted.org/distribute/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;distribute&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick summarized the situation of existing packaging systems for Python:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.python.org/2/distutils/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;distutils&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is lacking in features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/index.html&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;setuptools&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is stagnant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pythonhosted.org/distribute/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;distribute&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a fork of &lt;code&gt;setuptools&lt;/code&gt; and aims to replace it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then illustrated the basics of packaging with writing &lt;code&gt;setup.py&lt;/code&gt;, referencing &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/kr-projects/b8388ba7c1a&#34;&gt;Kenneth Reitz&amp;rsquo;s recommendations on repository structure&lt;/a&gt;, based on &lt;code&gt;distribute&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;kenneth-reitz-s-recommendations-on-repository-structure&#34;&gt;Kenneth Reitz&amp;rsquo;s recommendations on repository structure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most interesting thing about Kenneth Reitz&amp;rsquo;s recommendations was that he advocated separating out &lt;em&gt;tests&lt;/em&gt; from the code of a module, to reduce dependencies for the installer and user of the module. I definitely prefer to have a separate directory tree for tests, as is standard by &lt;em&gt;convention&lt;/em&gt; when I write tests for projects in many other languages. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perl: &lt;code&gt;t/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ruby: &lt;code&gt;spec/&lt;/code&gt; when using RSpec&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Java: &lt;code&gt;src/test/&lt;/code&gt; when using JUnit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scala: &lt;code&gt;src/test/&lt;/code&gt; when using Specs2 and ScalaCheck&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t really like his &lt;code&gt;tests/context.py&lt;/code&gt; system of imports, as it is too dynamic in chasing down imports, and therefore may not play well by default with standard tools:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34; style=&#34;background: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;line-height: 125%&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #008000; font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #008000; font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;
sys&lt;span style=&#34;color: #666666&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;path&lt;span style=&#34;color: #666666&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;insert(&lt;span style=&#34;color: #666666&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;, os&lt;span style=&#34;color: #666666&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;path&lt;span style=&#34;color: #666666&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;abspath(&lt;span style=&#34;border: 1px solid #FF0000&#34;&gt;‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #666666&#34;&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;border: 1px solid #FF0000&#34;&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;))

&lt;span style=&#34;color: #008000; font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;sample&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34; style=&#34;background: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;line-height: 125%&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #008000; font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;.context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #008000; font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; sample
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That said, I decided to give his recommendations a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;another-twist&#34;&gt;Another twist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Nick noted that there is also a &lt;a href=&#34;http://pythonhosted.org/Distutils2/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;distutils2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; project now, to improve &lt;code&gt;distutils&lt;/code&gt;, and that nobody is working on &lt;code&gt;distribute&lt;/code&gt; any more. This sounds like a crazy soap opera in the Python world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;python-community-debates-and-news&#34;&gt;Python community debates and news&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe opened up the discussion on Python community news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;start-writing-more-classes&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Start Writing More Classes&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Python community, there has always been some controversy over whether to go all-out object-oriented with classes or write in a more functional style. The language supports both styles, although classes were a fairly late addition to the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;stop-writing-classes&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Stop Writing Classes&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, at PyCon 2012, there was a talk, &amp;ldquo;Stop Writing Classes&amp;rdquo;, that made waves:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/o9pEzgHorH0&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought it was a good talk, because it exposed how many things done with classes are superfluous, creating code bloat and deeply nested hierarchies: often you can just use a functional style with data that is not all wrapped into classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-rebuttal&#34;&gt;A rebuttal&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just two weeks ago, someone wrote a post on how &lt;a href=&#34;http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2013/2/13/moar-classes/&#34;&gt;Python programmers should be writing more classes, not less&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was not happy about this post because it set up a straw man. Really, he was simply arguing for modular code vs. monolithic code, and observing that some people who don&amp;rsquo;t use classes end up writing monolithic code. He even states as much at the end of his post. So the title of his post is misleading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-news&#34;&gt;Other news&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were various other smaller topics discussed, but &lt;code&gt;distribute&lt;/code&gt; and classes dominated this evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;updates-after-the-meetup&#34;&gt;(Updates after the meetup)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I went home, I updated &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/FranklinChen/project-euler-python&#34;&gt;one of my sample Python projects&lt;/a&gt; to adhere to Kenneth Reitz&amp;rsquo;s guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, some weeks later, I noticed an &lt;a href=&#34;http://mail.python.org/pipermail/distutils-sig/2013-March/020126.html&#34;&gt;announcement that &lt;code&gt;setuptools&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;distribute&lt;/code&gt; were going to merge efforts&lt;/a&gt;. Hooray!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        &lt;h4&gt;Justice Clarence Thomas&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Thomas&#34;&gt;Justice Clarence Thomas&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.supremecourt.gov/&#34;&gt;Supreme Court of the United States&lt;/a&gt; uncovered a seven-year-old bug in a computer program I wrote years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what happened:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;oral-arguments-of-scotus-http-www-supremecourt-gov-oral-arguments-oral-arguments-aspx&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/oral_arguments.aspx&#34;&gt;Oral arguments of SCOTUS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, as part of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://talkbank.org/&#34;&gt;TalkBank&lt;/a&gt; project, I wrote a suite of computer programs to clean up, correct, and transform &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts.aspx&#34;&gt;SCOTUS oral argument transcripts&lt;/a&gt; into a particular text file format called &lt;a href=&#34;http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/&#34;&gt;CHAT&lt;/a&gt;, to enable analysis and further transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CHAT transcripts are aligned (by humans), utterance by utterance, with the available audio files, in order to create a nice way to simultaneously read the text while listening, with the ability to pause, skip to a particular section, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;example-hamdan-v-rumsfeld-http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-hamdan-v-rumsfeld&#34;&gt;Example: &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamdan_v._Rumsfeld&#34;&gt;Hamdan v. Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;text-formats&#34;&gt;Text formats&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SCOTUS provides an oral transcript in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/05-184.pdf&#34;&gt;PDF format&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At CMU we have made the &lt;a href=&#34;http://talkbank.org/data-orig/Meeting/SCOTUS/2005/05-184.cha&#34;&gt;CHAT-formatted text&lt;/a&gt; of each transcript available, as well as ZIP archives of &lt;a href=&#34;http://talkbank.org/data/Meeting/SCOTUS/2005.zip&#34;&gt;entire corpora&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://talkbank.org/data-xml/Meeting/SCOTUS/2005.zip&#34;&gt;equivalent XML&lt;/a&gt; converted automatically from CHAT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;media-playback&#34;&gt;Media playback&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The linked transcripts can be played back in several ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Directly from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://talkbank.org/browser/index.php?url=Meeting/SCOTUS/2005/05-184.cha&#34;&gt;CMU site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Downloading the &lt;a href=&#34;http://talkbank.org/data/Meeting/SCOTUS/2005.zip&#34;&gt;2005 corpus&lt;/a&gt; and running the &lt;a href=&#34;http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/clan/&#34;&gt;CLAN&lt;/a&gt; desktop application on a transcript.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oyez.org/&#34;&gt;Oyez&lt;/a&gt; provides their own interface, through transformation of the CHAT files, to an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2005/2005_05_184&#34;&gt;entire site for each case&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-happened-today&#34;&gt;What happened today&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, as I have done on Thursdays or Fridays for years now when SCOTUS is in session, I have converted the oral argument transcripts for this week in order to hand off to the Oyez people for their use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-conversion-software&#34;&gt;The conversion software&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversion happens in three steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;pre-processing&#34;&gt;Pre-processing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversion is not fully automatic, because there are always errors of some kind in the transcripts that I correct manually. I wrote a set of twenty-nine separate &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.perl.org/&#34;&gt;Perl&lt;/a&gt; scripts that do a lot of cleanup and checking of transcripts as a pre-processing step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;parsing-validation-transformation&#34;&gt;Parsing, validation, transformation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main task of parsing and validation and transformation uses a program written in Java and using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://antlr.org/&#34;&gt;ANTLR&lt;/a&gt; parser generator framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: these programs were written several years ago, hence the use of ANTLR version 2 rather than ANTLR 3. Newer projects of mine have used ANTLR 3 (&lt;a href=&#34;http://antlr4.org/&#34;&gt;ANTLR 4&lt;/a&gt; is only now about to hit 4.0).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;post-processing&#34;&gt;Post-processing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A post-processing Perl script is used after the initial CHAT generation, in order to convert numerical and other tokens into the desired spoken form; at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://pghpw.org/ppw2010/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Perl Workshop 2010&lt;/a&gt;, I gave a little talk, &lt;a href=&#34;http://pghpw.org/ppw2010/talk/3029&#34;&gt;How do you pronounce &amp;ldquo;07-1191&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/a&gt;, about this part of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;reliable-legacy-software&#34;&gt;Reliable legacy software&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No new development has been done on these programs for several years, since as far as can be determined, there have been no remaining bugs in the programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These programs have, to date, successfully generated 3,468 CHAT files that have been validated. In the first year or two, there were bugs quickly found and fixed, and then I don&amp;rsquo;t remember the last time a bug was found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Until today&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-bug&#34;&gt;The bug&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bug came today as I was processing this week&amp;rsquo;s case &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-9953.pdf&#34;&gt;11-9953&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got an error message when my pre-processing phase exited after an error while running the script &lt;code&gt;find-bad-ids.pl&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34; style=&#34;background: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;line-height: 125%&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #888888&#34;&gt;THOMAS not found&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I was confused. I looked at the transcript and saw:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
JUSTICE SCALIA: And another of his counsel, Mr. Singer -- of the three that he had -- he was a graduate of Harvard law school, wasn&#39;t he?

MS. SIGLER: Yes, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Son of a gun.

JUSTICE THOMAS: Well -- he did not --

(Laughter.)

MS. SIGLER: I would refute that, Justice Thomas.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, do you want to define constitutionally adequate counsel? Is it anybody who&#39;s graduated from Harvard and Yale?

(Laughter.)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was confused about why my script would not recognized Justice Thomas. I looked at the Perl source code, saw where I initialized a table of Justice names, and saw:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34; style=&#34;background: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;line-height: 125%&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #008000; font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;String::Approx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #BA2121&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;amatch&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;

&lt;span style=&#34;color: #19177C&#34;&gt;$lastNames&lt;/span&gt;{REHNQUIST} &lt;span style=&#34;color: #666666&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #666666&#34;&gt;-1&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #19177C&#34;&gt;$lastNames&lt;/span&gt;{STEVENS} &lt;span style=&#34;color: #666666&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #666666&#34;&gt;-1&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #408080; font-style: italic&#34;&gt;# ... code omitted&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span style=&#34;color: #008000; font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color: #AA22FF; font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #008000&#34;&gt;exists&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #19177C&#34;&gt;$lastNames&lt;/span&gt;{&lt;span style=&#34;color: #19177C&#34;&gt;$upperLastName&lt;/span&gt;}) {
      &lt;span style=&#34;color: #008000; font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color: #008000; font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #19177C&#34;&gt;@matches&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #666666&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; amatch(&lt;span style=&#34;color: #19177C&#34;&gt;$upperLastName&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color: #19177C&#34;&gt;@ids&lt;/span&gt;)) {
        &lt;span style=&#34;color: #008000&#34;&gt;warn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #BA2121&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;$path:$.: $lastName: guessing to be $matches[0]\n&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;;
      }
      &lt;span style=&#34;color: #008000; font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; {
        &lt;span style=&#34;color: #008000&#34;&gt;warn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #BA2121&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;$path:$.: $lastName not found\n&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;;
      }
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I had simply forgotten seven years ago to put into the table initialization the following code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34; style=&#34;background: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;line-height: 125%&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #19177C&#34;&gt;$lastNames&lt;/span&gt;{THOMAS} &lt;span style=&#34;color: #666666&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #666666&#34;&gt;-1&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And this bug had lain undiscovered for seven years because &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/clarence-thomas-breaks-long-silence-during-supreme-court-oral-arguments/2013/01/14/a7c6023c-5e7a-11e2-9940-6fc488f3fecd_story.html&#34;&gt;Justice Thomas has not spoken in seven years&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-the-bug-arose&#34;&gt;How the bug arose&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Justice Thomas did speak in the following transcripts I successfully converted years ago:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1999&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;99&lt;/sub&gt;-478&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2000&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;99&lt;/sub&gt;-1848&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2000&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;99&lt;/sub&gt;-1964&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2001&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;00&lt;/sub&gt;-1770&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2001&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt;-631&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2002&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt;-1107&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2002&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;02&lt;/sub&gt;-516&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2004&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;03&lt;/sub&gt;-1164&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2005&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;04&lt;/sub&gt;-1067&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2005&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;04&lt;/sub&gt;-1327&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2005&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;04&lt;/sub&gt;-52&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happened was that they were generated before I wrote the &lt;code&gt;find-bad-ids.pl&lt;/code&gt; script. The main program in Java has its own table of justices. The purpose of the pre-processing Perl script is to catch errors earlier than handing off to the Java program. In particular, the use of approximate string matching enables easy correction of typos before ANTLR ever sees the text to parse. Before the pre-processing scripts, the text that arrived at ANTLR often had a lot of systematic errors that were annoying to fix, so I wrote in Perl both a cleanup pre-processing phase and a checking pre-processing phase. They include tests for all kinds of &amp;ldquo;suspicious&amp;rdquo; formatting and tokens and ambiguity that require manual judgment and correction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still don&amp;rsquo;t know why I forgot to put Justice Thomas into the table initialization code in my Perl script seven years ago, but it resulted in a bug that was not detected until today. The lesson: your computer program can have bugs if you didn&amp;rsquo;t get test data that represented all possible situations, including that of Justice Thomas actually speaking during a SCOTUS oral argument!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/04/13/free-course-review-software-engineering-for-software-as-a-service-part-i-from-coursera/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So after putting quite a bit of time, from February 20 to March 23, into the free Coursera course &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.saas-class.org/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Software Engineering for Software as a Service (Part I)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, I just received my &amp;ldquo;Statement of Accomplishment&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Congratulations! You have successfully completed the free online offering of Software Engineering for Software as a Service (Part I), offered February to April, 2012. To successfully complete this free online class, students were required to watch lectures, complete quizzes, and do weekly assignments.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My review:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;mooc-explosion&#34;&gt;MOOC explosion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just half a year ago, in the fall of 2011, my life was &lt;em&gt;radically altered&lt;/em&gt; by the introduction of free massive open online courses (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course&#34;&gt;MOOCs&lt;/a&gt;). Eager to learn new skills and ideas of all kinds, I jumped into enrolling in a whole bunch of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went crazy, actually: I took a very heavy load, enrolling in and completing two Stanford MOOCs while doing everything else I was doing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/01/11/experiment-in-learning-completing-stanford-online-course-introduction-to-databases/&#34;&gt;Introduction to Databases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/01/12/experiment-in-learning-completing-stanford-online-course-machine-learning/&#34;&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two courses each lasted for two months, starting in early October and ending in mid-December of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This spring of 2012, I went crazy again and took a very heavy load of two MOOCs, through Coursera:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software Engineering for Software as a Service (Part I) (discussed here)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model Thinking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-on-model-thinking&#34;&gt;(Update on Model Thinking)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/06/16/review-of-coursera-course-model-thinking/&#34;&gt;An incomplete review of Model Thinking.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-did-i-take-this-course&#34;&gt;Why did I take this course?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I signed up for this course in February because I was curious about &lt;a href=&#34;http://rubyonrails.org/&#34;&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt;. I have not done much Web development since the old days of Perl, so I decided to update my skills in this area, which is not what I do in my current job. Also, although I have used some Ruby at my job, I felt that the course would help me deepen my understanding of the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, this course was advertised as not being about Rails so much as about &amp;ldquo;software engineering&amp;rdquo; using the concept of &amp;ldquo;software as a service&amp;rdquo; as a concrete domain. So I was interested in getting my hands dirty in adopting the instructors&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;opinionated&amp;rdquo; idea of an &amp;ldquo;Agile&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;software engineering&amp;rdquo; process for development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;materials&#34;&gt;Materials&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lectures on video were provided. I found them useful but fairly poor in production qualities (sound problems and quite a few in-video quiz glitches). I understand that the instructors may improve these materials, for future offerings of the course, after the scramble of getting everything together for the first trial run of this course!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhat controversially, the instructors&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href=&#34;http://beta.saasbook.info/&#34;&gt;textbook that was still in rough alpha condition&lt;/a&gt; was recommended for the course. Originally I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to buy it, but I found references from the course that made it sound like it would be useful, so I bought it. It was rather poorly formatted and repeated a lot that was already in the lecture videos and slides, but did have additional material. The book was inexpensive enough that its flaws did not annoy me excessively. (Eventually the book finally entered beta!)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://sites.google.com/site/longlastingsoftware/_/rsrc/1366223530547/config/cover.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Book cover&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Confusingly, we were also to watch the &lt;a href=&#34;http://screencast.saasbook.info/&#34;&gt;videos for the book&lt;/a&gt;. Having course material spread out like this was annoying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were told that the course was going to cover about half of the book, and that there might be a second online course offered at some point, to finish the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;coursework&#34;&gt;Coursework&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were quizzes. I experienced glitches in dealing with them. For example, in one of the quizzes, the timer ran down because I started it but then had to attend to something (I was at home in the evening then). When I went back, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t retake the quiz, so I got no credit for anything! It was upsetting, but then again, my goal was to learn, not to get a perfect score in this class. Also, sometimes when I got an answer wrong on a quiz, there was no feedback about what I did wrong! This was quite annoying. The quiz system needs to be significantly improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programming assignments were the heart of the course. They sometimes took quite a long time to complete. There were several reasons for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One was just that Rails is big, and in learning to actually write and deploy Rails applications, I had to get familiar with the online documentation to search for Rails methods to use. Another was the use of Cucumber. It took forever to run Cucumber tests. From reading various online Rails tutorials and articles about testing, it appeared to me that the course instructors&amp;rsquo; testing methodology was suspect, but who was I to complain, since I was just learning all this stuff myself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That leads to the main problem, which is that of spaghetti code: the &amp;ldquo;Rotten Potatoes&amp;rdquo; app that we modified incrementally had logic spread out all over the place. It was very difficult for me to understand what happened where, and what could happen or could not. There were code paths that involved implicit changes of state and hacking in routes and actions. It all felt wrong. Also, I strongly favor statically typed languages, and using Ruby was rather painful for me: you pull attributes out from thin air, stick them into the controller, and then suddenly you have to know you can use them in the view, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-learned&#34;&gt;What I learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned a huge amount, actually. This was the first time I&amp;rsquo;d systematically work through developing an application from the ground up using &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development&#34;&gt;Test-Driven Development&lt;/a&gt; (TDD) and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development&#34;&gt;Behavior-Driven Development&lt;/a&gt;, for example. &lt;strong&gt;I am completely sold on TDD and BDD now.&lt;/strong&gt; It was very useful writing down, in code, scenarios to expect to happen or not happen, before implementing the behavior. I have issues with Cucumber, the tool, but the process itself, I am sold on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also very satisfying incrementally developing a Rails application that actually did something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it was also useful gaining experience using Git and Heroku.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite rough patches in the course (that I hope will be remedied in a future offering), I found that I learned a lot. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in gaining experience incrementally developing an application, and certainly if desiring to get started with Ruby and Rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope there will be a part two of this course offered, to complete the material from the Berkeley course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-of-2013-12-13&#34;&gt;(Update of 2013-12-13)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been almost two years since I took this course, during which I have not done anything with Rails since, although I have started experimenting with using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.playframework.com/&#34;&gt;Play&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scala-lang.org/&#34;&gt;Scala&lt;/a&gt;, which is similar in spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, this course has moved off Coursera to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.edx.org/&#34;&gt;edX&lt;/a&gt; MOOC platform. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.edx.org/course/uc-berkeleyx/uc-berkeleyx-cs-169-2x-software-service-1005&#34;&gt;Part 2 was offered in August 2013&lt;/a&gt; and a revised version of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.edx.org/course/uc-berkeleyx/uc-berkeleyx-cs169-1x-software-service-1136&#34;&gt;part 1 was offered in September 2013&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;ldquo;The presentation order and amount of time spent on some material is being changed in response to feedback from both on-campus and online students. This run of the class also includes all new videos, two new homeworks and all new exam questions. The new class also includes embedded live chat with Teaching Assistants and other students and opportunities for remote pair programming with other students. Group tutorial Q&amp;amp;A sessions will also be held and broadcast live through Google Hangouts and YouTube.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I presume both parts of the course will continue to be offered in the future. I would like to take part 2 at some point, but that depends on what time I can devote to it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I reflect on my year of 2011 as it ends. Since I did not start blogging until September, I go into more detail of what happened before then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;january&#34;&gt;January&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I continued our project of massively reorganizing our home, a project that began when she moved in during summer 2010. We were very grateful that Abby&amp;rsquo;s father helped out a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I continued getting rid of a lot of stuff, including another eighteen boxes of my books, as I became an initially reluctant &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/minimalism/&#34;&gt;minimalist&lt;/a&gt;. We sold or gave away a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; number of various of belongings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby started cooking much more than in the past, and we enjoyed trying new dishes of her making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I enjoyed some light cross-country skiing in the winter, using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schenley_Park_Golf_Course&#34;&gt;Bob O&amp;rsquo;Connor Golf Course at Schenley Park&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I began a weekly Zen &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/meditation/&#34;&gt;meditation&lt;/a&gt; session offered at Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started moving very gradually toward a &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/paleo/&#34;&gt;paleo&lt;/a&gt; diet and exercise routine, and immediately experienced benefits. &amp;ldquo;The Paleo Solution&amp;rdquo; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://robbwolf.com/&#34;&gt;Robb Wolf&lt;/a&gt; was very useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started learning modern &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/javascript/&#34;&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; for a new project at work, getting into client-side Web development. As part of that, I learned &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/jquery/&#34;&gt;jQuery&lt;/a&gt; through a free &lt;a href=&#34;http://p2pu.org/&#34;&gt;P2PU&lt;/a&gt; course and used it in the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started using &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XQuery&#34;&gt;XQuery&lt;/a&gt; at work to process XML in a clear and concise way. I had used XSLT in the past, but it was very unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decided, for various reasons, to stop writing new &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/perl/&#34;&gt;Perl&lt;/a&gt; scripts and move to &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/python/&#34;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started playing in my final (and disastrous) &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/chess/&#34;&gt;chess&lt;/a&gt; tournament, the Pittsburgh Chess Club Championship (which I had won in 2006 and 2007).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;february&#34;&gt;February&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pittsburgh was all about the Steelers, and I went to a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLV&#34;&gt;Super Bowl&lt;/a&gt; party for the first time, but we lost!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I read &amp;ldquo;The Art of Non-Conformity&amp;rdquo; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://chrisguillebeau.com/&#34;&gt;Chris Guillebeau&lt;/a&gt; and found it so inspiring that I decided to take action and start making big changes to my life, in my own way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One big change: I quit playing chess, cold turkey, after having been unenthusiastic about it for months already (and playing correspondingly poorly). When the passion and enjoyment are gone, there is no point in hanging onto something just because it has been such an important part of my life for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of not playing any music at all, I started playing &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/recorder/&#34;&gt;recorder&lt;/a&gt;, and vowed to play every single day if possible. Ten months later, I am still playing recorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I began attending a lot of &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/16/pittsburgh-software-developer-communities/&#34;&gt;local software developer group meetings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started learning the &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/scala/&#34;&gt;Scala&lt;/a&gt; programming language and decided to use it on a small project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;march&#34;&gt;March&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I continued our meditation practice at CMU, and went to our first mini-&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesshin&#34;&gt;sesshin&lt;/a&gt; on a Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I continued practicing recorder every single day, and joined the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/lukas/pcars/Welcome.html&#34;&gt;local chapter of the American Recorder Society&lt;/a&gt;. It was very exciting to meet new people and to get into a wide range of music I had never really listened to or played.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I saw a video of &lt;a href=&#34;http://jakeshimabukuro.com/&#34;&gt;Jake Shimabukuro&lt;/a&gt; playing &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/ukulele/&#34;&gt;ukulele&lt;/a&gt; so beautifully that I was inspired to buy a ukulele and start learning to play it. (Unfortunately, it would turn out that time constraints caused me not to pursue ukulele far. This will change in 2012.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got pulled into the Ruby programming language because it is well-supported on Mac OS and it is easy to install libraries and tools, of which there are many that are quite useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I went to &lt;a href=&#34;http://farmtotablepa.com/&#34;&gt;Farm to Table&lt;/a&gt; in Pittsburgh, and after that, Abby started moving toward paleo eating, with even better results than my smaller experiments earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I started our &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/hiking/&#34;&gt;hiking&lt;/a&gt; season in the spring. Hiking is special to us; it was one of our first shared activities (after initially meeting during salsa dancing), and one we return to again and again. When there is no calendar conflict and the weather is acceptable, we like hiking almost every weekend from spring through fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% img /images/steves-soup-hike-2011-03-26.jpg Abby in front of me at Steve&amp;rsquo;s Soup Hike %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;april&#34;&gt;April&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started wearing &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/fivefingers/&#34;&gt;Vibram FiveFingers shoes&lt;/a&gt; almost all the time, whether walking or running (but not yet for hiking).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I went to &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/yoga/&#34;&gt;yoga&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.clpgh.org/locations/squirrelhill/&#34;&gt;Squirrel Hill Library&lt;/a&gt; for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;may&#34;&gt;May&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I began my experiment with barefoot running, in observation of &lt;a href=&#34;http://barefootrunners.org/ibrd&#34;&gt;International Barefoot Running Day&lt;/a&gt;. I started walking around barefoot at work, ignoring the confused looks or comments of colleagues. (I still go barefoot at work.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I bought a &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/melodica/&#34;&gt;melodica&lt;/a&gt;, inspired by the amazing performances of &lt;a href=&#34;http://jnote.org/&#34;&gt;James Howard Young&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I took a little vacation, spending some days in New York visiting Nathaniel and Yael and their baby. I finally fulfilled my dream (from before marriage) of taking Abby to Coney Island to walk on the boardwalk and at the beach, eating pizza, and riding the Wonder Wheel, just as I once did when I was six years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I started doing research into major home renovations for the summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I visited my parents, and my sister Linda and her husband Andre also visited, with my mother throwing a delayed reception at home for the both of us who had gotten married in the past two years. Abby got to meet my parents&amp;rsquo; friends, finally. And I went running with my brother-in-law for the first time! Also, I took Abby to the little park in Ann Arbor where as a too-shy teenager I used to go and sit on a particular bench and wish I were sitting with my dream girl. Mission accomplished!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;june&#34;&gt;June&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John and I did a tough 19-mile training hike on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Trail&lt;/a&gt; and decided we&amp;rsquo;d had enough of that trail, and I decided I was probably not going to do the 35-mile &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Trail Challenge&lt;/a&gt; again (having completed it three times in the past).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% img /images/rachel-carson-trail-2011-06-05.jpg John on Rachel Carson Trail %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby started wearing Vibram FiveFingers more and more for walking and running, and even walking barefoot on the streets (something I had not yet seriously done myself at the time).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stupidly threw out my back during exercise, and my back took weeks to fully recover (I could still run and hike, but not lift weights). Never again, I hope. I felt like a 90-year-old when my back was hurting constantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We started some home improvement projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;july&#34;&gt;July&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started gravitating to almost exclusively body weight &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/strength-training/&#34;&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt;, as a reaction to my having injured my back earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I went kayaking on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiskiminetas_River&#34;&gt;Kiski River&lt;/a&gt; with &amp;ldquo;Fireman Steve&amp;rdquo; and the kayaking gang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a longish hike, Abby surprised me by wearing Vibram FiveFingers shoes and they worked great for her, making her much faster and less sore, and I made a note to ditch my trail running shoes (which I had been using for years for hiking) in favor of FiveFingers for my next hike (which I did, and I have not gone back to regular shoes for hiking!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I finally took Abby to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sandhillberries.com/&#34;&gt;Sand Hill Berries&lt;/a&gt; for tasty pie for the first time, always having intended to take her there when dating, but never having been in the vicinity with her then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major home renovation finally began, after much research, and we got electrical upgrade, insulation, and bathroom demolition and rebuilding. Very disruptive to our lives for weeks!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I did another mini-&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesshin&#34;&gt;sesshin&lt;/a&gt; at CMU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a lifetime of almost never drinking coffee (average of maybe three or four cups a year), I became an avid espresso fan (one small cup a day) as a result of my boss getting a machine at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started doing more barefoot running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;august&#34;&gt;August&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bathroom renovation done at last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I were regularly hiking in Vibram FiveFingers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% img /images/abby-franklin-soup-hike-vibram.jpg Abby and Franklin on Steve&amp;rsquo;s Soup Hike part 3 wearing Vibram FiveFingers %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby joined me to run in her first ever 5K race, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.runaroundthesquare.com/&#34;&gt;Run Around the Square&lt;/a&gt; in Regent Square (mostly on the trails of Frick Park). What a special day! This race was my first ever 5K race when I started running in races in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started to learn &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/accordion/&#34;&gt;accordion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;september&#34;&gt;September&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started running to work two or three times a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I ran in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kalp/PGR/&#34;&gt;CMU SCS Pretty Good Race 5K&lt;/a&gt; together, her second 5K race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I went to &lt;a href=&#34;http://podcamppittsburgh.com/&#34;&gt;PodCamp Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;, and after that, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/09/22/starting-a-new-web-site/&#34;&gt;I started this blog&lt;/a&gt; and proceeded to maintain a habit of posting every day (a routine that has been modified since then).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;october&#34;&gt;October&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started expanding beyond just writing for my blog, and began contributing to the Web through &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/franklinchen&#34;&gt;my Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; as well as writing comments on other people&amp;rsquo;s blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started taking Stanford online classes: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ml-class.org/&#34;&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.db-class.org/&#34;&gt;Introduction to Databases&lt;/a&gt;. (Blog posts on my experiences to appear soon.) Unfortunately, as a result of the extra time commitment, October through December were quite hectic for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I continued to move more toward a paleo diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;november&#34;&gt;November&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started playing &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/flute/&#34;&gt;flute&lt;/a&gt; again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably because of fatigue and a compromised immune system, I came down with a skin ailment that I got serious treatment for, but it took almost two months to completely clear up and I spent over a month truly miserable &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;december&#34;&gt;December&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started playing Baroque flute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started playing tin whistle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I prepared for and made it through two music performances, playing recorder and flute (and almost tin whistle).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ended the year completely exhausted, on the verge of getting sick, and took a long break from blogging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final week, Abby and I were on a hectic travel schedule that involved meeting up with her parents, my parents, her sister Carrie, Carrie&amp;rsquo;s boyfriend Alain, Alain&amp;rsquo;s parents, Alain&amp;rsquo;s extended family, my sister Linda, and her husband Andre. I am grateful that we got to meet up with so many people (and arranged for various of the individuals to meet up with various of the others!), but the trip was quite stressful to me, because I was not physically or emotionally prepared for it at all. (I will report later on what I learned from the experience.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2011 was quite a year for me and Abby. We had many changes and adventures in our lives: our home, our diet, our exercise, our outdoors activities, travel. For me, the biggest changes were quitting chess, starting music practice and performance, throwing myself into blogging and tweeting, getting more and more active in local software developer groups, applying new (to me) development tools at work, and in the fall, taking Stanford online courses in computer science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I ended the year in poor shape, because of being overbooked, I am very excited by how many positive changes took place. I have an entirely new set of plans and priorities to formulate soon for 2012 in collaboration with Abby, in hope of learning from the lessons of my failures and omissions of 2011, and restoring balance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Revisiting Knuth and McIlroy&#39;s word count programs</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/12/08/revisiting-knuth-and-mcilroys-word-count-programs/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Dec 2011 21:46:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/12/08/revisiting-knuth-and-mcilroys-word-count-programs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I came across a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2011/12/more-shell-less-egg/&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; revisiting &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Bentley&#34;&gt;Jon Bentley&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s challenge in 1986 to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-cs-staff.stanford.edu/~uno/&#34;&gt;Donald Knuth&lt;/a&gt; to write a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming&#34;&gt;literate program&lt;/a&gt; to solve a sample task and have &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/&#34;&gt;Doug McIlroy&lt;/a&gt; critique it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Read a file of text, determine the n most frequently used words, and print out a sorted list of those words along with their frequencies.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knuth came up with a typically clever, lengthy, low-level implementation. McIlroy then somewhat perversely wrote a six-line shell script that did the job, basically changing the subject away from literate programming and toward a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.princeton.edu/~hos/mike/transcripts/mcilroy.htm&#34;&gt;critique of Knuth&amp;rsquo;s doing something low-level and complicated when unnecessary&lt;/a&gt;. The article publishing both Knuth&amp;rsquo;s and McIlroy&amp;rsquo;s solutions is &lt;a href=&#34;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=315654&#34;&gt;available here&lt;/a&gt;. A followup article with David Hanson&amp;rsquo;s implementation in C is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.upc.edu/~eipec/pdf/p583-van_wyk.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to bring the discussion here a quarter of a century (25 years!) to the present. How would we solve the problem now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-of-2013-06-29&#34;&gt;(Update of 2013-06-29)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have changed my mind about many things I said here, and also have more clarifications and new arguments to make, which I will eventually post on my new programming blog, &lt;a href=&#34;http://ConscientiousProgrammer.com/&#34;&gt;The Conscientious Programmer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;salient-points-of-mcilroy-s-solution&#34;&gt;Salient points of McIlroy&amp;rsquo;s solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let&amp;rsquo;s look at McIlroy&amp;rsquo;s solution, which despite the passing of time is still a beautifully elegant illustration of why &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/13/why-dennis-ritchie-is-important/&#34;&gt;Unix is timeless&lt;/a&gt;. (By the way, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1193856&#34;&gt;Knuth is a C and Linux user to this day&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34; style=&#34;background: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;line-height: 125%&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;tr -cs A-Za-z &lt;span style=&#34;color: #BA2121&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;\n&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; |
tr A-Z a-z |
sort |
uniq -c |
sort -rn |
sed &lt;span style=&#34;color: #BB6688; font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #19177C&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #BB6688; font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;q
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The code is self-explanatory if you are familiar with basic Unix command-line tools. The pipeline just transforms data starting from standard input until the desired result is computed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is beautiful about the code is that it decomposes the solution to intuitively and does not require any mutable state. McIlroy&amp;rsquo;s program is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional&#34;&gt;purely functional&lt;/a&gt; program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-a-general-purpose-programming-language-instead&#34;&gt;Using a general-purpose programming language instead&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought to myself, how would I write the program today? Especially if I thought I would need to modify it, add new features? The shell script does the job for the problem as stated, but would clearly be hard to extend. Indeed, historically, &amp;ldquo;scripting languages&amp;rdquo; such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK&#34;&gt;Awk&lt;/a&gt; were invented in order to do more than simple shell scripts were suitable for, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.perl.org/&#34;&gt;Perl&lt;/a&gt; was Larry Wall&amp;rsquo;s response to Awk, to create a truly general-purpose language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, in 2011, languages and libraries are at a sufficiently high level that a program almost as concise as McIlroy&amp;rsquo;s could be written in Perl, Ruby, Python, or even the latest versions of Java, C#, etc. I&amp;rsquo;ll leave that as an exercise for you (feel free to post your solutions as comments below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;haskell&#34;&gt;Haskell&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I present a simple program in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.haskell.org/&#34;&gt;Haskell&lt;/a&gt; that I feel is closest to McIlroy&amp;rsquo;s both in spirit and in letter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my Haskell program, in two variants. The first is a standard source code file, while the second uses Haskell&amp;rsquo;s built-in support for its own notion of &amp;ldquo;literate programming&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/1448622.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.haskell.org/ghc/&#34;&gt;GHC&lt;/a&gt; to compile and run the program.  Sample output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34; style=&#34;background: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;line-height: 125%&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000080; font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; ghc -O6 --make WordCount
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000080; font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; ./WordCount &lt;span style=&#34;color: #666666&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; WordCount.lhs
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #888888&#34;&gt;35 the&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #888888&#34;&gt;16 a&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #888888&#34;&gt;11 list&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #888888&#34;&gt;10 of&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #888888&#34;&gt;9 text&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #888888&#34;&gt;9 for&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #888888&#34;&gt;8 n&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #888888&#34;&gt;8 map&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #888888&#34;&gt;8 count&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #888888&#34;&gt;7 string&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Apart from missing leading spaces, this is the same output as from McIlroy&amp;rsquo;s shell script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The literate program above explains each step of the Haskell &amp;ldquo;pipeline&amp;rdquo; I constructed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-i-don-t-do-literate-programming&#34;&gt;Why I don&amp;rsquo;t do literate programming&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t currently use &amp;ldquo;literate programming&amp;rdquo; systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I experimented with programming in C and C++ and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML&#34;&gt;Standard ML&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb/&#34;&gt;noweb&lt;/a&gt; over a decade ago, but found that for myself, it was not really beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was little benefit in being able to rearrange code fragments at will. Furthermore, spreading code out interspersed with a lot of prose made it harder for me to actually &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)&#34;&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt; meaning out of a spatial portion of text in my editor window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, modern languages and programming styles make it much easier to express things concisely and less monolithically, such that I find that using ordinary comments suffices for my needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find that literate programming in the Knuth style amounts to a macro system that distorts the layout of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, literate programming interacts badly with editors and IDEs that are built specifically to operate on pure source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think? Which of the variants of the same Haskell code above would you prefer to write, read, or maintain? The non-literate one or the literate one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-alternative-to-literate-programming&#34;&gt;An alternative to literate programming&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should note that in practice, I would write suitable comments in a non-literate program primarily before the function definition. Also, I would not use such a large pipeline of expressions either: I would break out almost every line of the pipeline into its own little function, with its own comment. That is how I would actually write a nontrivial Haskell program, writing one or two line functions and testing each of them, before trying to hook them all up into a big pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &amp;ldquo;cheated&amp;rdquo; in this case because McIlroy&amp;rsquo;s program already existed, so I simply translated it into a Haskell equivalent without real thought and testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;comparison-between-the-shell-script-and-the-haskell-program&#34;&gt;Comparison between the shell script and the Haskell program&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shell script operates on raw text and everything is just strings being parsed and reparsed by the respective Unix utility programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Haskell program is &lt;em&gt;statically typed&lt;/em&gt;. It is type-checked by the compiler, which generates native code. The program uses standard libraries and data types, such as lists and hash maps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the Haskell program could be refined, extended, optimized in various ways. The most important optimizations I can think of off the top of my head:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a better representation of strings than the default built-in &amp;ldquo;string as list of characters&amp;rdquo;. Easily accessible advice can be found on &lt;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/576213/efficient-string-implementation-in-haskell&#34;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt; and browsing through Haskell library documentation, such as for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/text&#34;&gt;text&lt;/a&gt; package.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loop fusion, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation_(computer_science)&#34;&gt;deforestation&lt;/a&gt; can be applied to deal with the &lt;em&gt;apparent&lt;/em&gt; allocation of lots of new lists in the pipeline. One of the selling points of using a language like Haskell is the opportunity for the compiler to perform radical optimizations that are impossible for languages that have side effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t write many &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt; scripts these days. General-purpose programming languages can do a decent job munging data without difficulty. The situation was different decades ago when there was C, and few standard high-level libraries for the C world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am skeptical of literate programming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;McIlroy was ahead of his time, but that time has passed; we should take his contributions as inspiration to move further forward already, using advanced general-purpose programming languages.&lt;/li&gt;
