      <title>Reflections on my slowest Run Around the Square 5K in 13 years</title>

      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/08/24/reflections-on-my-slowest-run-around-the-square-5k-in-13-years/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year was the ninth time I ran in the annual &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.runaroundthesquare.com/&#34;&gt;Run Around The Square 5K race&lt;/a&gt;, and Abby&amp;rsquo;s third year in a row. The conditions were great: cool and dry, in contrast to the usual hot and humid conditions at this time of year. (Last year I reported on &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/08/25/my-eighth-time-doing-run-around-the-square-5k/&#34;&gt;my eighth running of the race&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Abby and I ran this race rather slowly, but were happy and enjoyed the day. Here&amp;rsquo;s why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;both-of-us-coming-back-from-setbacks&#34;&gt;Both of us coming back from setbacks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to note is that both Abby and I have been recovering from setbacks this year, as I reported two weeks ago after I ran the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/08/09/getting-up-when-reality-punches-you-in-the-face-running-the-second-liberty-mile-in-pittsburgh/&#34;&gt;second GNC Live Well Liberty Mile&lt;/a&gt; 18 seconds slower than last year. That race had me vowing to get back on track, and the very next day I did &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/08/10/emerging-from-my-three-months-of-illness-self-pitying-and-self-loathing/&#34;&gt;begin getting back on track&lt;/a&gt;. The road back to a regular exercise routine has not been easy in the past two weeks, but I have very gradually ramping up on running as well as minimal strength training every single day since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, I ran the Run Around The Square 5K in 24:35.6 and was pretty to have recovered from several years of decline in fitness and self-care, by running my best time since 2006. For this year, I wrote, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what goal to set for next year. I suppose I could set a goal of getting yet faster, breaking 24:15. That sounds reasonable to me. Going back down to 24:00 may even be possible. It&amp;rsquo;s too early right now to tell. But one thing is for sure: I have no intention of slowing down from this year to next.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I did not set a firm enough goal. I have learned the hard way that if you don&amp;rsquo;t make a commitment (and then follow up with the discipline and sacrifices required to achieve it), then even in the absence of accidents, a maybe-goal is worthless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, I went into the 5K race so untrained (two weeks of slowly ramping up before the race is not enough for any training benefits to kick in) that I basically knew that I was going to be super slow. I figured that since I lost 18 seconds in the mile, I would be happy if I lost only one minute in a 3K. So that was my expectation: finish around 25:36 this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;before-the-race&#34;&gt;Before the race&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided that this was the race in which I debut my new orange running singlet, to replace my over-decade use of a blue singlet that Abby has gotten very annoyed with:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/run-around-the-square-2013/franklin-orange.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin wearing orange singlet&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Also, note that since I bought a SPIbelt earlier this year, I now always run races wearing a SPIbelt to carry my phone. This is particularly convenient when running a race where you have to park far from the start line and want access to your phone after a race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wore my Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek shoes again. Since last year&amp;rsquo;s fiasco in which I &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/09/30/running-my-10th-great-race-10k-obscene-but-in-a-good-way/&#34;&gt;injured my left foot from having the straps on my left foot too tight&lt;/a&gt;, I never again put the straps on too tight!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hanging out before the race start in Regent Square:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/run-around-the-square-2013/before.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Before start&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/run-around-the-square-2013/franklin-ready.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin ready&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Start line just a few minutes before race start:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/run-around-the-square-2013/start-line.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Start line&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-race&#34;&gt;The race&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;http://runhigh.com/2013RESULTS/R082413AA.html&#34;&gt;Race results.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;different-race-logistics&#34;&gt;Different race logistics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One very important change to the race, and one I greatly appreciated, was the staggered start. Faster runners were told to line up front and start up first. This is very helpful to control the congestion and confusion that happens in a large race when too many slower people start up front and have to be passed (including unfortunately young children that Abby and I have seen trampled on every year!). In particular, it is really tricky to be passing lots of people once in the trails of Frick Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;first-mile&#34;&gt;First mile&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the ridiculous problems I created for myself by going too fast two weeks ago in the Liberty Mile, I vowed to go out at a reasonable pace in this 5K. I found this easy to do because of the staggered start, which meant that there were fewer people to have to accelerate past throwing off one&amp;rsquo;s own internal speedometer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usual lot of young and old musicians were playing music along the course. What a great neighborhood tradition!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still get confused seeing the champagne stop near the end of the first mile at the entrance into the trails of Frick Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did the first mile in a leisurely 8:15 (compared to 7:18 last year).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;second-mile&#34;&gt;Second mile&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did the second mile in 10:17 (compared to 10:11 last year). I did not feel too bad. I was running a bit conservatively, because my training runs had been so slow and short and tough for me in the past two weeks. I wanted to be in position to run really well the final downhill in the third mile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;third-mile&#34;&gt;Third mile&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I let loose in the third mile. Because I had avoided going pukey in the second mile, I covered it in 7:06, actually a second faster than the 7:07 of last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the staggered start, there was not bad congestion during the third mile, and I found it safe to pass people at will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;final-sprint&#34;&gt;Final sprint&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a gut-wrenching final sprint. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t even looking at the clock or my watch. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t one of those races in which I put it all out there on the course. Instead, this was a race where I was grateful to be running at all, and had no expectations other than to finish strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I finished in 25:38, just a bit longer than a minute over last year&amp;rsquo;s 24:35.6. My &lt;em&gt;slowest&lt;/em&gt; Run Around The Square 5K time &lt;em&gt;in 13 years&lt;/em&gt;. But it was a clean finish, and I was so excited to simply be back and running faster than 26 minutes, at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;after-the-race&#34;&gt;After the race&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I was not pukey, I was certainly breathing hard when I finished.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/run-around-the-square-2013/franklin-after.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin after the race&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I went off to drink water and start eating some food.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/run-around-the-square-2013/view.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;View&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;improvement&#34;&gt;Improvement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I went back to the finish line to wait for Abby to finish. I saw Todd and his wife Gabrielle hanging around. Gabrielle said she took my &amp;ldquo;advice&amp;rdquo; (from last year) to go all out to the point of feeling pukey. I admitted that this time around, I didn&amp;rsquo;t follow my own advice. Gabrielle finished over 5 minutes faster this year than last year!! Todd finished over 8 minutes faster!! It&amp;rsquo;s great to see people in their late 40s improve their fitness so much in a single year. I saw the couple running together a couple of times in Frick Park this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;decline&#34;&gt;Decline&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby finished. She was out of breath and pukey, but I was proud of her for finishing. Because of the tremendous decline in health and fitness she has experienced this year, I was not sure she would actually finish the race.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/run-around-the-square-2013/abby-finish.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Abby finishing&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-food-and-refreshments&#34;&gt;More food and refreshments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We lined up to sample more food and recovered. It was a beautiful day to be outside.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/run-around-the-square-2013/abby-recovered.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/run-around-the-square-2013/franklin-recovered.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The hot dogs and beer line was particularly long, but we finally reached the tables.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/run-around-the-square-2013/hot-dogs-beer.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Hot dogs and beer&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;walking-out-of-frick-park-back-to-the-car&#34;&gt;Walking out of Frick Park back to the car&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help taking a photo of the sign for beer and champagne that was still up on the trail entrance as we passed by:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/run-around-the-square-2013/beer-champagne.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Dunning&amp;#39;s beer and champagne stop&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;concern-about-abby&#34;&gt;Concern about Abby&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I was happy that Abby managed to finish the 5K race, I was very concerned about her overall health and fitness, which have continued to be poor this year since she broke her foot in February. Here are her Run Around The Square 5K times since she started doing it with me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2011: 37:15&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2012: 36:04&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2013: 39:54&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was almost 4 minutes slower than last year. She&amp;rsquo;s lost &lt;em&gt;several years of fitness&lt;/em&gt; this year, and came in 105th of 116 in her age group. Again, we are grateful she is walking and running at all, but this has been a very bad year for her, and this impacts not only her own life, but ours more generally. We need to work on getting her back on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;goal-for-next-year&#34;&gt;Goal for next year?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, my real goal is to simply continue my exercise program and not break it again, and that includes the winter slump I usually enter. Last year, I had a slump in the final months of the year, and then woke up and &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/12/28/meditations-on-climbing-the-36-floors-of-the-pitt-cathedral-of-learning/&#34;&gt;started exercising again around New Year&lt;/a&gt;, and even signed up for the Pittsburgh Marathon as a way to force myself to stay active in the winter. I believe that if I simply avoid self-caused setbacks, I should be able to return myself to a decent level of fitness. I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; going to sign up for the Pittsburgh Marathon again. Almost certainly, however, I will sign up for the Pittsburgh Half Marathon! Last winter, I rather enjoyed &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/03/30/report-on-just-a-short-run-my-first-half-marathon-in-nine-years/&#34;&gt;training for and running the Just A Short Run half marathon&lt;/a&gt;. I reached good fitness through that, but squandered my fitness through overtraining and injury leading up to the marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;races-this-year&#34;&gt;Races this year&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the shorter term, I have two races to run in the coming month: the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/09/07/running-my-8th-pretty-good-race-5k-dealing-with-disappointment/&#34;&gt;CMU Pretty Good Race 5K&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/09/30/running-my-10th-great-race-10k-obscene-but-in-a-good-way/&#34;&gt;Great Race 10K&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, I did very poorly in the Pretty Good Race 5K because I was injured and exhausted, running 26:05. This year, I expect to do better than that. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to do the 24:36 of 2011, but given that I easily beat 26 minutes today, I will beat 26 minutes two weeks from now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Great Race 10K last year, I was still in a state of exhaustion and undertraining, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t even pay any attention to time goals, and finished slowly in 48:23. I see no reason why, if I continue improving my fitness in the next month (in contrast to last year&amp;rsquo;s dreadful September), I should not be able to run under 48:00.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;update-of-2013-09-06&#34;&gt;(Update of 2013-09-06)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/09/06/was-it-worth-sprinting-to-a-terrible-fall-to-finish-25th-in-the-cmu-pretty-good-race-5k/&#34;&gt;my report on running the Pretty Good Race 5K this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run Around The Square continued to thrive and improve, and I&amp;rsquo;m grateful for both the registration cap (to maintain the quality of the event) as well as the staggered start. And all the sponsors feeding us afterwards!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby and I were happy to have finished the race, even if we are both less fit now than we have been in years. But I think this is a wake up call for us to get back in shape. For example, I miss the long hikes we used to do last year when we had the stamina to actually do and enjoy them. The example Todd and Gabrielle set as they massively improved their fitness in the past year is inspiring. Abby and I should be able to do this too, if we make it a priority.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Getting up when reality punches you in the face: running the second Liberty Mile in Pittsburgh</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/08/09/getting-up-when-reality-punches-you-in-the-face-running-the-second-liberty-mile-in-pittsburgh/</link>

      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/08/09/getting-up-when-reality-punches-you-in-the-face-running-the-second-liberty-mile-in-pittsburgh/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/08/17/the-inaugural-liberty-mile-a-review-of-pittsburghs-first-road-mile-race/&#34;&gt;I reported on the excitement I had running in and watching&lt;/a&gt; the first &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.libertymile.org/&#34;&gt;GNC Live Well Liberty Mile&lt;/a&gt;. I was so excited about running it again that late this May, having mostly recovered from my &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/05/06/2013-pittsburgh-marathon-my-135th-race-was-my-worst-i-finished/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Marathon disaster&lt;/a&gt;, I quickly pre-registered for the Liberty Mile for this year. I anticipated training to run well in this year&amp;rsquo;s Liberty Mile, given that I was not really trained last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this year I have been in very poor shape since the marathon, because of a whole series of health problems and disruptions in my life resulting from a skin rash I got during a &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/05/12/my-rachel-carson-trail-hike-for-the-year/&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Trail hike in May&lt;/a&gt;. The upshot is that I have been running (and exercising in general) very little in the past three months. As the Liberty Mile approached, I wished that I had not registered for it at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I faced a dilemma: what should I do about the race?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;deciding-to-run-it&#34;&gt;Deciding to run it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good thing about the mile is that it&amp;rsquo;s short enough that of course I can finish the thing. So I felt there was no excuse to just bail out and forfeit my pre-registration. I was going to run it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bad thing about the mile is that it is brutal to actually run &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;. I have always felt pukey after running a mile as &amp;ldquo;fast&amp;rdquo; as I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, I decided to still try to run the Liberty Mile as fast as I could, knowing that I would probably suffer for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to go out periodically for short, slow runs, something like two miles at a time, to gain at least have &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; kind of conditioning. Also, earlier this week I put in some &amp;ldquo;fast&amp;rdquo; repeats of about 300m out in Frick Park: the only &amp;ldquo;fast&amp;rdquo; running I&amp;rsquo;ve done since April!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this whole week I was feeling bad, stress exacerbated by home repair disruptions with the contractors coming over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;support-from-abby&#34;&gt;Support from Abby&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, I went to the race alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, Abby offered to go downtown with me so she could watch the race and be with me. (In May when I was pre-registering for the race, she had just spent months barely mobile because of a broken foot and was simply not certain she would be able to even run a mile again by August.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really appreciated this because I felt rather vulnerable about this race. We planned to watch the first wave start, and then have me run my heat (again the &amp;ldquo;Unstoppable 40+&amp;rdquo; heat), then hang out afterwards and watch the elite heats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We drove downtown and parked and walked to the packet pickup area in Market Square. I was pleased that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t raining; it had rained earlier in the day, but that was all over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we arrived later than other people, they had run out of Small T-shirts and so I got a Medium.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/liberty-mile-2013/abby.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Abby holding my T-shirt&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;changes-in-the-course&#34;&gt;Changes in the course&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should note that the course was changed from last year. The change makes sense because it considerably simplifies the logistics. Last year, the course was a straight shot down Liberty Ave toward downtown. This year, the course was an almost-loop course, first going out on Penn Ave, then turning to head back in on Liberty Ave. The advantage is that the start and finish are close together, so it is much easier for people to plan to spectate or get back to their cars or whatever. I do like the concept of the straight downhill road course, but understand the logistical difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan was to do my best to avoid going out too fast, and try to push hard in the final downhill portion of the race. Easier said than done, because last year I certainly wanted to avoid going out too fast, but did anyway!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;before-the-race&#34;&gt;Before the race&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wore my Vibram FiveFingers Bikila LS shoes again.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At the GNC booth, I saw they were giving out free samples of energy bars and other stuff. I was feeling hungry, and although I know that it is best not to race having just eaten, especially unfamiliar foods, I took a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gnc.com/product/index.jsp?productId=4468895&#34;&gt;GNC Pro Performance Pro Crunch Lite&lt;/a&gt; energy bar, and ate a couple of bites before giving the remainder to Abby to put away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was probably a big mistake to have eaten from the energy bar, because it didn&amp;rsquo;t really agree with me. Oops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;start-and-finish-lines&#34;&gt;Start and finish lines&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We checked out the start and finish lines.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Start line&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Finish line&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-heat-at-7-00-pm&#34;&gt;First heat (at 7:00 PM)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We watched as the first &amp;ldquo;fun run&amp;rdquo; heat went.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/liberty-mile-2013/first-heat-start.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-race-heat-at-7-20-pm&#34;&gt;My race (heat at 7:20 PM)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to the start line and lined up &lt;em&gt;at the back&lt;/em&gt;, where I knew I belonged. I was not sure that I would not be last place in my heat!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/liberty-mile-2013/my-heat-start.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here I am, looking as tired as I in fact was, still taking medication for my skin problem that is not completely gone (usually showing up as spots on my neck or hands and arms):&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/liberty-mile-2013/franklin-before.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin before the race&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As the race began, I tried not to go too fast, but did. 1:34 for the first quarter mile, not good at all! Last year, I ran the mile in 6:39, and went out in 1:29 for the first quarter. This year, I was hoping to go under 7:00 at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I slowed down for the second quarter, then finally found a steady pace for the third quarter. During the final quarter, I saw the finish line and eventually saw the clock ticking up toward 7:00. I was &lt;em&gt;furious&lt;/em&gt; that I might not be able to finish a 7-minute mile. I sprinted all out and didn&amp;rsquo;t actually finish under 7:00 according to the clock (the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.areep.com/events/libertymile/&#34;&gt;official race results&lt;/a&gt; say I finished in 7:02), but my chip time was 6:56, so I actually did run the mile in under 7 minutes!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My splits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1:34 (went too fast)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1:56 (uphill, deliberately slowed down)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1:46 (steady)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1:40 (final kick)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-photos-of-the-liberty-mile&#34;&gt;More photos of the Liberty Mile&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More photos of the entire event can be seen &lt;a href=&#34;http://petemadia.photoshelter.com/gallery/2013-GNC-Live-Well-Liberty-Mile/G0000gQc.MfyoOAE/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;after-my-race&#34;&gt;After my race&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, I felt really, really crappy:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/liberty-mile-2013/done-in-pain.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin done for a while but still in pain&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In fact, for a full half hour after the race, all I could do was walk and sit around with Abby trying to feel less crappy. &lt;strong&gt;I have never felt so bad for so long after any race of any distance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reflections&#34;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mentally, also, I was still very &lt;em&gt;angry&lt;/em&gt; at myself: I came in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.areep.com/events/libertymile/results/13lm_uno.txt&#34;&gt;60th place out of 74&lt;/a&gt;, running a chip time of 6:56, a whopping &lt;em&gt;18 seconds&lt;/em&gt; slower than last year. That&amp;rsquo;s a huge decrease in fitness for a mile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan for this year, 2013, was supposed to be to get back into great health and fitness, &amp;ldquo;the shape I was in five years ago&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s why, for the new year, I got into &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/12/28/meditations-on-climbing-the-36-floors-of-the-pitt-cathedral-of-learning/&#34;&gt;climbing the Cathedral of Learning&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s why I got into running in the winter](/blog/2012/12/31/why-i-went-frick-park-trail-running-in-snowfall-for-the-first-time-in-a-decade/). It&amp;rsquo;s why I &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/01/30/why-and-how-i-am-going-to-run-the-2013-pittsburgh-marathon/&#34;&gt;decided to run the Pittsburgh Marathon&lt;/a&gt;. I blew it my overtraining for the marathon and then suffering freak skin problems after a hike that ended up seeing doctors something like five times, and being put on medication that messed with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a lot to be angry about. But after I recovered, I became calm and stopped being angry about being punched in the face by reality. I decided that it was motivation for me to turn my life around. I decided that I was going to get back into a regular exercise routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In just the past three months, I have lost all of my fitness of the past several years. But I have a plan to get back on track, starting &lt;em&gt;tomorrow&lt;/em&gt;. I believe that for 2014, I can still get back into my 2008 shape. It&amp;rsquo;s a matter of making it a priority, over all the other things I have been doing in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;going-home&#34;&gt;Going home&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I recovered enough that I felt like eating and walking again, Abby and I went back to our car and we went home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only minutes after getting home did I realize that I had &lt;em&gt;totally forgotten&lt;/em&gt; to stick around to watch the elite runners&amp;rsquo; races!! That was far from my mind when I was feeling nauseous and reflecting on my poor fitness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The race was very well organized, and I&amp;rsquo;m thankful for the continuation of this new Pittsburgh tradition. Although I had a humbling experience in my heat, I totally want to be back for a third try at executing a good mile next year! And I am thankful that I actually ran it, because it gave me the resolve to regain my lost fitness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Five reasons we just stocked up on Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek shoes</title>

      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/08/28/five-reasons-we-just-stocked-up-on-vibram-fivefingers-kso-trek-shoes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/85802484@N06/7858001266&#34; title=&#34;&amp;quot;Run Around the Square&amp;quot;, Regent Square by sherpes39, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7253/7858001266_58020e37f8.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;375&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;Run Around the Square&amp;quot;, Regent Square&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby and I just stocked up on Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek shoes: we got &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; brand new pairs for me and &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; for her as well. Why the extravagant purchases? Here are five reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reason-1-trail-running&#34;&gt;Reason 1: trail running&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2010, I bought my first pair of KSO Trek shoes, primarily for the purpose of trail running, since I was sick and tired of the knee and shin and blistering problems I seemed to have whenever trail running extensively in any regular shoes, and I wanted more durability and protection against rocks than I got from running in less built-up racing flats meant for road running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I had bought the KSO shoes earlier, but they just weren&amp;rsquo;t, for me, suitable for much trail running, because of blistering issues and lack of protection (later, as I got used to more minimalist running, the protection no longer became an issue, but the blistering remained, so the last time I did trail running in the KSO shoes as a test was in June for &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/06/06/i-celebrated-national-running-day-in-schenley-park-remembering-how-i-began-to-run-13-year-ago/&#34;&gt;National Running Day&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a little bit of breaking in, during which I had a few blisters, &lt;em&gt;I never got blistered again, for two years and counting&lt;/em&gt;. The kangaroo leather is very nice and quickly seems to conform to your feet and becomes smooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have never run in the trails with my old regular monotoed running shoes again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have never experienced knee or shin problems again when trail running.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reason-2-hiking&#34;&gt;Reason 2: hiking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, I resisted the idea of wearing the KSO Trek hiking, because my typical hike involves terrain considerably rougher than my local trail runs, and goes on for more hours. But a year ago, in August 2011, following the lead of Abby, who started hiking in her Trek Sport shoes (which are similar to the KSO Trek in protection but are not made of kangaroo leather), I finally shed my &amp;ldquo;trail running&amp;rdquo; shoes that I had been hiking in, reluctantly, for several years (even though I always ended up with some knee/shin/calf/ankle/foot pain/soreness and some blistering on long hikes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;starting-out-with-6-miles&#34;&gt;Starting out with 6 miles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first KSO Trek hiking experience was on a hike that was only 6 miles long. But that experience was a revelation. I had &lt;em&gt;no problems&lt;/em&gt; at all during the hike. I just had some tightness in my right shin after that hike, undoubtedly due to imperfect form. But no blistering, and no lasting foot soreness. As a result, &lt;em&gt;I have never hiked again in regular monotoed shoes, but only in KSO Trek shoes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;moving-up-to-20-miles&#34;&gt;Moving up to 20 miles&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/kso-trek/rachel-carson-trail.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;On the Rachel Carson Trail&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This May, I decided I wanted to really put the KSO Trek to the test. I wore the shoes on my most extreme hike of this year, a 20-mile training hike on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://rachelcarsontrails.org/rct&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Trail&lt;/a&gt;. I finished the hike with no blisters whatsoever, no knee pain. Yes, my feet were sore as heck after all the banging on rocks and tree roots and down the hills, but foot soreness always happened anyway whenever I did a 20-mile hike on the Rachel Carson Trail in any footwear. The interesting thing is that I recovered from this foot soreness extremely quickly, much more quickly than I ever recovered from foot soreness wearing more padded shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I cannot answer the fascinating question of whether I could do the 35-mile &lt;a href=&#34;http://rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Trail Challenge&lt;/a&gt; in KSO Trek shoes. I have completed the Challenge three times, each time with a different pair of regular monotoed trail running shoes, and each time with leg and foot issues (including severe blisters). The reason I cannot answer the question is that my feet were noticeably &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; sore after 20 miles on the trail in KSO Trek than they ever were in the regular shoes. There might be a problem with scalability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;injinji-socks&#34;&gt;Injinji socks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, earlier, in March, I had gone on a really tough hilly, bushwhacking exploratory hike that was about 10 miles long, and worn Injinji toe socks with my KSO Trek shoes. The socks provided additional protection that completely removed foot soreness. Unfortunately, I simply did not enjoy the extra bulk around my toes, and therefore have chosen not to wear socks again except when necessary in cold weather. But it is certainly conceivable that with socks, 35 miles on the Rachel Carson might be doable with KSO Trek shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-recent-hike&#34;&gt;A recent hike&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby and I enjoyed &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.trails.com/tcatalog_trail.aspx?trailid=HGS212-001&#34;&gt;Atalaya Mountain&lt;/a&gt; in Santa Fe this month when we were in New Mexico. She wore her Trek Sport, I wore my KSO Trek.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/kso-trek/atalaya-abby.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Abby with Trek Sport&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/kso-trek/atalaya-franklin.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin with KSO Trek&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;reason-3-paddling&#34;&gt;Reason 3: paddling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point, Abby and I decided to start wearing Vibram FiveFingers shoes kayaking. I started off wearing the KSO, but then realized that wearing the KSO Trek offered a lot of advantages with no down side. Being thicker and leather, they protected better against being under the sun. The extra protection when stepping out into the water and onto rocky shores was also welcome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rio-grande-paddling.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Kayaking down the Rio Grande&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Down the Rio Grande in New Mexico, with view of Sandia Crest.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;no-shoe-funk&#34;&gt;No shoe funk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://birthdayshoes.com/the-definitive-guide-to-cleaning-vibram-five-fingers-a-k-a-how-to-get-the-smell-out-of-your-vibrams&#34;&gt;infamous problem that the synthetic Vibram shoes tend to end up stinking&lt;/a&gt; after getting wet, even after washing! Abby and I found no perfect solution to this problem. It turns out that the leather shoes don&amp;rsquo;t suffer from this problem &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;. All I have to do is rinse the shoes thoroughly (without even any soap or detergent), air dry them, and then they are just fine. Believe it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reason-4-holes-in-my-toes-after-two-years-and-over-a-thousand-miles&#34;&gt;Reason 4: holes in my toes after two years and over a thousand miles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;discovering-holes-on-vulcan&#34;&gt;Discovering holes on Vulcan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know when holes started forming in my KSO Trek shoes from 2010, because I did not have a habit of checking regularly for holes. I only know that I started feeling the ground with my toes only after a particular outing during which I spent over an hour running the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nps.gov/petr/planyourvisit/volcanoes.htm&#34;&gt;three Petroglyph volcanoes&lt;/a&gt; near Albuquerque this month.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/kso-trek/petroglyph-volcanoes.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Panorama of Petroglyph volcanoes&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/kso-trek/franklin-petroglyph-volcanoes.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin getting ready to run the volcanoes&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I was fairly high up on Vulcan and descending when I first noticed the sensations of volcanic rock rubbing on my bare toe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Here&amp;rsquo;s Abby hiking toward Vulcan after I had already run down and was headed the other way.)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/kso-trek/abby-hiking-to-vulcan.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Abby hiking to Vulcan&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;examining-the-holes&#34;&gt;Examining the holes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the holes, which occurred at the sides of the second toes of both my feet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/kso-trek/hole-in-left.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Hole in left shoe&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/kso-trek/hole-in-right.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Hole in right shoe&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Abby and I ordered and received our new shoes (Abby decided to finally also go for KSO Treks, after seeing how much I loved them in the past two years), I took some photos to illustrate the wear and tear:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/kso-trek/old-and-new.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the old shoes are pretty worn down:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/kso-trek/old-new-bottom.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/kso-trek/old-new-side.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to retire the old shoes yet, of course. I kind of like that they have, through being worn down, become more minimalist; feeling a little bit of dirt touch my toes once in a while is no problem at all (especially given my experiments with entirely barefoot running). I expect to continue to wear the old shoes for years to come; I did just start wearing a new pair (which &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/08/25/my-eighth-time-doing-run-around-the-square-5k/&#34;&gt;I just ran a race in and Abby also&lt;/a&gt;, but will come up with a rotation system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reason-5-vibram-is-discontinuing-the-kso-trek-shoes-and-they-are-on-sale&#34;&gt;Reason 5: Vibram is discontinuing the KSO Trek shoes and they are on sale!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the unbelievable news: Vibram is discontinuing the KSO Trek, my favorite shoe!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a sale is going on right now: we picked up four pairs at a clearance price, and so can you &lt;a href=&#34;http://birthdayshoes.com/labor-day-minimalist-barefoot-sales&#34;&gt;before they disappear for good&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very sad that Vibram is discontinuing the shoe that I have happily put well over a thousand miles on trail running, hiking, and paddling. I hope that by stocking up, I will be able to enjoy the KSO Trek for several years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today Abby and I ran in the annual &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.runaroundthesquare.com/&#34;&gt;Run Around The Square 5K race&lt;/a&gt;. As usual at this time in late August, it was a warm day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This race is special because Run Around The Square was the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/06/06/i-celebrated-national-running-day-in-schenley-park-remembering-how-i-began-to-run-13-year-ago/&#34;&gt;first race I ever ran in my life&lt;/a&gt;, back in 2000, and because it is also the first race Abby ever ran &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/12/31/reflections-on-2011/&#34;&gt;(just last year, 2011)&lt;/a&gt;: so today was my 128th lifetime race (according to my race log I keep) and Abby&amp;rsquo;s 5th lifetime race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-goal-this-year&#34;&gt;My goal this year&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal for the race for this year was to run it faster than I did last year (which also would automatically mean running it faster than any year since six years ago, 2006).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My time from last year was 24:36, and I believed from my last timed interval workout, on Tuesday, that I could run 24:30 today at fastest, so there was little room for error. I had hoped months ago that I would be in shape to run considerably faster in Run Around The Square this year, but travel and other interruptions caused me to train only haphazardly for races this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I achieve my goal? The story turns out to be more complicated than I expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-race&#34;&gt;The race&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;first-mile&#34;&gt;First mile&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took care during the first mile of the race not to go out too fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all passed by a lot of musicians on the streets, of course: a really fun tradition that goes way back. As I expected, I saw &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/12/18/fun-at-the-east-end-food-co-op-winterfest/&#34;&gt;Kimberlee Faught&lt;/a&gt; playing violin at one point:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/85802484@N06/7857971836&#34; title=&#34;&amp;quot;Run Around the Square&amp;quot;, Regent Square by sherpes39, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8286/7857971836_496cf2afe7.jpg&#34; width=&#34;375&#34; height=&#34;500&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;Run Around the Square&amp;quot;, Regent Square&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, I ignored all the champagne and beer stops on the race course. That&amp;rsquo;s a charming and venerable tradition at this race, but drinking alcohol would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; help me run as fast as I can!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;second-mile&#34;&gt;Second mile&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once in the trails of Frick Park, there is no longer any question of going too fast; there is only a question of avoiding going too slow. The uphill is really tough. And I&amp;rsquo;m much better running downhill than running uphill. During the second mile, my only thought is to maintain my effort level rather than my pace, because when the big downhill comes at the end of the race, I need to have enough energy in the tank to blast downhill, however crappy I might already be feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, that&amp;rsquo;s false: my other thought is to keep hydrated and cool. I sacrifice a little bit of time during the second mile because up near the tennis courts, I always grab a cup of water from a friendly volunteer and drink some of it while pouring the rest of it over my head and rubbing it through my hair and onto my face and neck. (I don&amp;rsquo;t take any more water after this point in the race.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, about halfway through the race, with more than ten minutes projected to go, I was feeling pretty pukey and my breathing getting harder. &lt;strong&gt;Good&lt;/strong&gt;; that&amp;rsquo;s just a sign that I&amp;rsquo;m following my 5K race game plan. It is impossible to &lt;em&gt;race&lt;/em&gt; a 5K without feeling pukey, whatever your level is. &lt;strong&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not feeling pukey by the middle of a 5K race, you&amp;rsquo;re not running the race as fast as you&amp;rsquo;re physically capable of running it.&lt;/strong&gt; I realize that many people run just for fun and don&amp;rsquo;t want or need to feel pukey in order to enjoy a race, and there have been races in which I have not gone all out, normally, I run a race in order to test my limits of existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;third-mile&#34;&gt;Third mile&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third mile, there&amp;rsquo;s the big downhill on the trail. The tricky thing is how to pass a lot of people. The problem with large trail races is that there are a lot of people who go out too fast early on or are much worse at running downhill than at running uphill; the result is congestion during the downhill parts of the course. I did manage to run downhill well without losing too much in efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;final-sprint&#34;&gt;Final sprint&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My vision was getting fuzzy from the pain, and my mind confused, when I was approaching the finish line. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell from the big clock whether I had already missed my chance at beating last year&amp;rsquo;s time. Seriously. It was reading 24:3x as far as I could tell, which meant that I already lost my chance to run 24:30. But was I going to beat 24:36? I had no idea. I thought I was going to see the &amp;ldquo;3&amp;rdquo; digit move to &amp;ldquo;4&amp;rdquo; at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of me wanted to shut down and quit and just watch the &amp;ldquo;4&amp;rdquo; digit arrive on the clock. Part of me knew that I still had enough energy to push harder, even as I was already sprinting, for another second or two (or more?!). Reality became distorted, I lost confidence, and I finished the race &lt;em&gt;not knowing whether I had really tried my best at the end&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;after-the-race&#34;&gt;After the race&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked my watch after I finished the race and didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to think. Did I succeed or fail at my time goal? My watch made it look like I finished in 24:40, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t confident that I hit the &amp;ldquo;start&amp;rdquo; at the right time, and I was even less confident that I hit &amp;ldquo;stop&amp;rdquo; right after crossing the finish line (I was guessing that I didn&amp;rsquo;t hit the button until a second or two after actually finishing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Abby finished, I kept telling her I was upset that I didn&amp;rsquo;t think I really went all out in the final minute of the race. Then I got over my disappointment and let it go; in the grand scheme of life it hardly matters!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-comments-about-the-race&#34;&gt;More comments about the race&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby was initially confused that everyone got a medal for the race. It was to commemorate the 30th anniversary of this race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, there were refreshments and snacks after the race provided by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.runaroundthesquare.com/#!sponsors&#34;&gt;many generous sponsors&lt;/a&gt;, and hot dogs and beer (I chose not to take any beer this year). I bumped into a lot of people I knew and met some friends of friends. One of them turned out to be someone who is apparently a friend of two completely different Pittsburgh friends I have. He took photos of Abby and me wearing our Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek shoes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/85802484@N06/7858001266/&#34; title=&#34;&amp;quot;Run Around the Square&amp;quot;, Regent Square by sherpes39, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7253/7858001266_58020e37f8_z.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;Run Around the Square&amp;quot;, Regent Square&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby likes this race because much of it is on the trails of Frick Park and we end in Fern Hollow, where there is a lot of greenery, nature at work (as opposed to some races we&amp;rsquo;ve done, which have been pure road races that end in some parking lot). Whenever I hear positive comments about this area, I am reminded of how long it took to redesign and restore Fern Hollow such that it is &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/15/snapshots-of-pittsburgh-from-a-12-mile-run/&#34;&gt;one of the real pleasures for me when I run in Frick Park&lt;/a&gt;. Ironically, I do remember the early days of Run Around The Square, which did end in Fern Hollow when it wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite as nice as it is now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, we appreciate the new moisture-wicking T-shirts given to those who registered. These shirts are much more practical and useful than the old cotton T-shirts. I&amp;rsquo;ll be happily wearing around the new Run Around The Square T-shirt when getting sweaty in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-did-i-in-fact-achieve-my-time-goal&#34;&gt;So did I in fact achieve my time goal?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know what really happened until many hours after the race when I saw the race results online: apparently my clock time was in fact 24:39.55, so I did finish before the &amp;ldquo;4&amp;rdquo; digit came to view. And my chip time (which is the one I consider my &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; time) was 24:35.6, nipping last year&amp;rsquo;s chip time of 24:36. I did it!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;goal-for-next-year&#34;&gt;Goal for next year?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what goal to set for next year. I suppose I could set a goal of getting yet faster, breaking 24:15. That sounds reasonable to me. Going back down to 24:00 may even be possible. It&amp;rsquo;s too early right now to tell. But one thing is for sure: I have no intention of slowing down from this year to next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run Around The Square is a really fun community event and 5K race in Pittsburgh that I try to run every year when I can. It was my first race ever and this year&amp;rsquo;s was my 128th race, and it was Abby&amp;rsquo;s first race. Running a race for so many years allows me to appreciate its quirks, track the state of my fitness, and experience its evolution as an event. I&amp;rsquo;m very thankful for this long-running tradition that just celebrated its 30th anniversary with the help of the Regent Square community and all the sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Tonight I was really excited to race in, and also watch, the inaugural &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.libertymile.org/&#34;&gt;GNC Live Well Liberty Mile&lt;/a&gt;, a road race that runs along Liberty Avenue in Pittsburgh, starting from the Strip District and ending downtown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s about time Pittsburgh had a road mile race! Pittsburgh already has the wonderful&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://rungreatrace.com/&#34;&gt;Great Race&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/09/25/blistered-but-blissful-in-the-burgh/&#34;&gt;I ran for my ninth time last year&lt;/a&gt; and will run for my tenth time this year (good think I pre-registered early, because today it &lt;a href=&#34;http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2012/08/17/2012-great-race-officially-sold-out/&#34;&gt;already sold out!!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pittsburghmarathon.com/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Marathon&lt;/a&gt;, which I&amp;rsquo;ve run once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this event is here to stay. Here&amp;rsquo;s my report on the event as both a runner and a spectator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-history-in-the-mile&#34;&gt;My history in the mile&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve run a mile race only twice before in my life, and that was on the track at Carnegie Mellon University. A decade ago, in June 2002, I ran in my first track mile, the Pittsylvania Mile on that track, and did it in 6:22. I could have run faster, but because of total inexperience, went out way too fast for the first quarter, doing it in 1:22, and paying the price in the other laps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following year, 2003, in probably my peak condition in my life, I improved, doing the Pittsylvania Mile in 6:10. I still went out too fast, in 1:26, had no sense of rhythm, slowed down a lot to try to compensate for going out too fast, then had too much energy at the end, which was wasted. Again, I had not trained for the mile distance at all, but happened to be in my peak condition anyway just because I was still conditioned from my intense training for the Pittsburgh Marathon that I had just done in May (my lifetime personal best in the 5K of 20:37 was achieved just two weeks after the Pittsburgh Marathon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I never broke a 6-minute mile during my peak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was the last timed mile I ever ran, until tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;preparation&#34;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t prepared for the mile at all. Apart from not having run much because of a non-running injury to my left leg that happened a month ago (from which I have fully recovered), I have just come back from a week of unexpected travel and am still kind of recovering from that. And no speed work to speak of in the past month, other than a few random sprints (which I do for general physical conditioning when I don&amp;rsquo;t do much else).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had no idea what &amp;ldquo;mile pace&amp;rdquo; feels like. I just figured I would run a bit faster than 5K pace (which I always have a reasonable feel for).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hoped to finish somewhere near 6:30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dr-vonda-wright&#34;&gt;Dr. Vonda Wright&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I bumped into &lt;a href=&#34;http://vondawright.com/&#34;&gt;Dr. Vonda Wright&lt;/a&gt; while heading toward the start line, and thanked her for her support of those of us who care about maintaining our health as we get older. I want to plug her great work in promoting lifetime fitness, especially for those over 40. She has written a book &lt;a href=&#34;http://vondawright.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=62&amp;amp;Itemid=83&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fitness After 40&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; which is pretty good and has a lot of scientifically-backed tips on remaining strong and vital and even reversing what used to be considered &amp;ldquo;normal aging&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard about Dr. Wright from a &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/01/20/cmu-fitness-challenge-keynote-lecture-by-vonda-wright-stay-strong-at-any-age/&#34;&gt;CMU &amp;ldquo;healthy campus week&amp;rdquo; talk she gave this January&lt;/a&gt;. Even though I had already known some of what she advocated, I was impressed that she summarized well the whole gamut of what we now know to be effective ways to increase strength and flexibility and avoid injury. Again, I recommend her books to anyone of any age who wants to be smart about diet and exercise and more than that, a whole philosophical approach to living in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-race-in-waves&#34;&gt;The race, in waves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The race was held in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.libertymile.org/Race-Waves.asp&#34;&gt;waves separated by ten or twenty minutes&lt;/a&gt;. This is obviously necessary because of the variation in people&amp;rsquo;s speed. The slower, open waves were held first, and the elite racers were in the final waves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;early-waves&#34;&gt;Early waves&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived to pick up my race number when the first wave was already in progress. There was a bit of confusion in the first two waves because a good number of people arrived late or were unclear about when to run, and therefore missed the first wave. Most of these seemed to be kids. By the way, it was great to see so many kids at the Liberty Mile. Running a 5K (3.1-mile) race can be daunting for a kid, but a single mile is surely a great introduction to many kids (and adults too!) to the joy of running. I think it is really great that the Liberty Mile is not just an elite race, but also a race anyone can participate in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-race-in-the-masters-wave&#34;&gt;My race, in the Masters wave&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Masters &amp;ldquo;Winning at 40+&amp;rdquo; wave was the first qualification-required wave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran in this serious, competitive wave, not one of the open waves, because I easily qualified to run in this wave, whose requirement was proof of ability to run an 8-minute mile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lining up, I saw a lot of really fit-looking people in this wave, many of whom were clearly well over 40. In any case, anyone who looked anywhere near my age (42) was obviously going to kick my butt all the way to the moon. There was no chance for an age-group prize for me today! No problem: as a non-elite racer, I don&amp;rsquo;t race for prizes, but just to do the best that I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up running &lt;a href=&#34;http://runhigh.com/2012RESULTS/R081712AD.html&#34;&gt;6:38.8&lt;/a&gt;, good for 26th place out of 27 in my age group, ha! I was disappointed that I didn&amp;rsquo;t make 6:30 as I had originally hoped when I signed up a month ago, but that&amp;rsquo;s OK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first quarter, I ran 1:29; oops, went out too fast yet again! &lt;strong&gt;I hereby pledge that before the next mile race I run, I will actually train and learn not to go out too fast.&lt;/strong&gt; There is no excuse for running three mile races going out too fast. I don&amp;rsquo;t go out too fast in 5K or longer distances, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second and third quarters, 1:46 and 1:46 showed that I had gone out too fast. I did save something for the sprint finish, however, and did the final quarter in 1:38.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A serious and unexpected problem I had while running this race was that my mouth got very dry and I had trouble breathing as a result. It was pretty weird. I don&amp;rsquo;t exactly remember this in my mile races from a decade ago. I did hydrate considerably before the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, of course, as I do in 5K races, I felt like puking during the final quarter, and my arms were getting tingly and losing sensation. It&amp;rsquo;s just what happens to me in the final push. I believe there is no way to avoid feeling like puking if I&amp;rsquo;m running as hard as I can, but I have a feeling that the problem with my arms has to do with my tightening up (rather than relaxing) and flailing around. I plan to try to fix that for my next races this month and next month; what is required, clearly, is disciplined speed work, which is something I have not done in years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;enjoying-being-a-spectator&#34;&gt;Enjoying being a spectator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The really cool thing about a mile race held in waves is that you get to be a spectator for the remaining waves after you&amp;rsquo;re done. In a 5K race or longer, there aren&amp;rsquo;t any heats and you never get to be a spectator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was wowed watching the &amp;ldquo;Unstoppable&amp;rdquo; under-40 wave whose qualification time was running faster than 6:00. Watching good, fast running is a real pleasure to me, like watching skilled dancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also a treat was getting to watch the female elite wave and male elite wave. These &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/07/27/why-i-do-not-watch-the-olympics-any-more/&#34;&gt;Olympic&lt;/a&gt;-caliber runners looked so elegant with their long, powerful strides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-shoes&#34;&gt;My shoes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d been considering running a race soon wearing my &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/07/26/walking-and-running-in-invisible-shoes-a-review/&#34;&gt;Invisible Shoes huaraches&lt;/a&gt;, but without testing them out with speed work, I&amp;rsquo;m not ready to go there yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I wore the shoes I&amp;rsquo;ve been &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/09/23/happiness-is-finishing-39th-of-43-men-in-a-race/&#34;&gt;road racing in for almost a full year now&lt;/a&gt;, the Vibram FiveFingers Bikila LS. They worked out just fine. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get blistered because it was cool and it was only a mile. Next month I&amp;rsquo;ll see whether I get blistered in the Great Race &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/09/25/blistered-but-blissful-in-the-burgh/&#34;&gt;the way I did last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;race-organization&#34;&gt;Race organization&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought the race was pretty well-organized, especially given that this was the first time such a race has been held in Pittsburgh. Thanks go to the sponsors, the timers, the announcers, the volunteers who handed out race numbers and stocked water and bagels at the finish line and handed out goodie bags and T-shirts, the police officers who closed the roads and lanes where necessary and directed traffic and kept Liberty Avenue clear, the spectators who cheered, the providers of the many port-a-johns near the start line, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://bringbackthemile.com/news/detail/Miller_and_Kampf_Win_GNC_Live_Well_Liberty_Mile&#34;&gt;elite runners who put on a display of amazing running&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone without question was helpful and friendly. The whole experience was just wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inaugural GNC Live Well Liberty Mile was a great event. I hope it is the beginning of a Pittsburgh tradition that, like the Great Race and the Pittsburgh Marathon, will continue for years and decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-of-2013-08-09&#34;&gt;(Update of 2013-08-09)&lt;/h3&gt;

      <title>Walking and running in Invisible Shoes: a review of the Connect</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For three weeks now, I have been wearing a pair of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.invisibleshoe.com/&#34;&gt;Invisible Shoes&lt;/a&gt; huaraches almost exclusively when walking and running outside. I have worn them daily walking, and I have run in them on roads, on sidewalks, on grass, and in park trails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a review of the 4mm sole Connect model (I might get a 6mm sole Contact later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what the shoes look like with &amp;ldquo;slip-on/slip-off&amp;rdquo; lacing:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/invisible-shoes-connect/without-feet.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/invisible-shoes-connect/bottom.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the sole is quite thin, just 4mm:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/invisible-shoes-connect/side-view.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here are some photos of me wearing the shoes:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/invisible-shoes-connect/grass.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/invisible-shoes-connect/asphalt.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-wear-such-a-thin-shoe&#34;&gt;Why wear such a thin shoe?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, in 2002, I learned about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarahumara_people&#34;&gt;Tarahumara&lt;/a&gt; Native Americans who live in Mexico and are famed for long-distance running. I was fascinated that they chose to run in minimalist huaraches. At the time, I was doing a lot of serious &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/running/&#34;&gt;running&lt;/a&gt;, and perpetually had problems with running shoes. I figured out from trial and error that the more minimalist I got, the more I enjoyed the feel of running and the fewer injuries I received, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how minimalist I could really get before the cons outweighed the pros. By 2002, I had gotten as far as wearing racing flats by New Balance and Asics for races and some of my training runs, but no shoe was perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had also tried wearing a variety of ordinary sandals for walking and running, but they had all kinds of ergonomic problems that led me to give up on them. The strapping systems, the substantial (by my standards) heels, and the curved &amp;ldquo;arch support&amp;rdquo; all caused discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to 2009, when I bought my first pair of Vibram FiveFingers minimalist shoes. These changed my life, being sufficiently minimalist to defeat a number of problems I&amp;rsquo;ve had with traditional mono-toed shoes. As long-time readers of &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/fivefingers/&#34;&gt;this blog know&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve been wearing them exclusively for all kinds of activities, ranging from regular everyday walking to running on roads, running on trails, hiking, kayaking, rafting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past year, I have tried a little bit of &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/barefoot-running/&#34;&gt;barefoot running&lt;/a&gt;, but that is still too extreme for me to do often or for a long period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I decided that now was the time to try to get more minimalist than FiveFingers, toward the &amp;ldquo;barefoot&amp;rdquo; feel, but without the most glaring drawbacks of being barefoot. Luckily, the surprising popularity of &lt;a href=&#34;http://chrismcdougall.com/&#34;&gt;Chris McDougall&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; book &amp;ldquo;Born to Run&amp;rdquo; has resulted in a good number of people selling minimalist huaraches for running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;buying&#34;&gt;Buying&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barefoot Ted had long sold his version of huaraches, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lunasandals.com/&#34;&gt;Luna Sandals&lt;/a&gt;. I decided to try, instead, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.invisibleshoe.com/&#34;&gt;Invisible Shoes&lt;/a&gt;, because these are more minimalist than the Luna, which in its classic form has a 6mm sole as well as a foot bed. I may well try the Luna at some point, but my goal for now is to approximate the barefoot feel, rather than pick the best huaraches for serious rugged use, and work up from there. So I went for the 4mm Connect version of the Invisible Shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, instead of buying a DIY kit, I decided that the simplest hassle-free way to break into huaraches was to buy a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lunasandals.com/&#34;&gt;custom-made&lt;/a&gt; shoe that had the soles cut and punched and laced up, ready to immediately wear. I traced my foot, scanned the trace, and emailed it, and quickly received my pair in the mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in trying out huaraches, I recommend following this route if the thought of DIY problems might otherwise discourage you. I may go DIY in the future, now that I see the final product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tying&#34;&gt;Tying&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of how to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.invisibleshoe.com/tying/&#34;&gt;tie&lt;/a&gt; laces always pops up. For now, I have not experimented with different methods in order to evaluate what works best for me for secureness and comfort. I have been using the slip-on/slip-off system that came with the shoe, adjusting it as needed when my foot feels too tight or too loose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;walking&#34;&gt;Walking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I got Invisible Shoes, my regular walking shoes were my Vibram FiveFingers KSO shoes. But once I got the Invisible Shoes, I completely stopped wearing the KSO for everyday walking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;pros&#34;&gt;Pros&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My toes have real freedom. Toe shoes like the Vibram FiveFingers compartmentalize the toes, so although they solve my wide-foot problem, they do not give me total freedom of the whole front of the foot that I like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good ventilation, like being barefoot. FiveFingers get hot in summer, resulting in sweat and sometimes blisters. I don&amp;rsquo;t get blisters walking in Invisible Shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the slip-on/slip-off system, I really can slip on and off easily. Since I like going barefoot indoors, it&amp;rsquo;s a plus to be able to slip on and off the shoes so easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cons&#34;&gt;Cons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is some rubbing at key points on the foot: the knot in the lacing system on top of the foot, and the lacing that passes between the big toe and the second toe. In practice, none of this has been a real problem except when it&amp;rsquo;s raining and my feet get wet, in which case I get chafed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The soles, being so thin, flop around a bit. Occasionally a sole will fold under and cause me to trip, but this happens very rarely. The main problem is mostly social: the flopping sound draws attention; I prefer to walk very silently (which I can do in most closed shoes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thinness of the soles also result in my feet getting very hot when I&amp;rsquo;m just standing for a period of time on hot asphalt or concrete (this is the same problem as I have when going barefoot). So standing at a street intersection waiting for a long light or in a parking lot while putting stuff into a car is not so pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thinness of the soles means walking over rough terrain is not always pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that all the problems with the thinness of the soles might not be present if I had the 6mm sole rather than the 4mm sole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;running&#34;&gt;Running&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I have run only four or five times in these shoes so far, so I will accumulate more experience as I continue to run in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;pros-1&#34;&gt;Pros&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running in these shoes on the roads and sidewalks is predictable and pleasant, very much like running barefoot. I am considering doing more tests to determine whether to run a road race 5K or 10K in these shoes! I have not run at race pace in these shoes yet. I may need to adjust lacing systems in order to feel confident about running at maximum speed without a flopping or lace-loosening problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cons-1&#34;&gt;Cons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is sole flopping when running. Actually there is less flopping than when walking, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running in the trails has not worked too smoothly. The 4mm sole really is quite thin for trail running. I noticed this when running in Frick Park, where some of the trails are more rocky than others. I also noticed this even when running in &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/06/18/walking-the-scenic-route-through-schenley-park-to-work/&#34;&gt;Schenley Park on the Pretty Good Race course&lt;/a&gt;, where the downhill section had me periodically hitting rocks harder than comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the annoyance of stuff getting between the foot and the sole when running in the trails. Since I don&amp;rsquo;t like stopping, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to simply flex my foot to let the material slide back out during the next couple of strides, and this mostly works. But I got one blister during a run on the trails, possibly because of loose material that got between my foot and the sole that I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother completely shaking out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 4mm Connect model of Invisible Shoes is great for walking around in. For running, I need to do more tests to find out how they hold up in more demanding conditions of speed and terrain. I would also like to compare the 4mm Connect model with the 6mm Contact model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

May 26, 2012 was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.primalfootalliance.org/ydws/&#34;&gt;Your Day Without Shoes&lt;/a&gt;, which Abby and I tried to observe, even though we were in DC at my sister&amp;rsquo;s at the time, visiting our new &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/nephew/&#34;&gt;nephew&lt;/a&gt;, and therefore we were in an unfamiliar environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that although Abby did spend the day without shoes, I wore shoes once in the morning and then not again the rest of the day. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain why, and also describe my actual very first day without shoes (while being out and about), which was today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ok-so-why-barefoot&#34;&gt;OK, so why barefoot??&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some reasons I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with walking or running barefoot in the past year or two:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my long history of problems with shoes of all kinds, because they mostly don&amp;rsquo;t fit me well or rub me or cause me knee and other problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;curiosity, novelty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a varied and heightened sensory life experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;working out kinks in my body balance and movement form&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;moving well barefoot is good training for moving well in shoes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have an ideological reason for going barefoot. I am sympathetic to the idea that our feet work pretty well because of our evolutionary history, but I am not a primitivist. I am typing this at a computer, illuminated by light that is not coming from the sun or moon. I am a pragmatist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;your-day-without-shoes&#34;&gt;Your Day Without Shoes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-i-failed&#34;&gt;How I failed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the official &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.primalfootalliance.org/ydws/&#34;&gt;Your Day Without Shoes&lt;/a&gt;, I had hoped to do entirely without shoes, but in the end, I chickened out and wore my trusty Vibram FiveFingers KSO shoes in a morning errand driving my brother-in-law to a grocery store, Harris Teeter, to buy food for a &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/05/31/some-pretty-attacking-chess-at-a-party-last-weekend/&#34;&gt;barbecue we were going to have&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I have never been barefoot in a grocery store before, and certainly not in some unknown store I&amp;rsquo;ve never scoped out in advance, I felt it was too risky to cause possible &amp;ldquo;trouble&amp;rdquo; on a simple errand that we had to run. If there had been no time pressure and I had been alone (not inconveniencing my brother-in-law and indirectly, our party guests for the afternoon), maybe I would have given it a shot. Or maybe not, given that I have not gone barefoot in a grocery store at home in Pittsburgh yet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have repeatedly gotten in some trouble when attempting to be barefoot in public. I am not the kind of person who likes to deliberately cause confrontations; I realize, of course, that this makes me part of the problem, not speaking up. But I get not only words and looks of disapproval, but &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo;-looking people who make up painfully obvious made-up sermons about &amp;ldquo;laws&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;rules&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;health codes&amp;rdquo;. In principle, I could go out of my way to contact appropriate authorities in order to defend myself, but right now, not being a barefoot zealot but a novice experimenting, I have settled for experimenting where it is &amp;ldquo;safe&amp;rdquo; while building up my barefooting experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Safe&amp;rdquo; for me right now is roughly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anywhere outside a public building, such as on the streets, sidewalks, grass, parks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at work (while not being in a gym or library or other such place where &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; looking people go around telling people how to behave)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in my car&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at other people&amp;rsquo;s homes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a place I frequent where I basically know the people in charge and have inferred they&amp;rsquo;re OK with my being barefoot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;abby-and-i-experimented-with-going-barefoot-the-rest-of-the-day&#34;&gt;Abby and I experimented with going barefoot the rest of the day&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;eastern-market&#34;&gt;Eastern Market&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby and I did go barefoot later in the morning, after my grocery shopping errand, when we went to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.easternmarket-dc.org/&#34;&gt;Eastern Market&lt;/a&gt;, which was hustling and bustling on a Saturday. We were there to check out the outside action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it was very sunny and hot that day (I think the temperature was up to 90F!), and some of the outside brick and asphalt surfaces were burning hot, too hot to really walk on. We ended up looking for surfaces under shade, or painted white, to step on, but there were not many such surfaces. So we had to basically &amp;ldquo;run&amp;rdquo; in order to minimize foot contact with the ground. We didn&amp;rsquo;t last very long out there and headed back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was a rookie mistake to have made. Well, we learn by failing small. We&amp;rsquo;re no purists about barefooting, just curious and pragmatic experimenters. No more going barefoot again in such conditions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;evening-walk&#34;&gt;Evening walk&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a long day, cleaning up from the party, it was starting to get dark outside, and cooler, and Abby and I went out for a little walk in the neighborhood. So we went out barefoot, in keeping with the theme for the day. The walk was nice. Without the burning sun, the sidewalks and roads were just fine for walking on barefoot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby came up with the idea that when we went home, we should start doing some barefoot walking together after dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-very-first-day-out-without-shoes&#34;&gt;My very first day out without shoes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was my very first day out without shoes. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t intended on that, here&amp;rsquo;s what happened:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;yesterday&#34;&gt;Yesterday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I went for a &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/06/06/i-celebrated-national-running-day-in-schenley-park-remembering-how-i-began-to-run-13-year-ago/&#34;&gt;nice run for National Running Day&lt;/a&gt;. Usually when I run in the trails, I wear my Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek shoes, because they give me more protection and never blister me. But yesterday I wanted to experiment (yet again) with wearing the more truly minimalist KSO shoes, which, unfortunately, have had a history of blistering me badly because of the design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The run was great, and over the months I have adapted (thanks to periodic barefooting) to landing even more subtly and efficiently so that even with the KSO shoes, I do not find the rocks or tree roots out on the trail to be too uncomfortable to deal with. Unfortunately, I still got a blister at my usual rubbing spot at the side of my big toe joint. (You may be able to spot it in the photos below.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/national-running-day-vibram-fivefingers-kso.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin&amp;#39;s Vibram FiveFingers KSO shoes&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/national-running-day-barefoot.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin&amp;#39;s Vibram FiveFingers KSO shoes&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out yesterday that because of the blister, I just didn&amp;rsquo;t want to wear any shoes for the rest of the day, and in fact I didn&amp;rsquo;t. I went barefoot from the time I finished my run to the time I left work and drove home, and I was barefoot the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;today&#34;&gt;Today&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today my blister had subsided (it will probably be &amp;ldquo;OK&amp;rdquo; tomorrow), but I still did not feel like wearing shoes. So I went to work barefoot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it was sunny and the asphalt in the parking lot was very hot. I did what I could to ease my walk out of the parking lot to my office (basically, &amp;ldquo;run&amp;rdquo; when on hot surfaces), but frankly, it was not pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went home from work barefoot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then after dinner, I ran barefoot in Squirrel Hill from home to the monthly meeting of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://pghrb.heroku.com/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Ruby&lt;/a&gt; group. Afterwards, I ran back home. So that was my day without shoes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little by little, I have expanded my barefooting experience, and plan to continue exploring. I find it very enjoyable and surprising that after more than a year, I am no longer very uncomfortable walking on typical city sidewalks and roads (unless there is hot direct sun involved with darker surfaces).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>International Barefoot Running Day 2012: my second year of celebration and my first barefoot trail run</title>

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One year ago (May 1, 2011), I celebrated the first annual &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thebarefootrunners.org/pages/IBRD/&#34;&gt;International Barefoot Running Day&lt;/a&gt; by running 0.6 mile on the streets of my neighborhood. That was the very first time in my life I was &amp;ldquo;brave&amp;rdquo; enough to &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/barefoot-running/&#34;&gt;run barefoot&lt;/a&gt; outside (other than one failed attempt I discuss below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I pushed the envelope by running a full 2 miles barefoot, including a 0.5 mile trail loop on Frick Park. &lt;strong&gt;This was my first time ever running barefoot on the trails.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/international-barefoot-running-day-2012/barefoot.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;My two feet&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/international-barefoot-running-day-2012/barefoot-soles.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Soles of my two feet after barefoot run&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the story of why I got into barefoot running, and what progress I&amp;rsquo;ve made in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-first-barefoot-run-outside&#34;&gt;My first barefoot run outside&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to start with my first barefoot run outside. This happened in summer 2002, on the track at Carnegie Mellon University. I did only one lap. I did this as an experiment as I was learning from trial and error that running with lighter shoes seemed to feel better for me, and decreased injuries to my knees and shins, in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to understand, this happened a decade ago, well before minimalist and barefoot running became much more widespread, through &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chrismcdougall.com/&#34;&gt;Chris McDougall&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s bestselling book, &lt;em&gt;Born to Run&lt;/em&gt;, that came out in 2009 (I read the book in May 2009 and highly recommend it to &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; runners!). At the time, my experiments as a runner had led me in the following progression of shoes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;heavy &amp;ldquo;motion control&amp;rdquo; shoes (because I overpronated so much initially as an overweight non-runner)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lighter &amp;ldquo;neutral&amp;rdquo; shoes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;lightweight trainer&amp;rdquo; shoes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;racing flats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of really running barefoot never occurred to me, but I wanted to experiment with simply doing a bit of controlled training (on the predictable surface of a track) barefoot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few attempts, I gave up. I suffered from&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blistered feet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;very sore Achilles tendons and calves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shin splits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for almost a decade, I simply never tried running barefoot again, even on a track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;transition-to-vibram-fivefingers-shoes&#34;&gt;Transition to Vibram FiveFingers shoes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have raved repeatedly on this blog about my use of &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/fivefingers/&#34;&gt;Vibram FiveFingers&lt;/a&gt; minimalist shoes. They are my regular shoes now (when not in winter) for running (road and trail), street walking, trail hiking. They came to my attention through a friend in 2009, and in conjunction with my reading McDougall&amp;rsquo;s book, I bought my first pair of FiveFingers shoes in fall of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me two years of occasional use to really build up distance with the minimalist shoes and change my form in many ways such that I no longer experience any undue pain on stress on my muscles or joints. By 2011, I was ready to use them as my everyday footwear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-next-step-barefoot&#34;&gt;The next step: barefoot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the idea of barefoot running kept on haunting me. The difference between running in even minimalist shoes and barefoot is vast. I experienced a lot of fears:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fear of possible injury to the skin from rocks, glass, other objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fear possible hygiene issues (what am I stepping on?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fear of sheer skin sensitivity and pain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past year, since my tiny experiment on May 1, 2011, I have been doing small amounts of outdoors barefoot walking and running, mostly in the context of walking or running home 2 miles from work, and going barefoot at the office (I have always gone barefoot indoors at home, since I grew up under the Asian custom of leaving shoes at the door). Over time, I have addressed my fears to some extent:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have learned to visually scan the surface I am running on, to avoid obvious hazards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have learned to accept that heck, will I really get hurt from stepping on a surface that might have some tiny amount (which I can&amp;rsquo;t even see) of dried spit, insect parts, or dog poo?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have become more efficient and less fearful of the sensations of landing on patches of rough concrete, twigs, debris, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have grown to be fairly comfortable walking or running on concrete and asphalt, where the surfaces are mostly predictable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-final-frontier-barefoot-trail-running&#34;&gt;The final frontier: barefoot trail running&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my experiments last year of even walking off the road and grass onto the trails of Frick Park had me whimpering after a few seconds, feeling totally unready to seriously walk or run on the trails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Until today.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In honor of the second annual &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thebarefootrunners.org/pages/IBRD/&#34;&gt;International Barefoot Running Day&lt;/a&gt;, I went for a 2 mile barefoot run today that included a 0.5 mile trail loop. The soles of my feet suffered a bit, but I actually managed to do this run without screaming or giving up. I came home with some hot spots on my soles, but nothing much worse than when I run 2 miles just on concrete and asphalt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year ago, I would not have believed that I would run a full half mile barefoot on the trails. But that was a year ago. A year ago, I would not have believed that I would be doing today many of the things that I have only begun doing last year (such as writing my own blog, playing music, programming in JavaScript). Things change. And all that is required is to take one small step at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-next&#34;&gt;What next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still cannot imagine running barefoot for more than half a mile, or on much more difficult terrain than the one trail section in Frick Park. We&amp;rsquo;ll see what I have to report next year for the third International Barefoot Running Day!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;John, Abby, and I went on a strenuous &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/pittsburghhikers/events/55247792&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Hiking meetup hike in PA State Game Land 51 (Dunbar)&lt;/a&gt;. It was over 10 miles and quite exploratory. There were large ascents and descents and bushwhacking, rocks, mud, waterfalls, getting &amp;ldquo;lost&amp;rdquo;, finding the way back. Fun, but wow, totally exhausted afterwards!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting off on the road:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/pa-state-game-land-51/road.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;cool-rocks&#34;&gt;Cool rocks&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/pa-state-game-land-51/weird-rocks.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/pa-state-game-land-51/more-rocks.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/pa-state-game-land-51/rock-slope-and-view.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is cool: holes in rock:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/pa-state-game-land-51/holes-in-rock.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some unmelted ice!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/pa-state-game-land-51/unmelted-ice.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;miscellaneous&#34;&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bug &amp;ldquo;hitchhiking&amp;rdquo; on my Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek shoes:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/pa-state-game-land-51/hitchhiking-bug.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Cool view from where we are up here:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/pa-state-game-land-51/view-from-up.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Uh, we seem &amp;ldquo;lost&amp;rdquo;, but we do have maps:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/pa-state-game-land-51/looking-at-map.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;lunch-break&#34;&gt;Lunch break&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby made these really cute seasoned chicken/veggie lettuce wraps for our lunch!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/pa-state-game-land-51/chicken-lettuce-wrap.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Our hike leaders Jeff and Terri enjoying lunch:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/pa-state-game-land-51/jeff-terri-lunch.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Everyone is hungry!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/pa-state-game-land-51/lunch-others.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Abby also made shrimp and seaweed wraps:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/pa-state-game-land-51/shrimp-seaweed-wrap.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What happened to this leaf?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/pa-state-game-land-51/leaf.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Going down:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/pa-state-game-land-51/bushwhacking-down.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard going down when it&amp;rsquo;s also sideways:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/pa-state-game-land-51/bushwhacking-side-down.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;down-to-the-waterfall&#34;&gt;Down to the waterfall&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was exciting seeing the waterfall down there. Probably very few people have gone there because there is no direct route, only the hard way as we did:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/pa-state-game-land-51/down-to-waterfall.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/pa-state-game-land-51/waterfall.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/pa-state-game-land-51/waterfall-close.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/SFILv9C8k48&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going back up:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/pa-state-game-land-51/bushwhacking-up.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;found-a-way-back&#34;&gt;Found a way back!!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rhododenrons, all of a sudden:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/pa-state-game-land-51/rhododendrons.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Going through them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/I6XiJegg2KQ&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, amazingly, a narrow passageway between rocks!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/pa-state-game-land-51/passageway.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally, a view of our cars!!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/pa-state-game-land-51/cars.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very tough hike, not the kind Abby and I would normally do every weekend, but it&amp;rsquo;s really special to have people like Jeff and Terri lead us through this kind of terrain, and for all of us to be surprised by what we find.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My God It&#39;s Full of Stairs! Pittsburgh Step Trek 2011</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/10/08/my-god-its-full-of-stairs-pittsburgh-step-trek-2011/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2011 17:50:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/10/08/my-god-its-full-of-stairs-pittsburgh-step-trek-2011/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was a beautiful, sunny, warm day, as promised earlier by the weather forecasts.  Abby and I did the 11th annual &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.southsideslopes.org/steptrek&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Step Trek&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. I wish I&amp;rsquo;d known about this event in earlier years! It was a truly unique event, an urban hike of the Pittsburgh &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wqed.org/tv/sebak/neighborhoods/so_side.php&#34;&gt;South Side Slopes&lt;/a&gt;, with all its many staircases, zig-zagging streets, historic buildings, and great views of the city.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-stairs-down.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;?&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We did about six miles of fantastic sightseeing (and got a pretty good workout while at it):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived at the registration area in South Side Park, and immediately, people started asking about the &lt;a href=&#34;www.vibramfivefingers.com/&#34;&gt;Vibram FiveFingers&lt;/a&gt; shoes that Abby and I were wearing: Abby was wearing her &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/products/Five-Fingers-Sprint-Womens.htm&#34;&gt;Sprint&lt;/a&gt; and I was wearing my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/products/Five-Fingers-KSO-Mens.htm&#34;&gt;KSO&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout the Step Trek we would get asked about them by many other curious trekkers! We always got the same kinds of questions: &amp;ldquo;Are they comfortable?&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Do they provide enough protection/support?&amp;rdquo; The answer is yes, they are pretty comfortable, and yes, they are sufficiently protective and supportive, if you learn to walk more carefully, and develop your foot and leg muscles; and there are different models we use for different terrains and activities.  For example, I have mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/09/23/happiness-is-finishing-39th-of-43-men-in-a-race/&#34;&gt;in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/09/25/blistered-but-blissful-in-the-burgh/&#34;&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/01/run-shadyside-5k-outrunning-mickey-mouse-and-lending-a-trumpet/&#34;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; my running on the roads in Bikila LS, and running and hiking off road in KSO Trek shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we checked in with our tickets (pre-registered earlier) and were given a booklet for the self-guided tour for the Step Trek, we started our trek. There were two looping routes outlined, the Black route (3.02 miles, with 1,250 steps) and the Gold route (2.89 miles, with 1,222 steps). We decided to do one route first and then the other immediately following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started off with the Gold route, entering South Side Park and immediately taking the 72 serpentine steps up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;photos&#34;&gt;Photos&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is just a minuscule sample of what else we saw. You&amp;rsquo;d have to do the Step Trek to experience it yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a nice view of Pittsburgh during the trek:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Nice view of Pittsburgh&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s another one:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-view-of-pittsburgh-2.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Another nice view of Pittsburgh&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_street&#34;&gt;paper street&lt;/a&gt;, Caesar Way, which is actually a staircase rather than an actual street! Pittsburgh has a number of these I have encountered before.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Caesar Way (paper street)&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A typical staircase leading connecting areas of different elevation:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;A staircase&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A beautiful view while descending on a road. The old St. Josaphat church is visible down the road:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the bi-level streets we saw, with fencing separating the two levels:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Me just enjoying a little break at the Eleanor Street parklet:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;done&#34;&gt;Done&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we returned from finishing both the Gold and Black routes, we enjoyed watermelon slices, oranges, and bananas. Because it was so sunny, we were both slightly sunburned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier, we enjoyed the official rest stops that provided beverages, bite-sized candy bars, and port-a-johns. A very nicely organized event, with clear signs posted periodically along the routes and friendly crossing guards at fast-moving roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing we particular enjoyed after finishing was looking at the gallery of historic photos in one of the tents. It was eerie seeing those black and white photos of streets we had walked that were once dirt roads for horses, construction of bridges and staircases, old homes that are still standing now (and renovated). I wish there were more of the before/after photos. Maybe decades from now we&amp;rsquo;ll see YouTube time-lapse videos of how things are now in our neighborhoods and how things will be then!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-of-2012-10-06&#34;&gt;(Update of 2012-10-06)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following year, sadly, I did not do the Pittsburgh Step Trek again, because of a schedule conflict with &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/10/06/the-fineview-stepathon-2012-pittsburghs-grueling-urban-trail-race/&#34;&gt;the Fineview Stepathon that I did instead&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;ll have to see what the schedules are for 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-of-2013-9-25&#34;&gt;(Update of 2013-9-25)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, because of schedule conflicts again, Abby and I will not able to attend Step Trek. It seems that everything in Pittsburgh happens on the weekend of Step Trek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I attended a special preview tour that enabled me to &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/09/25/why-you-should-go-out-to-the-pittsburgh-south-side-slopes-step-trek/&#34;&gt;catch up on changes and also promote the event&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Run Shadyside 5K: Outrunning Mickey Mouse and Lending a Trumpet</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/10/01/run-shadyside-5k-outrunning-mickey-mouse-and-lending-a-trumpet/</link>

      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/10/01/run-shadyside-5k-outrunning-mickey-mouse-and-lending-a-trumpet/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My alarm starts blaring at 6:30 AM on a cold, dark Saturday morning, and I&amp;rsquo;m tired and sleepy, and briefly wonder why I preregistered on Wednesday to run today&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.runshadyside.com/&#34;&gt;Run Shadyside 5K&lt;/a&gt; race. But a commitment is a commitment, so I get, check the weather forecast, get dressed, eat something, and head off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little do I know that today I will just manage to outrun Mickey Mouse, far exceed my race time goal, and lend someone my trumpet that has been lying around unused!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/franklin-and-mickey-mouse-eric.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin and Eric after the race&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;pre-race&#34;&gt;Pre-race&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it was cold, in the 40s, and there was a possibility it could rain (although things looked clear), I wore a long-sleeve shirt and gloves and a hat along with my shorts and Bikila LS shoes (this was the third race in which I used these shoes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my successful &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/09/25/blistered-but-blissful-in-the-burgh/&#34;&gt;Great Race 10K&lt;/a&gt; toughened me up, I was ready to run a &amp;ldquo;fast&amp;rdquo; 5K race. I had run a 5K in August in 24:36, and another in September in 24:36, but these were mostly off-road and hilly, so I expected that I should definitely go under 24:00 in this mostly flat road race, I targeted 23:30 as an ambitious goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing you have to realize is that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t run a decent 5K in years, so my goal was to really gut it out in this one. My fastest 5K was in 2003, in 20:37. I slowed down gradually to 22:04 in 2007, but later in 2007, as my life entered turmoil, I slowed to 23:30, then 24:39 in 2008, 25:20 in 2009, and 26:41 in 2010. So I have been using races this year as a gauge of my gradual &amp;ldquo;comeback&amp;rdquo; to my former level of fitness (taking aging into account, of course).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-race&#34;&gt;The race&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/QslAbd-_TsA&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gun went off and the race played out for me as most largish races do: I took care not to go out too fast, but a lot of people always act otherwise and pass me like crazy during the first minutes of the race. I just &lt;a href=&#34;http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/09/run-your-own-race.html&#34;&gt;run my own race&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a mile, things were mostly settled down. I noticed a guy ahead of me wearing a hat with Mickey Mouse ears.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/mickey-mouse-ears-hat-profile.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Mickey Mouse ears hat&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the gap between the guy and me was ever so slowly increasing. I decided at that moment that with two miles to go, I was going to do what I could to beat this guy. This goal was going to be the single purpose of my life for the next 15 minutes (approximately).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To motivate myself even further, I used the mind trick of publicly proclaiming my goal. I know this technique is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_keep_your_goals_to_yourself.html&#34;&gt;controversial&lt;/a&gt; and can backfire, but I think it depends on context. Every time I found myself running side by side with someone (whether someone I was passing or someone who had caught up to me), I told him that I was going to catch Mickey Mouse. Somehow saying that always gave me a bit of energy each time, and I would pass the guy I just talked with and not look back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I pushed really hard but for the whole second mile had still not yet closed the gap with Mickey Mouse. Sometimes I could not even see him, but I always made sure to find him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around halfway through the third mile, I started closing on Mickey Mouse. For the first time in the race, I was totally confident that I had what it took to beat him. I finally overtook him when the finish line was in sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;final-sprint&#34;&gt;Final sprint&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that was not all. I saw the clock and was surprised to find that I was going to come in well under 23:00!  In the excitement, I decided to go wild.  I &lt;strong&gt;screamed&lt;/strong&gt;, as though I were dying, as I launched into a big sprint to pass probably a dozen people as I stumbled over the finish line in something like 22:46.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man, that was cathartic. This is only the second time I have ever screamed in a race (and I have run in well over a hundred in the past decade). I had let out a scream during a sprint finish at the Pretty Good Race 5K in September, but it was a short scream, not this prolonged seconds-long one that I let out today. I supposed that in the past decade I used to be too shy to do a thing like that, but it felt so good today that I may do it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was reminded of how in karate class I was instructed on how important it was to use the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiai&#34;&gt;kiai&lt;/a&gt; shout as a projection of energy. But then I reflected, my scream was not objectively the best way to end a race. If I had enough energy to scream, then I should have been able to run faster before that point, so a smarter race would have been to push even harder before the somewhat wasteful sprint. Nevertheless, at the very moment today, the scream seemed the thing to do, for psychological reasons, at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;post-race&#34;&gt;Post-race&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mickey Mouse came in seconds later. I went up to him and shook his hand, then grabbed some water and food and started walking back to my car (parked almost a mile away), since I needed to cool down from the race, and wanted to get my camera and warm clothing to bring back to the post-race party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back from my car, I saw Mickey Mouse, but without the ears. He was walking with his family and I approached him and had his mother take a photo of us. His name is &lt;a href=&#34;http://ericbrockmeyer.com/&#34;&gt;Eric&lt;/a&gt; and he said he wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only one with Mickey Mouse ears: a bunch of Disney Research people were all wearing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got back to the post-race party and happened to see a guy I know from lots of previous races in the past decade, Ron Romanoff, and had him take a photo of me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I saw a sign for pancakes, and suddenly realized that I had totally forgotten about the post-race pancake breakfast. I put away the half-eaten bagel I was munching on and headed toward the pancakes, and whom did I see but &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.communiteach.com/post/10818529188&#34;&gt;Ben Paul&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I had first met and talked with Ben at &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/09/22/starting-a-new-web-site/&#34;&gt;PodCamp Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;, although I had heard his name much earlier since he was one of the founders of &lt;a href=&#34;http://communiteach.com/&#34;&gt;CommuniTeach&lt;/a&gt;. CommuniTeach is a really great concept, providing a way for people who want to learn stuff, or teach it, or both, to get together. Back in June, Abby and I had attended a CommuniTeach session on &lt;a href=&#34;http://communiteach.com/learnitss.php?glid=151&#34;&gt;fermentation&lt;/a&gt;. We learned to make kefir and sauerkraut and experiment with various fermented veggie combinations involving radishes, carrots, zucchini, onion, fennel seeds, you name it. Since July (when our first batch was ready), we&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying tasty fermented veggies to complement our meals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are curious about teaching or learning anything in the Pittsburgh area, I highly recommend that you sign up on &lt;a href=&#34;http://communiteach.com/&#34;&gt;CommuniTeach&lt;/a&gt; and check it out! I also find the &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/#!/CommuniTeach&#34;&gt;@CommuniTeach&lt;/a&gt; very useful to follow, and there is also a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/pages/CommuniTeach/99389138220&#34;&gt;Facebook site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned to Ben that I&amp;rsquo;d been reading about him from the links that he&amp;rsquo;s posted. I&amp;rsquo;d just learned that he played melodica, and I said that I have a melodica too, but have not been playing it. I said I was also learning accordion recently. I asked him about ukulele, since he had mentioned it somewhere, and he suggested that a bunch of us find a way to teach ourselves together. I pointed out that unfortunately, I was already focusing a lot of my musical time on playing recorder and for now my ukulele goals are on hold. He couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe I played recorder, since he hates the sound, ha! I happened to mention that I had too many instruments I didn&amp;rsquo;t play, such as a trumpet. He got excited, because he needs a trumpet to play, and I offered to lend him mine. So we decided that he could meet up at my place to pick it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We looked at the posted race results and Ben couldn&amp;rsquo;t find himself listed. He was pretty bummed about that. It was his first race! It turned out that he had not attached the race chip to his shoe, but it was still attached to his race number on his shirt. Oops. Nevertheless, in case anyone ever doubts it: I hereby declare myself as a witness to Ben Paul having run his first race today in Shadyside!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;trumpet-finally-finds-a-happy-player&#34;&gt;Trumpet finally finds a happy player!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s Ben with my trumpet. Enjoy playing it, Ben!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/ben-paul-with-franklins-trumpet.jpg&#34; /&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;rain&#34;&gt;Rain&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started raining outside just as Ben left with the trumpet. I am &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; grateful that it did not rain during the race! I was prepared to deal with it (I have run cold half marathons during which it rained the whole time), but it would not have been so much fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-of-2012-10-06&#34;&gt;(Update of 2012-10-06)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following year, sadly, I did not do Run Shadyside again, because of a schedule conflict with &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/10/06/the-fineview-stepathon-2012-pittsburghs-grueling-urban-trail-race/&#34;&gt;the Fineview Stepathon that I did instead&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;ll have to see what the schedules are for 2013.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m temporarily using a walking stick right now, because of bad blisters I got on my right foot this morning. But I am very happy today, and it was a &lt;a href=&#34;http://rungreatrace.com/&#34;&gt;Great&lt;/a&gt; day in the &amp;lsquo;Burgh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have now run the Pittsburgh &lt;a href=&#34;http://rungreatrace.com/&#34;&gt;Great Race&lt;/a&gt; 10K nine times now, beginning in 2000: I have only missed 2003 (the year it was canceled), 2009, and 2010. I have run it in all kinds of conditions (both in terms of weather and my physical state). There is no other race I have run for so many years, so it is always special to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But beyond that, today&amp;rsquo;s race was special because Abby participated in it, for the first time. She did not run the 10K, but did run the 5K (and took the photo of me above nearing the finish line). She just started running in races with me this year, and I am very proud of her for getting into running! Having once been a non-runner, it gives me great pleasure to encourage others to take up this wonderful form of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Of course, right after catching my breath and finding Abby, my first instinct was to ask her, &amp;ldquo;Where are the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eatnpark.com/smiley.asp&#34;&gt;Smiley Cookies&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;rdquo; I limped over to pick one up, even as sweat was still dripping down my face, and eagerly gobbled it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tradition&#34;&gt;Tradition&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Great Race is a wonderful Pittsburgh tradition. It is not only thrilling to be on the Boulevard of the Allies heading downtown getting a fine view of our city (although the uphill during mile 5 of the race is admittedly tough), but the sight of so many people participating in this event is heartwarming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/great-race-2011-crowd.jpg&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-great-race-stats&#34;&gt;My Great Race stats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also very happy about my finish time. I had a plan to break 48:00 this year, and I succeeded handily (all times mentioned are &amp;ldquo;chip times&amp;rdquo;, not &amp;ldquo;gun times&amp;rdquo;). My time was, of course, not one of my fastest times in this race (my fastest time was 42:49 nine years ago), but it was faster than my time in 2008. The last three years of my life have been very tough for me physically, so I have enjoyed starting to get back into shape this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my record in the Great Race 10K over the years:

    &lt;td style=&#34;border: 1px solid black; padding: 3px&#34;&gt;Lightly trained, but put in a genuine effort on race day.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;details-of-the-race&#34;&gt;Details of the race&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My splits (for each mile, then the final 0.22 mile) are below. I tried to run an even effort (till the final mile, when I simply tried to keep going hard despite the pain), accounting for the changes in elevation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7:40.73&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7:07.52&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8:09.14&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7:23.90&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8:24.08&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7:29.08&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1:31.03&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One trick I try to use in a race is to pick someone ahead of me who is running just a bit faster than what I feel I can hold, and see if I can slowly catch up (and maybe overtake eventually). In the Great Race, this is hard to do because there are so many runners, and people starting at different times, so there is always a lot of passing and slowing down going on, unlike in smaller races where things get spread out and you know people are basically running at the pace they can hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to work harder in these big races to maintain my own sense of pace. I do this by &amp;ldquo;feel&amp;rdquo;: having run in races from a mile up to the marathon, I know what a sustainable pace feels like. 5K pace gives me a burning, pukey sensation, for example, while half-marathon pace is not at all pukey. 10K pace is in between: uncomfortable but tolerable, till the final mile when I just do whatever I can without completely falling apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;don-slusser&#34;&gt;Don Slusser&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it was after around two miles that I noticed ahead of me &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newsandsentinel.com/page/content.detail/id/538234.html&#34;&gt;Don Slusser&lt;/a&gt;, a local legend in the running scene. OK, he is not at all what he used to be, and has had a lot of knee surgeries, but still, I felt it was an honor to be see him out there still running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as Don was still ahead of me, he was going to be my target. He pulled away from me slightly over the next three miles, but was always in my sight. So in the final mile, I finally blasted past him. Then somehow he passed me at one point downtown, and that pushed me to pick up the pace again and finish ahead of him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After he finished, I went up to him and shook his hand. He probably has no idea who I am or why I respect him or how he helped provide focus for me in my own attempt to run as well as I could today, but what can I say, it was a spontaneous gesture on my part. I salute you, Don: you and your wife Tammy have done much for the Pittsburgh running community and I am grateful for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-note-on-shoes&#34;&gt;A note on shoes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the second race in which I&amp;rsquo;ve run in my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/products/Five-Fingers-BikilaLS-Mens.htm&#34;&gt;Bikila LS&lt;/a&gt; shoes (the first race was &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/09/23/happiness-is-finishing-39th-of-43-men-in-a-race/&#34;&gt;three days ago&lt;/a&gt;). Unfortunately, these shoes tend to give me blisters if I run over three miles and fast. I&amp;rsquo;ve run a slow eight miles before without blisters, but going fast, and in warm weather, my feet sweat and chafing happens. These shoes are nice but have a ventilation problem. I have never had any problems with my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/products/Five-Fingers-KSO-Trek-Mens.htm&#34;&gt;KSO Trek&lt;/a&gt; shoes that I use for trail running and hiking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see in the photo above that Abby wore her &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/products/five-fingers-komodo-sport-ls-mens.htm&#34;&gt;KomodoSport LS&lt;/a&gt; shoes in the race. Wearing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/&#34;&gt;Vibram FiveFingers&lt;/a&gt; shoes for walking, hiking, and running has really improved our lives. (More on that in a later blog post.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;photo-update-on-september-28-2011&#34;&gt;Photo update on September 28, 2011&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some official photos from Island Photography have appeared online. I have to confess that my original plan was to try to spot the cameras and try to look good for any photos of me that might be taken. Unfortunately, I was in such pain in the final mile of the race that I had tunnel vision and could not really perceive anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve added some of these photos to the beginning of this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Happiness Is: Finishing 39th of 43 Men in a Race!</title>

      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/09/23/happiness-is-finishing-39th-of-43-men-in-a-race/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, on a late, muggy afternoon, I ran in a race, and finished 39th of 43 men in the race. I ran as hard as I could, just as I do in every race: my goal is always to run fast and beat as many competitors as I can. I don&amp;rsquo;t run in a race for &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; (in the conventional sense of the word): I race to know pain and to stretch my limits. (I save my &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; running for when I&amp;rsquo;m not racing.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why was I pretty happy, despite getting my butt totally kicked?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For amusement, here is an excerpt of the men&amp;rsquo;s individual results of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cmu.edu/athletics/recreation/intramurals/activities.html&#34;&gt;CMU intramural&lt;/a&gt; XC race yesterday (billed as 2 miles but the course was clearly shorter than that): &lt;ol start=&#34;38&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;13:17.3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;13:27.7 (me)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;14:33.7&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;14:33.71&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;14:33.72&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;14:59.9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I was happy for a number of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one thing, this is the first &amp;ldquo;cross-country&amp;rdquo; race I have done, so I was just plain excited to do something different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, my expectations were low. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice.html&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Low expectations are the secret to happiness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I entered the race knowing there was a definite possibility that I would finish last. I knew many of the runners would be undergrads less than half my age, and a self-selected group too, a group that does not include the (sadly numerous) students I see around every day who take the bus down one or two blocks or take the elevator up one floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was one of those students once&lt;/em&gt;. I was not a runner as a child, or in high school, or in college, or even in graduate school. I was sickly as a child, and also I was raised to pay no attention to physical fitness and even to look down on those who were fit (I know, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sour_grapes&#34;&gt;sour grapes&lt;/a&gt;). I started running only after I left graduate school and embarked on several radical life changes (including losing 30 pounds, altering my diet, and taking up competitive ballroom dancing). So in a way, taking advantage of the opportunity (as CMU staff) to take part in the CMU intramural cross-country race was a way to fill in a gap in my collection of novel and exciting lifetime experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can bet I&amp;rsquo;ll be running this race again next year, and with every intention of placing higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-of-2012-09-27&#34;&gt;(Update of 2012-09-27)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/09/27/why-i-missed-the-cmu-intramural-xc-race-this-year/&#34;&gt;I ended up not running this race in 2012&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-note-on-shoes&#34;&gt;A note on shoes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran yesterday&amp;rsquo;s race in my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/products/Five-Fingers-BikilaLS-Mens.htm&#34;&gt;Vibram FiveFingers Bikila LS shoes&lt;/a&gt;, the first time I&amp;rsquo;d worn this pair of shoes in a race. I will run the Great Race in these shoes also. (More later on this blog about &amp;ldquo;minimalist shoes&amp;rdquo; and how they saved my life.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;preview-for-sunday&#34;&gt;Preview for Sunday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday I will be running the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rungreatrace.com/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Great Race 10K&lt;/a&gt;. This will be the ninth time I have run the race. Stay tuned for a race report on Sunday!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a photo of my running it for the first time, in 2000, as the second race I had ever done (and I had never run more than three miles continuously in my life at that time). It was quite an ordeal. The following year I ran the race better prepared, 8:51 faster.&lt;/p&gt;
