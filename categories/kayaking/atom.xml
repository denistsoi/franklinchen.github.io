      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over Memorial Day weekend, Abby and I went kayaking on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiskiminetas_River&#34;&gt;Kiski River&lt;/a&gt;, at the invitation of Steve, the guy we first met six years ago. There&amp;rsquo;s a story I&amp;rsquo;d like to share about what happened by chance six years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-meeting-steve-at-his-soup-hike-in-2008&#34;&gt;First meeting Steve at his &amp;ldquo;soup hike&amp;rdquo; in 2008&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby and I met Steve on a Pittsburgh hiking meetup hike on June 8, 2008 that he hosted in Apollo, PA, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/pittsburghhikers/events/8046324/&#34;&gt;second &amp;ldquo;soup hike&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; that has since then become a regular tradition. 13 people attended that soup hike. (The first instance of the soup hike, which we did not attend, was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/pittsburghhikers/events/7578281/&#34;&gt;on April 5, 2008&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original theme of the soup hike was that since the first one was in cold weather, participants were invited to bring soup to share in Steve&amp;rsquo;s garage after the hike. It would turn out, of course, that people brought all kinds of food, not just &amp;ldquo;soup&amp;rdquo;, but the name has stuck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is that I had to drag Abby into attending our first soup hike. Although we had done a little bit of hiking after we first met dancing, she had been uninterested in the longer hikes (over five miles) that I liked to do. (It turns out that she had a lot of knee and ankle and endurance problems at the time; we&amp;rsquo;ve found solutions in recent years, largely through the radical change in footwear to Vibram FiveFingers and also changes in diet.) I was very sad about this, because to be honest, I did not know how much longer I could date someone who was not going to be part of my weekend outdoors life (we had been together a year, but I was still spending much of my time hiking with my office mate John on weekends). It was a huge deal to me to encourage Abby to join me for hikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We both enjoyed the hike tremendously. It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful hike.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/soup-hike-2008-06-08/abby-franklin.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When Abby saw Jackson Falls, she knew she wanted to come back again to swim!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/soup-hike-2008-06-08/jackson-falls.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;kayaking&#34;&gt;Kayaking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the hike, I was surprised to see some people taking kayaks out to the Kiski River. Steve was letting people use his kayaks!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/soup-hike-2008-06-08/kayak.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At this point in my life, I had &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; voluntarily been in the water before. I&amp;rsquo;m terrible at swimming, had near-drowning experiences when young, and had never touched a kayak or canoe before. But Abby was all excited, and the view on the river look so nice.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/soup-hike-2008-06-08/kiski.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So Steve said we could briefly get on the river, and each of us took a kayak and just paddled around in the river for a few minutes. I was so scared the first time, and disoriented, but after a while, decided I really enjoyed this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, it was an amazing day, during which we met this great guy Steve who led us on a great hike, provided space and food in his garage, and even let us play with his kayaks. I was profoundly moved by his generosity, and the sense of fun that everyone brought to the event. Steve put us on his mailing list for his regular paddling trips, and ever since then, Abby and I have tried to join him for a couple of paddling trips a year, as our schedules and weather conditions allow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-photos-from-the-paddling-trip-we-just-came-back-from&#34;&gt;Some photos from the paddling trip we just came back from&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paddling trip &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/kayaking-129/events/181882042/&#34;&gt;we just did&lt;/a&gt; with Steve was a 9-miler on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conemaugh_River&#34;&gt;Conemaugh River&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blairsville,_Pennsylvania&#34;&gt;Blairsville&lt;/a&gt;. The water was rather low this day, but the weather was perfect: sunny, temperature in the 70s, not too high, and breezy, not so humid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that until today, we had not paddled in two years, because of our life situations last year, so we were really excited to have this opportunity this year.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/paddling-2014-05-25/finishing-loading.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Cute doggie coming with us:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/paddling-2014-05-25/dog.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The group starting down the river while I hang back to take a photo:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/paddling-2014-05-25/starting.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Passing a rookery:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/paddling-2014-05-25/rookery.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Lunch break on the water because the water levels were too low for us to get off on solid ground.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/paddling-2014-05-25/lunch.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A panorama:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/paddling-2014-05-25/panorama.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of several bridges along the route:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/paddling-2014-05-25/bridge.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Turning off to take out:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/paddling-2014-05-25/turn.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Panorama at take-out point:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/paddling-2014-05-25/panorama-take-out.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;logistics&#34;&gt;Logistics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s really complicated setting up these paddling trips, because not only does Steve personally hoist up and tie up several kayaks to tow himself, but also we try to consolidate people into as few vehicles as possible in order to set up an efficient shuttle between the take-out and put-in points. And after paddling, all the kayaks have to be put back on, and everyone transported back to their appropriate vehicles, and some people ending back up at Steve&amp;rsquo;s place while others just go back home. Basically, if you sign up for one of these trips, plan to spend the whole day outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, on this trip, which was especially involved because of how far everything was, and because it did not end at Steve&amp;rsquo;s place, we met up at 9:30 AM but didn&amp;rsquo;t leave till more like 10:30 AM. After arriving at the put-in location, we unloaded, Steve went with some others to drive to the take-out location, take one car back to the put-in, and then we finally got on the river at noon! We ended up getting off the river at 3:30 PM, but then had to get back to Steve&amp;rsquo;s place and help unload and clean up, and by the time we were done, it was 5:00 PM, time for a quick shower and then dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very time-consuming, but it&amp;rsquo;s good to invest the time to just relax and go with the flow all day and enjoy the scenery and camaraderie, rather than have anything else planned for later in the day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;food&#34;&gt;Food&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby made and brought a tasty zucchini dish, and some smoked Gouda cheese, to share for after paddling, and Steve provided burgers to grill. Many of the participants were newcomers and didn&amp;rsquo;t realize they should bring food to contribute, but they know now. In any case, there was still leftover watermelon, chips, cookies, and beers from the previous day. People also brought in foccacia, cole slaw, and pasta salad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ate two leftover homemade cookies immediately!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/paddling-2014-05-25/cookie1.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/paddling-2014-05-25/cookie2.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby&amp;rsquo;s zucchini was popular:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/paddling-2014-05-25/zucchini.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Steve&amp;rsquo;s burger patties, just off his grill:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/paddling-2014-05-25/burgers.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;bonfire&#34;&gt;Bonfire&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been occasions when we have stayed long enough to sit in front of the bonfire that Steve likes to make (we have camped overnight outside his place a couple of times), but usually we are really beat and head out to drive home before dark, so that&amp;rsquo;s what we did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six years ago I never went into water, but then thanks to meeting Steve, have had the opportunity to do kayaking a couple of times a year with Abby, expanding my experience of the natural world. It&amp;rsquo;s really a remarkable experience going down the river, powering yourself, facing the vastness of water and under the open sky. Also, it&amp;rsquo;s been inspiring to meet someone like Steve who is so generous and shares his knowledge and love of nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you been introduced to something new and beautiful in recent years, thanks to the kindness of someone you just met? If so, what are your thoughts on your fortune?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Five reasons we just stocked up on Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek shoes</title>

      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/08/28/five-reasons-we-just-stocked-up-on-vibram-fivefingers-kso-trek-shoes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/85802484@N06/7858001266&#34; title=&#34;&amp;quot;Run Around the Square&amp;quot;, Regent Square by sherpes39, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7253/7858001266_58020e37f8.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;375&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;Run Around the Square&amp;quot;, Regent Square&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby and I just stocked up on Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek shoes: we got &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; brand new pairs for me and &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; for her as well. Why the extravagant purchases? Here are five reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reason-1-trail-running&#34;&gt;Reason 1: trail running&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2010, I bought my first pair of KSO Trek shoes, primarily for the purpose of trail running, since I was sick and tired of the knee and shin and blistering problems I seemed to have whenever trail running extensively in any regular shoes, and I wanted more durability and protection against rocks than I got from running in less built-up racing flats meant for road running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I had bought the KSO shoes earlier, but they just weren&amp;rsquo;t, for me, suitable for much trail running, because of blistering issues and lack of protection (later, as I got used to more minimalist running, the protection no longer became an issue, but the blistering remained, so the last time I did trail running in the KSO shoes as a test was in June for &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/06/06/i-celebrated-national-running-day-in-schenley-park-remembering-how-i-began-to-run-13-year-ago/&#34;&gt;National Running Day&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a little bit of breaking in, during which I had a few blisters, &lt;em&gt;I never got blistered again, for two years and counting&lt;/em&gt;. The kangaroo leather is very nice and quickly seems to conform to your feet and becomes smooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have never run in the trails with my old regular monotoed running shoes again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have never experienced knee or shin problems again when trail running.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reason-2-hiking&#34;&gt;Reason 2: hiking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, I resisted the idea of wearing the KSO Trek hiking, because my typical hike involves terrain considerably rougher than my local trail runs, and goes on for more hours. But a year ago, in August 2011, following the lead of Abby, who started hiking in her Trek Sport shoes (which are similar to the KSO Trek in protection but are not made of kangaroo leather), I finally shed my &amp;ldquo;trail running&amp;rdquo; shoes that I had been hiking in, reluctantly, for several years (even though I always ended up with some knee/shin/calf/ankle/foot pain/soreness and some blistering on long hikes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;starting-out-with-6-miles&#34;&gt;Starting out with 6 miles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first KSO Trek hiking experience was on a hike that was only 6 miles long. But that experience was a revelation. I had &lt;em&gt;no problems&lt;/em&gt; at all during the hike. I just had some tightness in my right shin after that hike, undoubtedly due to imperfect form. But no blistering, and no lasting foot soreness. As a result, &lt;em&gt;I have never hiked again in regular monotoed shoes, but only in KSO Trek shoes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;moving-up-to-20-miles&#34;&gt;Moving up to 20 miles&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/kso-trek/rachel-carson-trail.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;On the Rachel Carson Trail&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This May, I decided I wanted to really put the KSO Trek to the test. I wore the shoes on my most extreme hike of this year, a 20-mile training hike on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://rachelcarsontrails.org/rct&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Trail&lt;/a&gt;. I finished the hike with no blisters whatsoever, no knee pain. Yes, my feet were sore as heck after all the banging on rocks and tree roots and down the hills, but foot soreness always happened anyway whenever I did a 20-mile hike on the Rachel Carson Trail in any footwear. The interesting thing is that I recovered from this foot soreness extremely quickly, much more quickly than I ever recovered from foot soreness wearing more padded shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I cannot answer the fascinating question of whether I could do the 35-mile &lt;a href=&#34;http://rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Trail Challenge&lt;/a&gt; in KSO Trek shoes. I have completed the Challenge three times, each time with a different pair of regular monotoed trail running shoes, and each time with leg and foot issues (including severe blisters). The reason I cannot answer the question is that my feet were noticeably &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; sore after 20 miles on the trail in KSO Trek than they ever were in the regular shoes. There might be a problem with scalability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;injinji-socks&#34;&gt;Injinji socks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, earlier, in March, I had gone on a really tough hilly, bushwhacking exploratory hike that was about 10 miles long, and worn Injinji toe socks with my KSO Trek shoes. The socks provided additional protection that completely removed foot soreness. Unfortunately, I simply did not enjoy the extra bulk around my toes, and therefore have chosen not to wear socks again except when necessary in cold weather. But it is certainly conceivable that with socks, 35 miles on the Rachel Carson might be doable with KSO Trek shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-recent-hike&#34;&gt;A recent hike&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby and I enjoyed &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.trails.com/tcatalog_trail.aspx?trailid=HGS212-001&#34;&gt;Atalaya Mountain&lt;/a&gt; in Santa Fe this month when we were in New Mexico. She wore her Trek Sport, I wore my KSO Trek.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/kso-trek/atalaya-abby.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Abby with Trek Sport&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/kso-trek/atalaya-franklin.jpg&#34; /&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin with KSO Trek&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;reason-3-paddling&#34;&gt;Reason 3: paddling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point, Abby and I decided to start wearing Vibram FiveFingers shoes kayaking. I started off wearing the KSO, but then realized that wearing the KSO Trek offered a lot of advantages with no down side. Being thicker and leather, they protected better against being under the sun. The extra protection when stepping out into the water and onto rocky shores was also welcome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rio-grande-paddling.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Kayaking down the Rio Grande&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Down the Rio Grande in New Mexico, with view of Sandia Crest.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;no-shoe-funk&#34;&gt;No shoe funk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://birthdayshoes.com/the-definitive-guide-to-cleaning-vibram-five-fingers-a-k-a-how-to-get-the-smell-out-of-your-vibrams&#34;&gt;infamous problem that the synthetic Vibram shoes tend to end up stinking&lt;/a&gt; after getting wet, even after washing! Abby and I found no perfect solution to this problem. It turns out that the leather shoes don&amp;rsquo;t suffer from this problem &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;. All I have to do is rinse the shoes thoroughly (without even any soap or detergent), air dry them, and then they are just fine. Believe it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reason-4-holes-in-my-toes-after-two-years-and-over-a-thousand-miles&#34;&gt;Reason 4: holes in my toes after two years and over a thousand miles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;discovering-holes-on-vulcan&#34;&gt;Discovering holes on Vulcan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know when holes started forming in my KSO Trek shoes from 2010, because I did not have a habit of checking regularly for holes. I only know that I started feeling the ground with my toes only after a particular outing during which I spent over an hour running the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nps.gov/petr/planyourvisit/volcanoes.htm&#34;&gt;three Petroglyph volcanoes&lt;/a&gt; near Albuquerque this month.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/kso-trek/petroglyph-volcanoes.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Panorama of Petroglyph volcanoes&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/kso-trek/franklin-petroglyph-volcanoes.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I was fairly high up on Vulcan and descending when I first noticed the sensations of volcanic rock rubbing on my bare toe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Here&amp;rsquo;s Abby hiking toward Vulcan after I had already run down and was headed the other way.)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Abby hiking to Vulcan&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;examining-the-holes&#34;&gt;Examining the holes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the holes, which occurred at the sides of the second toes of both my feet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/kso-trek/hole-in-left.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Hole in left shoe&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/kso-trek/hole-in-right.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Hole in right shoe&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Abby and I ordered and received our new shoes (Abby decided to finally also go for KSO Treks, after seeing how much I loved them in the past two years), I took some photos to illustrate the wear and tear:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/kso-trek/old-and-new.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the old shoes are pretty worn down:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/kso-trek/old-new-bottom.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/kso-trek/old-new-side.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to retire the old shoes yet, of course. I kind of like that they have, through being worn down, become more minimalist; feeling a little bit of dirt touch my toes once in a while is no problem at all (especially given my experiments with entirely barefoot running). I expect to continue to wear the old shoes for years to come; I did just start wearing a new pair (which &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/08/25/my-eighth-time-doing-run-around-the-square-5k/&#34;&gt;I just ran a race in and Abby also&lt;/a&gt;, but will come up with a rotation system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reason-5-vibram-is-discontinuing-the-kso-trek-shoes-and-they-are-on-sale&#34;&gt;Reason 5: Vibram is discontinuing the KSO Trek shoes and they are on sale!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the unbelievable news: Vibram is discontinuing the KSO Trek, my favorite shoe!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a sale is going on right now: we picked up four pairs at a clearance price, and so can you &lt;a href=&#34;http://birthdayshoes.com/labor-day-minimalist-barefoot-sales&#34;&gt;before they disappear for good&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very sad that Vibram is discontinuing the shoe that I have happily put well over a thousand miles on trail running, hiking, and paddling. I hope that by stocking up, I will be able to enjoy the KSO Trek for several years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reflections on 2011</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/12/31/reflections-on-2011/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2011 18:52:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/12/31/reflections-on-2011/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I reflect on my year of 2011 as it ends. Since I did not start blogging until September, I go into more detail of what happened before then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;january&#34;&gt;January&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I continued our project of massively reorganizing our home, a project that began when she moved in during summer 2010. We were very grateful that Abby&amp;rsquo;s father helped out a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I continued getting rid of a lot of stuff, including another eighteen boxes of my books, as I became an initially reluctant &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/minimalism/&#34;&gt;minimalist&lt;/a&gt;. We sold or gave away a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; number of various of belongings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby started cooking much more than in the past, and we enjoyed trying new dishes of her making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I enjoyed some light cross-country skiing in the winter, using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schenley_Park_Golf_Course&#34;&gt;Bob O&amp;rsquo;Connor Golf Course at Schenley Park&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I began a weekly Zen &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/meditation/&#34;&gt;meditation&lt;/a&gt; session offered at Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started moving very gradually toward a &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/paleo/&#34;&gt;paleo&lt;/a&gt; diet and exercise routine, and immediately experienced benefits. &amp;ldquo;The Paleo Solution&amp;rdquo; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://robbwolf.com/&#34;&gt;Robb Wolf&lt;/a&gt; was very useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started learning modern &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/javascript/&#34;&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; for a new project at work, getting into client-side Web development. As part of that, I learned &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/jquery/&#34;&gt;jQuery&lt;/a&gt; through a free &lt;a href=&#34;http://p2pu.org/&#34;&gt;P2PU&lt;/a&gt; course and used it in the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started using &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XQuery&#34;&gt;XQuery&lt;/a&gt; at work to process XML in a clear and concise way. I had used XSLT in the past, but it was very unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decided, for various reasons, to stop writing new &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/perl/&#34;&gt;Perl&lt;/a&gt; scripts and move to &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/python/&#34;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started playing in my final (and disastrous) &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/chess/&#34;&gt;chess&lt;/a&gt; tournament, the Pittsburgh Chess Club Championship (which I had won in 2006 and 2007).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;february&#34;&gt;February&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pittsburgh was all about the Steelers, and I went to a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLV&#34;&gt;Super Bowl&lt;/a&gt; party for the first time, but we lost!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I read &amp;ldquo;The Art of Non-Conformity&amp;rdquo; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://chrisguillebeau.com/&#34;&gt;Chris Guillebeau&lt;/a&gt; and found it so inspiring that I decided to take action and start making big changes to my life, in my own way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One big change: I quit playing chess, cold turkey, after having been unenthusiastic about it for months already (and playing correspondingly poorly). When the passion and enjoyment are gone, there is no point in hanging onto something just because it has been such an important part of my life for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of not playing any music at all, I started playing &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/recorder/&#34;&gt;recorder&lt;/a&gt;, and vowed to play every single day if possible. Ten months later, I am still playing recorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I began attending a lot of &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/16/pittsburgh-software-developer-communities/&#34;&gt;local software developer group meetings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started learning the &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/scala/&#34;&gt;Scala&lt;/a&gt; programming language and decided to use it on a small project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;march&#34;&gt;March&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I continued our meditation practice at CMU, and went to our first mini-&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesshin&#34;&gt;sesshin&lt;/a&gt; on a Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I continued practicing recorder every single day, and joined the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/lukas/pcars/Welcome.html&#34;&gt;local chapter of the American Recorder Society&lt;/a&gt;. It was very exciting to meet new people and to get into a wide range of music I had never really listened to or played.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I saw a video of &lt;a href=&#34;http://jakeshimabukuro.com/&#34;&gt;Jake Shimabukuro&lt;/a&gt; playing &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/ukulele/&#34;&gt;ukulele&lt;/a&gt; so beautifully that I was inspired to buy a ukulele and start learning to play it. (Unfortunately, it would turn out that time constraints caused me not to pursue ukulele far. This will change in 2012.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got pulled into the Ruby programming language because it is well-supported on Mac OS and it is easy to install libraries and tools, of which there are many that are quite useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I went to &lt;a href=&#34;http://farmtotablepa.com/&#34;&gt;Farm to Table&lt;/a&gt; in Pittsburgh, and after that, Abby started moving toward paleo eating, with even better results than my smaller experiments earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I started our &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/hiking/&#34;&gt;hiking&lt;/a&gt; season in the spring. Hiking is special to us; it was one of our first shared activities (after initially meeting during salsa dancing), and one we return to again and again. When there is no calendar conflict and the weather is acceptable, we like hiking almost every weekend from spring through fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% img /images/steves-soup-hike-2011-03-26.jpg Abby in front of me at Steve&amp;rsquo;s Soup Hike %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;april&#34;&gt;April&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started wearing &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/fivefingers/&#34;&gt;Vibram FiveFingers shoes&lt;/a&gt; almost all the time, whether walking or running (but not yet for hiking).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I went to &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/yoga/&#34;&gt;yoga&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.clpgh.org/locations/squirrelhill/&#34;&gt;Squirrel Hill Library&lt;/a&gt; for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;may&#34;&gt;May&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I began my experiment with barefoot running, in observation of &lt;a href=&#34;http://barefootrunners.org/ibrd&#34;&gt;International Barefoot Running Day&lt;/a&gt;. I started walking around barefoot at work, ignoring the confused looks or comments of colleagues. (I still go barefoot at work.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I bought a &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/melodica/&#34;&gt;melodica&lt;/a&gt;, inspired by the amazing performances of &lt;a href=&#34;http://jnote.org/&#34;&gt;James Howard Young&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I took a little vacation, spending some days in New York visiting Nathaniel and Yael and their baby. I finally fulfilled my dream (from before marriage) of taking Abby to Coney Island to walk on the boardwalk and at the beach, eating pizza, and riding the Wonder Wheel, just as I once did when I was six years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I started doing research into major home renovations for the summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I visited my parents, and my sister Linda and her husband Andre also visited, with my mother throwing a delayed reception at home for the both of us who had gotten married in the past two years. Abby got to meet my parents&amp;rsquo; friends, finally. And I went running with my brother-in-law for the first time! Also, I took Abby to the little park in Ann Arbor where as a too-shy teenager I used to go and sit on a particular bench and wish I were sitting with my dream girl. Mission accomplished!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;june&#34;&gt;June&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John and I did a tough 19-mile training hike on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Trail&lt;/a&gt; and decided we&amp;rsquo;d had enough of that trail, and I decided I was probably not going to do the 35-mile &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Trail Challenge&lt;/a&gt; again (having completed it three times in the past).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% img /images/rachel-carson-trail-2011-06-05.jpg John on Rachel Carson Trail %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby started wearing Vibram FiveFingers more and more for walking and running, and even walking barefoot on the streets (something I had not yet seriously done myself at the time).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stupidly threw out my back during exercise, and my back took weeks to fully recover (I could still run and hike, but not lift weights). Never again, I hope. I felt like a 90-year-old when my back was hurting constantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We started some home improvement projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;july&#34;&gt;July&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started gravitating to almost exclusively body weight &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/strength-training/&#34;&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt;, as a reaction to my having injured my back earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I went kayaking on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiskiminetas_River&#34;&gt;Kiski River&lt;/a&gt; with &amp;ldquo;Fireman Steve&amp;rdquo; and the kayaking gang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a longish hike, Abby surprised me by wearing Vibram FiveFingers shoes and they worked great for her, making her much faster and less sore, and I made a note to ditch my trail running shoes (which I had been using for years for hiking) in favor of FiveFingers for my next hike (which I did, and I have not gone back to regular shoes for hiking!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I finally took Abby to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sandhillberries.com/&#34;&gt;Sand Hill Berries&lt;/a&gt; for tasty pie for the first time, always having intended to take her there when dating, but never having been in the vicinity with her then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major home renovation finally began, after much research, and we got electrical upgrade, insulation, and bathroom demolition and rebuilding. Very disruptive to our lives for weeks!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I did another mini-&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesshin&#34;&gt;sesshin&lt;/a&gt; at CMU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a lifetime of almost never drinking coffee (average of maybe three or four cups a year), I became an avid espresso fan (one small cup a day) as a result of my boss getting a machine at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started doing more barefoot running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;august&#34;&gt;August&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bathroom renovation done at last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I were regularly hiking in Vibram FiveFingers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% img /images/abby-franklin-soup-hike-vibram.jpg Abby and Franklin on Steve&amp;rsquo;s Soup Hike part 3 wearing Vibram FiveFingers %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby joined me to run in her first ever 5K race, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.runaroundthesquare.com/&#34;&gt;Run Around the Square&lt;/a&gt; in Regent Square (mostly on the trails of Frick Park). What a special day! This race was my first ever 5K race when I started running in races in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started to learn &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/accordion/&#34;&gt;accordion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;september&#34;&gt;September&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started running to work two or three times a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I ran in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kalp/PGR/&#34;&gt;CMU SCS Pretty Good Race 5K&lt;/a&gt; together, her second 5K race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I went to &lt;a href=&#34;http://podcamppittsburgh.com/&#34;&gt;PodCamp Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;, and after that, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/09/22/starting-a-new-web-site/&#34;&gt;I started this blog&lt;/a&gt; and proceeded to maintain a habit of posting every day (a routine that has been modified since then).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;october&#34;&gt;October&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started expanding beyond just writing for my blog, and began contributing to the Web through &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/franklinchen&#34;&gt;my Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; as well as writing comments on other people&amp;rsquo;s blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started taking Stanford online classes: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ml-class.org/&#34;&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.db-class.org/&#34;&gt;Introduction to Databases&lt;/a&gt;. (Blog posts on my experiences to appear soon.) Unfortunately, as a result of the extra time commitment, October through December were quite hectic for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I continued to move more toward a paleo diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;november&#34;&gt;November&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started playing &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/flute/&#34;&gt;flute&lt;/a&gt; again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably because of fatigue and a compromised immune system, I came down with a skin ailment that I got serious treatment for, but it took almost two months to completely clear up and I spent over a month truly miserable &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;december&#34;&gt;December&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started playing Baroque flute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started playing tin whistle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I prepared for and made it through two music performances, playing recorder and flute (and almost tin whistle).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ended the year completely exhausted, on the verge of getting sick, and took a long break from blogging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final week, Abby and I were on a hectic travel schedule that involved meeting up with her parents, my parents, her sister Carrie, Carrie&amp;rsquo;s boyfriend Alain, Alain&amp;rsquo;s parents, Alain&amp;rsquo;s extended family, my sister Linda, and her husband Andre. I am grateful that we got to meet up with so many people (and arranged for various of the individuals to meet up with various of the others!), but the trip was quite stressful to me, because I was not physically or emotionally prepared for it at all. (I will report later on what I learned from the experience.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2011 was quite a year for me and Abby. We had many changes and adventures in our lives: our home, our diet, our exercise, our outdoors activities, travel. For me, the biggest changes were quitting chess, starting music practice and performance, throwing myself into blogging and tweeting, getting more and more active in local software developer groups, applying new (to me) development tools at work, and in the fall, taking Stanford online courses in computer science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I ended the year in poor shape, because of being overbooked, I am very excited by how many positive changes took place. I have an entirely new set of plans and priorities to formulate soon for 2012 in collaboration with Abby, in hope of learning from the lessons of my failures and omissions of 2011, and restoring balance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
