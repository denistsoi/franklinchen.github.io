        &lt;h4&gt;Grand March&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So this year I joined Abby again to play in the &amp;ldquo;Holiday Ball Orchestra&amp;rdquo; as I had &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/12/16/playing-recorder-and-flute-at-the-holiday-ball/&#34;&gt;done for the first time last year&lt;/a&gt;, for the annual &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/pages/Pittsburgh-Holiday-Ball/283731778337030&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Contras and Squares Holiday Ball&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experience at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/events/383908395031216/&#34;&gt;this year&amp;rsquo;s event&lt;/a&gt; compared to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/events/308706299154491/&#34;&gt;last year&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt;, and thoughts about the future:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;preparation&#34;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I was much more &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/11/24/preparing-to-play-irish-flute-in-the-holiday-ball/&#34;&gt;prepared&lt;/a&gt; this second time than the first time. Not only have I been playing any music at all for an entire extra year, but also, I had prior knowledge of and access to most of the music that is played every year, so I could start my practice well before the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;costumes&#34;&gt;Costumes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby wanted me to dress up again. Since people enjoyed my wearing red pants last year, I wore them again this year. I was tired of the whole green thing, however, and so I wore a pink shirt and red vest to go all out on the red theme. I added a sport jacket also, one that had been too big for me my whole life till now; it turns out that my blazer that I wore last year is too small now, as my chest has noticeably expanded in the past year (probably because of weight lifting, posture changes, and playing wind instruments). I added a beret that I&amp;rsquo;d never worn before.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/holiday-ball-2012/franklin.jpg&#34; /&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Abby came up with her own colorful outfit.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/holiday-ball-2012/abby-octave-mandolin.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Abby&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;venue&#34;&gt;Venue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was afraid that Swisshelm Park Community Center would be super cold again like last year, but I did bring my Handeze fingerless gloves just in case. It turned out that the place was warm (it&amp;rsquo;s been a very warm &amp;ldquo;winter&amp;rdquo;), and so I did not have any problems feeling cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-stage&#34;&gt;On stage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year I think there were somewhat fewer musicians in the Holiday Ball Orchestra than last year. I thought this was actually a good thing. Last year there were some real problems with space and also with ensemble balance (there were a whole lot of violins last year, for example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;instruments&#34;&gt;Instruments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I brought my modern flute, wooden keyless Irish flute, and tin whistle. Last year I had played primarily recorder, but this year I chose not to play recorder at all: the Irish flute was what I wanted to use as much as possible for this music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also brought my melodica! I had practiced playing the Hallelujah Chorus part of the Grand March using it and was excited to make my melodica debut. I also planned to use it in some of the Christmas songs, such as &amp;ldquo;Frosty the Snowman&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby brought an &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave_mandolin&#34;&gt;octave mandolin&lt;/a&gt; she had been borrowing. She started playing mandolin just this year, and octave mandolin just in the past couple of weeks, I think. This instrument is so much better suited to the music, she says, than her tamburitza she played last year.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/holiday-ball-2012/instruments.jpg&#34; /&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Our instruments&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Several &amp;ldquo;kazumpets&amp;rdquo; (kazoo trumpets) were also provided by Lynette and Jim, and passed out to whoever wanted to play them during certain songs. Abby took one.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/holiday-ball-2012/abby-kazumpet.jpg&#34; /&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Abby with kazumpet&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;dancing&#34;&gt;Dancing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Abby and I have now actually done some &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/10/07/my-first-contra-dance-workshop-unexpected-fun/&#34;&gt;contra dancing together&lt;/a&gt;, there was a question of whether we would do any dancing. Abby and I discussed this before the event; Abby was very excited to play music on octave mandolin, and so she did not want to dance, so we did no dancing. Like I said last year: &amp;ldquo;We can always dance some other time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the other musicians were very excited about dancing and pre-arranged to spend one half or the other of the time dancing instead of playing music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw a lot of familiar faces among the dancers, thanks to having met some of them when doing French and contra dances at CMU, and others I met from non-dance contexts elsewhere in the past year in Pittsburgh. It was nice to see my friend Henry and his girlfriend Gina at the dance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;off-and-running&#34;&gt;Off and running&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marlin was the caller again as usual and the evening proceeded with the Grand March and then the whole big assortment of jigs, reels, waltzes, Christmas songs, and a couple of interesting new pieces for this year.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/holiday-ball-2012/grand-march.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Grand March&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have additional interesting photos or videos to share from during the event, because I took none: after the initial Grand March, I was entirely focused just on playing music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;overall-experience&#34;&gt;Overall experience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was far less nervous than I was last year. Also, I positioned myself near, rather than deliberately far away from, a microphone, in order to be more audible. I don&amp;rsquo;t actually know what I sounded like, but some dancers during intermission commented that they liked the sound of the wooden Irish flute, so I guess it must have been audible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playing music for hours is tiring, especially when it is so fast and there are so many notes. Of course, nobody is required to play all the notes all the time. I picked and chose when to take breaks, typically alternating repeats or entire sections. And there is definitely a limit to how long I can play flutes before my mouth gives up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the second half, a guy who had danced during the first half played a keyed Irish flute and tin whistle with us. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen him at the two of three rehearsals I had attended, so I hadn&amp;rsquo;t known someone else would be playing those instruments. As a result, I changed some things up in the second half, by playing the tin whistle sometimes when he was playing the flute, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did play the melodica as planned, but noticed that the intonation was poor in the lower notes, so I backed off. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to fix this problem before I do more melodica playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose not to force myself to &amp;ldquo;achieve&amp;rdquo; some of the &amp;ldquo;goals&amp;rdquo; I set last year, which were to do some solos and nontrivial ornamentation/improvisation. I felt that because of the natural of my musical focus all this year, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t had time to devote to getting good enough to really justify taking the spotlight for some tunes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The music is still crazy fast: I am still not able to play everything quite properly at the appropriate tempo. Frustrating, but that&amp;rsquo;s OK. I expect to continue to improve my technique; I&amp;rsquo;m already so much better than I was last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I very much enjoyed performing for the Holiday Ball this year. And I feel like the Holiday Ball Orchestra sounded better this year than we did last year, and some dancers remarked on this also. I think there are several reasons for this. One is that we had some people coming back for the second time (like me), much improved. Another is that there were slightly fewer people, which I think creates a tighter ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;goals-for-the-future&#34;&gt;Goals for the future&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, I&amp;rsquo;m just totally exhausted and happy to be done with music performance of any kind this year. It&amp;rsquo;s been a very tough week, a very tough month, and a very tough two months in my life, with all the things that piled up on me since the end of October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because December always ends up being so frantic for me, for next year I need to better plan what activities I pursue during this time of year. Last year, I was totally set on playing again this year in the Holiday Ball. Now, I am not sure whether I will continue for next year. It&amp;rsquo;s a question of priorities, and I need to plan what I will be doing next year in December. If I do it again next year, then clearly I want to be doing some solos!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;thank-yous&#34;&gt;Thank yous&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I have to thank Lynette for organizing the music scores and putting it into booklets for everyone. Jim made the kazumpets. Donna, Allison, and Maro led the rehearsals as well as conducted and played their instruments with enthusiasm; I&amp;rsquo;ve been really happy to have met them a year ago, because I&amp;rsquo;ve been encountering them in other musical contexts in Pittsburgh in the past year too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We play for the dancers, and so I really appreciate it when they take note of our playing and respond to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And none of this would happened without Abby, who got me into the whole scene in the first place. I&amp;rsquo;ve met so many musicians and dancers, and tried out different instruments and musical styles and dances in the past year, thanks to Abby!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A very important event for me last year was joining Abby in playing music at the annual &lt;a href=&#34;http://pittsburghcontra.org/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Contras and Squares&lt;/a&gt; Holiday Ball at the Swisshelm Park Community Center as part of the &amp;ldquo;Holiday Ball Orchestra&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I started to prepare to play music for the Holiday Ball (Friday, December 14) again: I have three weeks to practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What progress have I made in the past year on the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/12/16/playing-recorder-and-flute-at-the-holiday-ball/&#34;&gt;goals I listed after last year&amp;rsquo;s event&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;improvement-at-instruments&#34;&gt;Improvement at instruments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, I wrote: &amp;ldquo;I want to be much better at all the instruments I would play in it (recorder, flute, tin whistle)&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My status this year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m better at &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/recorder/&#34;&gt;recorder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m much better at &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/flute/&#34;&gt;flute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve only barely worked on &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/tin-whistle/&#34;&gt;tin whistle&lt;/a&gt;, but am automatically better at it because of getting better at other instruments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I unexpectedly got an &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/irish-flute/&#34;&gt;Irish flute&lt;/a&gt;, which I have mostly been playing for &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/french-dance/&#34;&gt;French dance&lt;/a&gt;, but which &lt;strong&gt;I intend to be my main instrument for the Holiday Ball&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a sound and style point of view, the Irish flute is clearly the best of my instruments to use for the Holiday Ball. So I read through my copies of the Holiday Ball music (lots of jigs, reels, waltzes) tonight at speed, to see where I stand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, I could play (on any instrument) barely any of the music at speed, even on my best instrument at the time, which was soprano recorder. I was reduced to sitting out some tunes or playing just a single note each measure, when I otherwise would have been unable to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I found that I could get through most of the selections OK at speed, but somewhat sloppily and inaccurately. I would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be happy to have to perform this music at speed tonight; I would rather sit out or simplify rather than try to play something beyond me. But I have three weeks to improve significantly, and I believe I can improve enough that when the time comes, I won&amp;rsquo;t be sitting out most of the tunes the way I kind of did last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the fingering of the tin whistle is the same as for my keyless Irish flute, I can also choose to use the tin whistle where I feel appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;microphone&#34;&gt;Microphone&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, I wrote: &amp;ldquo;I want to be proficient and confident enough to sit by a microphone&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of being in the foreground is still a bit daunting to me, but I think after I get in some good practice over the next week or so, I&amp;rsquo;ll feel confident about not just being in the background the way I was last year. I do think it would be nice to have an audible Irish flute in our performance for the dancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;solos&#34;&gt;Solos&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, I wrote: &amp;ldquo;I want to do some solos, with stylistically appropriate improvisations&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even scarier. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working through &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/_posts/2012/06/12/ordered-the-casey-burns-small-handed-irish-flute/&#34;&gt;Grey Larsen&amp;rsquo;s book&lt;/a&gt;, which is amazingly detailed and good, but as Irish music has &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; at all been my focus during this year of music for me, I&amp;rsquo;m nowhere at the level of passing for a traditional Irish musician. Still, there is time to work up a sound basic practical level of ornamentation, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll have to evaluate, after a week or two, what I feel comfortable doing on stage. The basic rule is: better to play an melody simply and beautifully, unornamented, rather than do something badly and in poor taste and technique!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dance&#34;&gt;Dance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, I wrote: &amp;ldquo;Maybe I should learn some of the dances and perform some too&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that in fact, I did learn some &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/10/07/my-first-contra-dance-workshop-unexpected-fun/&#34;&gt;contra dance&lt;/a&gt;, so depending on how Abby would like to split up playing music and dancing, I would be, unlike last year, totally up for participating as a dancer as well as a musician.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a lot of fun playing music at the Holiday Ball last year and hope to enjoy it again, and this time with a higher level of musicality and a higher level of contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re in the Pittsburgh area and like contra dancing, make sure to put Friday, December 14 on your calendar already, and come to the Holiday Ball!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I was invited by Donna to attend a musicians&amp;rsquo; workshop being held as part of the&lt;a href=&#34;http://pittsburghcontra.org/fdw/fdw-2012-schedule/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh contra fall dance weekend&lt;/a&gt;. Members of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.greatbeartrio.com/Great_Bear_Trio/Home.html&#34;&gt;Great Bear Trio&lt;/a&gt; discussed their perspective on the interplay between music and dance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a great opportunity to hear some frank and useful advice about how to work with dancers as musicians in order to collaborate to create great experiences for both, given that often there are differences in expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-of-2014-01-16&#34;&gt;(Update of 2014-01-16)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an unfinished post that is one of many in the past two years that lay unfinished because I had originally planned to write a very detailed report but never got around to it. I decided that I might as well release all these unfinished posts rather than leave them completely out of the record.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My first contra dance workshop: unexpected fun!</title>

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Today Abby and I attended the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/events/374623475947550/&#34;&gt;first CMU contra dance workshop&lt;/a&gt; put on by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/catsdancepgh&#34;&gt;Carnegie Alliance of Traditional and Social Dance&lt;/a&gt;, as I mentioned we might when I wrote about the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/09/28/another-french-music-jam-also-announcing-cats-dance/&#34;&gt;formation of CATS Dance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to understand that for years I &lt;em&gt;resisted&lt;/em&gt; the idea of ever doing contra dancing. I had some bad memories of being forced to do a bit of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_dance&#34;&gt;square dancing&lt;/a&gt; in elementary school, I have a tendency to resist choreographed patterns, and frankly, I associated contra dancing with old, maybe clumsy people. In the past year, having met plenty of people who mentioned doing contra dancing, and who clearly are not old and clumsy (some are old but far from clumsy), I&amp;rsquo;d gotten interested in giving it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seed was first planted just from happening to get pulled into &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/12/11/learning-another-instrument-the-tin-whistle/&#34;&gt;playing music for contra dancing ten months ago&lt;/a&gt;. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t act on it, other than participating a little bit impromptu &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/03/31/my-first-sampling-of-english-country-dance-and-contra-dance/&#34;&gt;at a birthday party&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I finally went for a full four-hour workshop, held at CMU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a great time, way beyond my expectations!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;turnout&#34;&gt;Turnout&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The turnout was great. I estimate there were about thirty to forty participants. Most of them appeared to be undergrad or grad students; others were older people, many of whom Abby and I already knew from elsewhere, including the &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/french-dance/&#34;&gt;French dance workshops we&amp;rsquo;ve attended in the past several months&lt;/a&gt;. The predominance of young people was a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;caller&#34;&gt;Caller&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were really blessed today to have a great caller, &lt;a href=&#34;http://wa64.com/Waltz.html&#34;&gt;Gaye Fifer&lt;/a&gt;, who is not only clear in her instruction and calling, but also was always very observant and helpful to anyone who was in her line of sight. Whenever I was near her and messing up, she noticed and efficiently got me back on track. She did that for everyone, not just me. Given the size of the crowd, I found that care and attention to detail really impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaye made the whole learning experience effective, friendly, and joyful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;band&#34;&gt;Band&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/first-contra-dance/gallimaufry.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Gallimaufry&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We also had a fantastic live band, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/gallimaufryband&#34;&gt;Gallimaufry&lt;/a&gt;, from Oberlin. This is a group of five youthful and very skilled musicians playing a whole bunch of instruments. I saw fiddle, cello, electric guitar, accordion, piano, drums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They played with great rhythm and sheer exuberance and expression, and seamless ensemble work. Wow. They were rocking out. They knew how to ramp it up to get the dancers moving and smiling!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;participants&#34;&gt;Participants&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy level and enthusiasm of the dancers today was great. I have been in dance situations in which some of the dancers were not fully engaged, not really getting into the music or the movement, or choosing to remain distant with those they rotated around to dance with. I think it&amp;rsquo;s really important, for this kind of dance to work, for everyone to be fully present and open to the experience, and open to dancing with everyone else. It&amp;rsquo;s a communal experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a mix of beginners (like myself) as well as those who clearly already knew what they were doing. This was actually very helpful because those who knew what they were doing kept the rest of us on the right track, both through personal example and through verbal and physical reminders of what to do. As a result, typically after repeating a pattern ten times (down one end of the room to the next and then back) while the music went on and on, I was able to improve during each iteration to the point that by the end of each dance we learned, I more or less knew what to do and how to do it (not that I necessarily remembered it exactly or executed it smoothly).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, I got pretty sweaty during the four-hour workshop. It was intense. This isn&amp;rsquo;t just shuffling around: it&amp;rsquo;s real exercise, with the music being lively and everyone being in constant motion. I was starving and dehydrated after the first two hours!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;watching&#34;&gt;Watching&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/first-contra-dance/abby-david.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Abby partnering with David&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There was a snack break halfway through, but I took other breaks to catch my breath and rest my mind, since the dances got progressively more complicated and faster (counting in four rather than eight, for example, and traveling more). It was fun to take a break and watch people dance, because the more experienced dancers added their own ornaments and spins and looked so smooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the caller pointed out, the subtlety and the fun in contra dancing comes from making all the &lt;em&gt;transitions&lt;/em&gt; smooth and coordinated. I have a lot of work to do to continue improving, but during the hours of the workshop as I learned to be more aware of my immediate circle and relative positions and movements, I got a real sense of how I could really improve my experience of and enjoyment of contra dance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;french-dance-during-break&#34;&gt;French dance during break&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, during the break, Lisa taught some basic French dance to those who just couldn&amp;rsquo;t get too much dancing. Hopefully this will translate into increased participation in the upcoming French dance workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;waltzes&#34;&gt;Waltzes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a nice typical touch, each of the two sets were concluded with a waltz. Abby and I enjoyed the opportunity to dance together, just the two of us, during the waltzes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-next&#34;&gt;What next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby and I have known for a while, of course, about the regular &lt;a href=&#34;http://pittsburghcontra.org/&#34;&gt;Friday night contra dance by the Pittsburgh Contras and Squares&lt;/a&gt;. That&amp;rsquo;s not a great time and day, unfortunately, because going out late on a Friday night does not appeal to me. I like the weekend afternoon schedule of the CMU French and contra dance workshops, currently held 4-7 PM. Being held at CMU also has the large advantages of being very close to home as well as encouraging a good turnout of young people to keep the energy up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the current CMU schedule continues, that makes it much more likely that we&amp;rsquo;ll continue to do French and contra dancing regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I expect to play music at the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/12/16/playing-recorder-and-flute-at-the-holiday-ball/&#34;&gt;annual holiday ball&lt;/a&gt; again this year. This time, I am sure I will have no fear about maybe taking part in the dancing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had an unforgettable dance experience today. I never expected to enjoy contra dancing so much, but because of how friendly all of the workshop participants were, and the caller, and the amazing band, I feel like I now have a taste of why people do this, and I hope to do more!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;On Monday I participated for my third time in Lisa&amp;rsquo;s French traditional dance music jam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/08/27/my-second-french-music-jam-playing-my-irish-flute-in-public-for-the-first-time/&#34;&gt;Last time&lt;/a&gt;, I started playing my &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/irish-flute/&#34;&gt;Irish flute&lt;/a&gt; at the jam, continued playing my &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/baroque-flute/&#34;&gt;Baroque flute&lt;/a&gt;, and left my modern flute at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, I changed things up. Also, we got a new musician playing a new instrument!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;instruments-and-musicians&#34;&gt;Instruments and musicians&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lisa was on fiddle as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we had John, who brought and used various kinds of accordions and his mandolin. (He had also brought recorders, in case I wanted to play with him, but I did not bring my recorders.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allison was on piano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donna was on fiddle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most exciting to me was that Cindy came and played &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoharp&#34;&gt;autoharp&lt;/a&gt;. I think the addition of the harmonic accompaniment and countermelodies she provided was really nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-instruments&#34;&gt;My instruments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; bring my Baroque flute this time. I made a decision this week that I was no longer going to try to play my Baroque flute in most public situations. I have been frustrated that its soft sound gets drowned out by other instruments and just by people talking and socializing at parties. Therefore, when playing the Baroque flute in public, I will reserve it for very quiet performance situations only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did bring my Irish flute, which served well when we were playing in appropriate keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have begun caving in and bringing my modern flute. It can be played more easily in all kinds of keys, and has the power to actually be heard. Maybe one day I&amp;rsquo;ll have a keyed wooden flute to play traditional music on, but that day is not near at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after some experimentation, I believe I&amp;rsquo;m come to the right instrument(s) for different situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;carnegie-alliance-of-traditional-and-social-dance-cats-dance&#34;&gt;Carnegie Alliance of Traditional and Social Dance (CATS Dance)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to take this opportunity to promote the new CMU-based dance group, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://thebridge.cmu.edu/organization/catsdance&#34;&gt;Carnegie Alliance of Traditional and Social Dance&lt;/a&gt;. Check out also their &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/catsdancepgh&#34;&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This group has been formed in order to grow a local community of people interested in all kinds of traditional and social dance, French dance being just one example; contra dancing and other folk dancing are also being explored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, this group exists because there is increasing interest among young people in these kinds of dances and music. The Pittsburgh dance scene has sometimes been dominated by older people, and it&amp;rsquo;s good to get younger people involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week CATS Dance organized an outing to the regular &lt;a href=&#34;http://pittsburghcontra.org/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Contras and Squares&lt;/a&gt; Friday dance. Tomorrow there will be a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/events/105195582969170/&#34;&gt;French dance workshop and social dance&lt;/a&gt; held directly on CMU campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These workshops and dances are, of course, open to everyone, not just CMU students. Abby and I are not CMU students, but &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/01/23/discovering-french-traditional-dance-in-pittsburgh/&#34;&gt;started attending&lt;/a&gt; these workshops at CMU in January. All ages and levels of dancers are always welcome! If you&amp;rsquo;re curious, drop by and check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first contra dance workshop to be hosted at CMU has also already been scheduled, for Sunday, October 7. Since I&amp;rsquo;ve never been to a contra dance workshop (although I had a sampling of contra dance at a birthday party &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/03/31/my-first-sampling-of-english-country-dance-and-contra-dance&#34;&gt;six months ago&lt;/a&gt;; I was very confused by it then), I hope Abby and I will make it to this workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-of-2012-10-07&#34;&gt;(Update of 2012-10-07)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/10/07/my-first-contra-dance-workshop-unexpected-fun/&#34;&gt;Abby and I did make it to the contra dance workshop&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continue to greatly enjoy the regular French music jam and meeting and playing with more musicians. Meanwhile, although I have not done much dancing lately, I am excited about the creation of CATS Dance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My first sampling of English country dance and contra dance</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/03/31/my-first-sampling-of-english-country-dance-and-contra-dance/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 31 Mar 2012 23:01:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/03/31/my-first-sampling-of-english-country-dance-and-contra-dance/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;By &amp;ldquo;accident&amp;rdquo;, today I participated in my first sampling of both &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_country_dance&#34;&gt;English country dance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_dance&#34;&gt;contra dance&lt;/a&gt;. Abby and I went to a large birthday celebration in which many of the guests were musicians and dancers, and hence there was live music performed by friends and someone who taught and called dances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hadn&amp;rsquo;t intended to participate, despite &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/12/11/learning-another-instrument-the-tin-whistle/&#34;&gt;having the idea of trying contra dance planted in my head three months ago&lt;/a&gt;, but out of a sense of etiquette and opportunity, did participate in a couple of the &amp;ldquo;easier&amp;rdquo; dances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;confusion&#34;&gt;Confusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I expected, I was totally confused. It was hard for me to remember what was what, turning in a circle, moving down the line with a partner, rotating around, switching places, all that stuff. The instruction went by way too fast for me. Afterwards, I could remember very little of anything that I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;benefits&#34;&gt;Benefits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I left the party being far less &amp;ldquo;afraid&amp;rdquo; of English country dance and contra dance. I muddled through just enough that I &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; that if I applied myself, I could get it, and maybe even enjoy it. It is often hard to know up front whether a new activity will be enjoyable, because I (like most people, I believe) can&amp;rsquo;t enjoy something when I&amp;rsquo;m doing it way too badly. I can enjoy something that I&amp;rsquo;ve grown minimally competent enough to appreciate it. I still don&amp;rsquo;t know yet whether I could enjoy English country dance or contra dance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;opportunity&#34;&gt;Opportunity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently planning to attend in July the annual &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mideastearlymusic.addr.com/&#34;&gt;Mideast early music workshop&lt;/a&gt;. They offer a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mideastearlymusic.addr.com/class.html&#34;&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; in English country dance, so it&amp;rsquo;s possible I may want to take that class, if they start from the very basics. However, given time constraints, I would rather be taking music classes at the camp rather than dance classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sampler lessons like the one at the birthday party today are nice for exposing a total beginner to something new, as an appetizer toward deeper learning, but as I learned in the past, real learning requires sustained and detailed work on basics, with incremental mastery resulting from repetition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-of-2013-01-23&#34;&gt;(Update of 2013-01-23)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that I did attend the English country dance at the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/07/21/mideast-early-music-workshop-a-life-changing-experience/&#34;&gt;Mideast early music workshop in July 2012&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, Abby and I went to &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/10/07/my-first-contra-dance-workshop-unexpected-fun/&#34;&gt;our first contra dance workshop&lt;/a&gt; in October 2012!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Playing recorder and flute at the Holiday Ball!</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/12/17/playing-recorder-and-flute-at-the-holiday-ball/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Dec 2011 23:17:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/12/17/playing-recorder-and-flute-at-the-holiday-ball/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So on Friday, after &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/12/01/im-going-to-perform-music-much-sooner-than-i-expected-monday/&#34;&gt;just two weeks&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/12/05/busy-evening-performing-at-phipps-followed-by-rehearsal-for-another-gig/&#34;&gt;practicing music&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://pittsburghcontra.org/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Contras and Squares&lt;/a&gt; Holiday Ball, the moment of truth finally arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event went pretty well! Here is a report, with some photos and videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;costumes&#34;&gt;Costumes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby had said that we were supposed to show up dressed &amp;ldquo;festively&amp;rdquo;, so I thought, OK, I&amp;rsquo;ll wear something green and something red, for the holiday season. I immediately thought of a green shirt and red pants I have. Abby came up with the idea that I should wear a hat, and so I picked out one of my hats (which I only wear for costume parties) and she put a green band around it. I feared being cold (and rightfully so, it turned out), and so I added a blazer and a tie to the outfit. A good number of people seemed to like this colorful outfit!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/holiday-ball-2011/abby-franklin-holiday-ball.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Abby and Franklin posing before event&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;venue&#34;&gt;Venue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had never been to the Swisshelm Park Community Center before, but since Abby had, she had warned me that it was cold on stage at this time last year. Indeed it was. I was very, very happy to be wearing a hat and my blazer. In the future, I&amp;rsquo;ll remember to bring my Handeze fingerless gloves to gigs anywhere (and pack a hat and layers of clothing), to keep my hands warm when not performing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-stage&#34;&gt;On stage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around twenty-five musicians eventually gathered on stage. There was just enough space for all of us, although it was crowded. I got put in the &amp;ldquo;wind section&amp;rdquo;, armed with my main instrument I had finally decided on for this gig, soprano recorder (which I had started practicing the music for only a couple of days before!!), along with my secondary instrument, flute, which I planned to use only on the Hallelujah Chorus and some waltzes, and finally, the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/12/11/learning-another-instrument-the-tin-whistle/&#34;&gt;tin whistle&lt;/a&gt;, which I did not have enough time to play well enough for most of the music, and therefore planned to possibly use on only one piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/holiday-ball-2011/franklin-soprano-recorder.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin posing with soprano recorder&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/holiday-ball-2011/franklin-flute.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin posing with flute&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby sat to my right with her tamburitza. This was the first time we have ever played music together at an event!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/holiday-ball-2011/abby-tamburitza.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Abby posing with tamburitza&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;off-and-running&#34;&gt;Off and running&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marlin, the caller, kicked things off and the bagpiper led the Grand March and after he played for a while, we started playing. Before each group of dances, Marlin gave a brief lesson to the dancers.  We had jigs, reels, waltzes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout, Donna and Allison split the conducting, with Maro at the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-videos&#34;&gt;Some videos&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to get some videos with my digital camera while on stage, because I didn&amp;rsquo;t play continuously. We often did three or four or even more repeats, such that I would sit out and rest and have an opportunity to switch instruments or take photos. With twenty-five of us playing, there wasn&amp;rsquo;t a need for any one individual to be playing lots of notes all the time (except for Maro at the keyboard!). We also changed things up so that we&amp;rsquo;d alternate among the &amp;ldquo;reeds&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;winds&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;fiddles&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;strings&amp;rdquo;, etc. for variety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a clip of me playing soprano recorder during Coleraine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/JZqMmpwQwZE&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a view of some of the others during Coleraine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/CgVVxWq1hLE&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is dancing to Whalen&amp;rsquo;s Breakdown:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/LNiUdN_4-44&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;something-unexpected&#34;&gt;Something unexpected&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned earlier that I had planned to possibly play tin whistle in one piece, which was the fourth in a medley, of which we had been told we would not be playing the third. Since we were not supposed to play the third, I had crossed it out and not even sight read it once (given that I had less than two weeks to try to learn thirty pieces we were going to play).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guess what? Somehow, after the second piece in the medley ended, I got completely confused, because we went into the third one that we weren&amp;rsquo;t supposed to play. This third one was Whalen&amp;rsquo;s Breakdown, which I got video of above. Eventually I joined in and started playing it, but not on tin whistle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;overall-experience&#34;&gt;Overall experience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time went by surprisingly quickly. Getting set up and ready on stage, the time passed quickly (I was glad we arrived quite early). I was surprisingly hungry after we took a break after the first hour, and was grateful to enjoy a plate of cookies I gathered from the table near the entrance, where dancers and musicians had brought in food to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally there had been talk of some of us musicians sitting out the first or second half because of space constraints, but since it turned out that there was enough space for all of us who ended up participating, Abby and I did not need to leave. She asked me if I wanted to stop playing and dance instead for the second half, but I was all excited about playing (and had worked so hard to practice the music) that I said I&amp;rsquo;d like to continue playing. We can always dance some other time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I knew from my practice that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t play all the pieces (at the speed required) or all the notes, I was happy to contribute in my own small way where I could (and I was not seated very near any of the microphones, ha!). There was safety in numbers, definitely. I did the best I could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;goals-for-the-future&#34;&gt;Goals for the future&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next year, I&amp;rsquo;d like to play in this event again, but I have a couple of specific goals for next year already if I do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to be much better at all the instruments I would play in it (recorder, flute, tin whistle).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to be proficient and confident enough to sit by a microphone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to do some solos, with stylistically appropriate improvisations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe I should learn some of the dances and perform some too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I think tin whistle is particularly suitable for the music in question, I&amp;rsquo;d like to get a better one and work on playing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, right now I am bushed, and am taking a rest from this music, but I&amp;rsquo;ll think about it again after a month or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;thank-yous&#34;&gt;Thank yous&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank Lynette, Donna, Allison, and Maro for all they&amp;rsquo;ve done for this annual Holiday Ball Orchestra over the years, and their openness and friendliness to new participants like me. I had a lot of fun exploring music new to me, and learning to play it and feel it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank the dancers for enjoying and showing appreciation for our playing for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, I would like to thank my wife Abby for encouraging me to join her in playing for the Holiday Ball!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-of-2012-12-14&#34;&gt;(Update of 2012-12-14)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following year, I &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/12/14/pittsburgh-contras-and-squares-holiday-ball-2012/&#34;&gt;played music again in the annual Holiday Ball&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So on this blog I&amp;rsquo;ve already written about &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/recorder/&#34;&gt;starting to play recorder&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, then taking up &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/flute/&#34;&gt;flute again&lt;/a&gt;, and even just barely getting started with &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/baroque-flute/&#34;&gt;Baroque flute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I started playing the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_whistle&#34;&gt;tin whistle&lt;/a&gt; for the first time ever!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This basic cheap &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.feadog.ie/&#34;&gt;Feadóg&lt;/a&gt; tin whistle is the one I am currently using (Abby picked it up at some point years ago while in Ireland, and I dug it out of a box in the basement yesterday).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Feadóg tin whistle&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Why on earth am I playing this thing, which looks like a toy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;upcoming-performance-at-the-holiday-ball&#34;&gt;Upcoming performance at the Holiday Ball&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned in an earlier blog post that I am going to be &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/12/01/im-going-to-perform-music-much-sooner-than-i-expected-monday/&#34;&gt;performing music&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://pittsburghcontra.org/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Contras and Squares&lt;/a&gt; annual Holiday Ball (coming up Friday). I have been &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/12/05/busy-evening-performing-at-phipps-followed-by-rehearsal-for-another-gig/&#34;&gt;practicing hard&lt;/a&gt;, trying to get up to speed on playing the music on either recorder or flute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;practical-considerations&#34;&gt;Practical considerations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had early on decided that I wanted to try to play the flute instead of the recorder in order to get a bigger sound than I would with a recorder (since there will be around thirty musicians total playing, including a whole lot of loud fiddles, accordions, brass). I also wanted to use this goal as a nudge to get better at flute generally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as a beginner, frankly, at flute (I played only aimlessly in the past as a pre-teen), I&amp;rsquo;ve been finding it quite difficult to play all these Irish &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jig&#34;&gt;jigs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reel_(dance)&#34;&gt;reels&lt;/a&gt; at full speed. OK, after one week of practice I can say that I find it &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt; at this point to play these at full speed on flute. Part of the reason is that the music is almost all in keys with sharps, and I find it much easier to play music on the flute with flats (which is all I did as a child).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/09/29/a-musicians-best-friend/&#34;&gt;metronome method&lt;/a&gt; of gradually improving my speed while working on getting things right at a slower speed, but even after a week, for example, I progressed on the Chorus Jig (check out the video of sample &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69BzrCkEvdU&#34;&gt;fiddle rendition&lt;/a&gt;) from metronome marking 78 to 80 to 90 and to 100, but I can&amp;rsquo;t go any faster than yet, for just this one of around &lt;em&gt;thirty&lt;/em&gt; pieces on the program! (I&amp;rsquo;m guessing from our rehearsals that we will be playing at 110 or faster.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried switching back to soprano recorder but it is all still pretty difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;enter-the-tin-whistle&#34;&gt;Enter the tin whistle&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also became dissatisfied with the &amp;ldquo;heaviness&amp;rdquo; of the flute in playing this kind of music (music I have never been familiar with, actually). When I discovered that the soprano recorder sounded pretty good in one of the pieces I tried it on, I wondered what the &amp;ldquo;authentic&amp;rdquo; ways to play this kind of music were. I looked on YouTube, of course, and found no shortage of professional and (mostly) amateur performances of jigs and reels on recorders, Irish flutes, and tin whistles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tin whistle is an authentic instrument for this Irish dance music!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the first rehearsal, Jim had suggested I play tin whistle, and I had thought he was joking, but Abby said she had one, and I vaguely remembered her showing it to me once. So yesterday I dug up the tin whistle, and Abby even found a two-volume instructional method for it of Irish tunes. I didn&amp;rsquo;t use the method, since I already have Irish tunes to play, but I spent an hour learning the fingering (which turns out to be pretty similar to the Baroque flute&amp;rsquo;s, both based on D major) and watching and trying to follow along with some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.whistletutor.com/&#34;&gt;good videos online&lt;/a&gt; I found through a Web search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, what I really wanted to learn was the authentic style, involving various forms of embellishment and articulation. I learned about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.whistletutor.com/lessons/intermediate&#34;&gt;taps, cuts, rolls, slides, etc.&lt;/a&gt; and started trying to experiment with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a lot of fun spending an hour on that yesterday, but one single hour on a new instrument and new musical style isn&amp;rsquo;t enough. If I played a tune slowly, I could add some appropriate embellishments, but I had a hard time playing anything fast at all. I know I could be much better after two weeks, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have two weeks. I have till Friday. I will see what I can do in four days of practice on the tin whistle!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;today-s-final-rehearsal&#34;&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s final rehearsal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This afternoon, Abby and I went to the final rehearsal for the Holiday Ball. I brought my various instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a tough time because there was music I hadn&amp;rsquo;t even seen yet, much less sight read, that will be on the program. This music goes at breakneck speed, and I felt pretty helpless. I figure I will sit out of what I can&amp;rsquo;t play, or just contribute with some notes to provide support to the chords. Tomorrow I will map out a plan, to figure out what I can play, on what instrument, and what to sit out of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dancing-at-the-holiday-ball&#34;&gt;Dancing at the Holiday Ball&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since so many musicians are expected to gather to play on Friday, and seating space is limited, we were asked whether any of us were interested in only playing for the first or second half of the program. Abby and I volunteered to play just the first half. So I&amp;rsquo;ll have less music to try to go over before Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby is interested in dancing with me during the second half. I&amp;rsquo;ve never done contra dancing in my life. I suppose I should be a good sport and give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-of-2012-10-07&#34;&gt;(Update of 2012-10-07)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that at the holiday ball, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/12/16/playing-recorder-and-flute-at-the-holiday-ball/&#34;&gt;I ended up deciding not to dance at all, but just played music&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But 10 months later, Abby and I did do a full contra dance workshop for my first time! &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/10/07/my-first-contra-dance-workshop-unexpected-fun/&#34;&gt;And it was a lot of fun&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-future&#34;&gt;The future&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am amused and grateful that by accident I have come to yet another musical instrument of interest, the tin whistle. I will try to get better at it this week for the Holiday Ball, but I have to confess that I don&amp;rsquo;t know what I&amp;rsquo;ll do with it outside of that context. I don&amp;rsquo;t exactly go around playing Irish dance music. As far as my musical goals are concerned: I&amp;rsquo;d like to return to my long-term project of improving a lot on the modern flute in the coming months, and continuing my recorder improvement as well. I will put Baroque flute on hold for a while, till maybe spring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other instruments also, but time is so limited. Some time ago, I only barely got started on &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/accordion/&#34;&gt;accordion&lt;/a&gt; and have no idea when I&amp;rsquo;ll return to that. Also I started up on piano again, but have put that aside again. I have a ukulele that I have barely started on, but Abby and I seem to be meeting people who are getting into it lately, so at least I know that if I wanted to take it up, there would be a local community to tap into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figure that to get good eventually and rapidly at any instrument, I need to spend at least half an hour a day on average of practice, and I cannot really spend more than an hour a day total on music right now, so that means working on no more than two instruments at a time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
