&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I attended a fascinating and illuminating lecture by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.music.pitt.edu/faculty/newton&#34;&gt;Neil Newton&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Pittsburgh with the title &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.music.pitt.edu/events/lecture-neil-newton-university-pitt130925&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;The Inner Life of Harmonies: An Examination of the Middle Voice in Pop, Classical, and Early Post-Tonal Music&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big question I&amp;rsquo;ve sometimes asked myself is, what is &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atonality&#34;&gt;atonal&lt;/a&gt; music anyway? How do we make sense of it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neil Newton provided what seemed to me an interesting explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;atonal-music-is-not-random-but-has-order&#34;&gt;Atonal music is not random but has order!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atonality&#34;&gt;atonal&lt;/a&gt; music because of how, when successful, when I enjoy it and it somehow &amp;ldquo;makes sense&amp;rdquo; (which it does not always), it falls between the boundaries of order and chaos, like a dream. Also, I should emphasize that I like to make a clear distinction between truly atonal music and the serial (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-tone_technique&#34;&gt;twelve-tone&lt;/a&gt;) music that Schönberg invented after he became dissatisfied with his atonal experiments. Serial music, unlike atonal music, is very strictly organized through a mathematical system; atonal music was its &amp;ldquo;freer&amp;rdquo; predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t listen much to atonal music, but there is some atonal music &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/09/25/thank-you-glenn-gould/&#34;&gt;I have mentioned enjoying, by Schönberg&lt;/a&gt;. So it was with great interest that I attended this lecture trying to explain how atonal music can be understood not as being devoid of traditional harmonic relationships, but rather as embodying a different kind of relationship, a different kind of order. It is not random or chaotic, just ordered differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;substitution-of-a-different-kind-of-order&#34;&gt;Substitution of a different kind of order&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main idea Newton explored was that of finding a replacement for the dominant-tonic relationship that is key in tonal music for &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tension_%28music%29&#34;&gt;tension&lt;/a&gt; and resolution&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;charge and discharge&amp;rdquo; (his preferred terminology). For example, he argues that the interval of a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritone&#34;&gt;tritone&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;code&gt;ic6&lt;/code&gt;) in conjunction with &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_leading&#34;&gt;voice leading&lt;/a&gt; can be used to generate functional movement and therefore build up structural significance that is analogous to the kind of structure significance that exists in tonal music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Particularly interesting to me was how Newton used statistical analysis to look for correlations and patterns in the music he studied and justify his thesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, he unifies his ideas with application to other &amp;ldquo;weird&amp;rdquo; musical phenomenon, such as that found in many pop and rock songs that violate the traditional tonal system. (The music of the Beatles, for example, was quite marked in its oddity.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For details, check out Newton&amp;rsquo;s paper, &lt;a href=&#34;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/musa.12018/abstract&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;An Aspect of Functional Harmony in Schoenberg&amp;rsquo;s Early Post-Tonal Music&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. I don&amp;rsquo;t pretend to understand more than a fraction of what he tries to show, since I am just an amateur musician, not a trained theorist, but the overview and audio examples he gave in his lecture gave me a glimpse of what he&amp;rsquo;s doing, and I was happy to have attended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-of-2014-05-28&#34;&gt;(Update of 2014-05-28)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pitt music department blog &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.music.pitt.edu/blog/neil-newton-schoenberg140528&#34;&gt;just mentioned Newton&amp;rsquo;s work&lt;/a&gt; and provided a link to an &lt;a href=&#34;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.1111/musa.12018/&#34;&gt;enhanced HTML version of his paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s great that serious work continues in trying to understand what lies underneath music that we intuitively enjoy but find odd because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t obey the usual expectations of traditional tonality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reflections on Richard Wagner&#39;s 200th birthday: beautiful music without a future</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/05/22/reflections-on-richard-wagners-200th-birthday/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2013 08:14:55 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/05/22/reflections-on-richard-wagners-200th-birthday/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago, I was driving and had the radio on and heard Richard Wagner&amp;rsquo;s prelude to act 1 of his opera &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Meistersinger_von_N%C3%BCrnberg&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Die Meistersinger&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, and was transported into the lush musical world that is so uniquely Wagner: seductive orchestral colors, chromatic harmony, melodic motifs, fine storytelling, stirring climaxes, and in this particular musical excerpt, ironic yet clever use of counterpoint. I had to pull over for a while to finish listening to the prelude and fully enjoy the &lt;em&gt;guilty&lt;/em&gt; rush of emotional excitement in this fun but over-the-top piece. Why the guilt?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;controversy&#34;&gt;Controversy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The controversial music composer &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wagner&#34;&gt;Richard Wagner&lt;/a&gt; was born 200 years ago. In keeping with the media&amp;rsquo;s love of arbitrarily nice round numbers and anniversaries, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of commentary about celebrations of his birthdays or reasons &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to celebrate. Here are just a few articles that came up during a Web search:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/germany-celebrates-200th-birthday-of-composer-richard-wagner/2013/05/22/b8f93924-c2b2-11e2-9642-a56177f1cdf7_story.html?tid=pm_entertainment_pop&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Germany celebrates 200th birthday of Richard Wagner, Hitler&amp;rsquo;s favorite composer&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2013/05/22/barbara-kay-if-you-must-listen-to-wagner-do-it-in-private/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you must listen to Wagner, do it in private&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.towntopics.com/wordpress/2013/05/22/whistling-in-the-dark-on-wagners-200th-birthday/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Whistling in the dark on Wagner&amp;rsquo;s 200th birthday&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://jessicamusic.blogspot.com/2013/05/dear-richard-i-need-to-tell-you.html&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dear Richard, I need to tell you something&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2013/05/wagner-bicentennial-birthday-music-recordings.html&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;A Wagner birthday roast&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this commentary actually addresses my mixed feelings about Wagner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;wagner-s-anti-semitism&#34;&gt;Wagner&amp;rsquo;s anti-Semitism?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the commentary touches upon Wagner&amp;rsquo;s anti-Semitism and Adolf Hitler&amp;rsquo;s use of Wagner in Germany for Nazi purposes. I will &lt;em&gt;not be discussing&lt;/em&gt; these (important) issues because others already do, and because I tend toward the view that people are imperfect and I would like to be able to assess their important and good work even if they could be judged as unpleasant or downright evil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;love-the-music-hate-the-man&#34;&gt;Love the music, hate the man?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I also do not agree with the sentiment of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/on-the-200th-anniversary-of-wagners-birth-lets-learn-to-love-the-music--yet-still-hate-the-man-8614155.html&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s learn to love the music, yet still hate the man&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. I don&amp;rsquo;t think there is a total separation between Wagner&amp;rsquo;s music and everything else about him. In Wagner&amp;rsquo;s case, in particular, he specifically designed his music around a certain philosophy about the world, about &lt;em&gt;art&lt;/em&gt;. And that is what I really find interesting and unsettling, somewhat along the lines of Friedrich Nietzsche&amp;rsquo;s critique of his one-time friend, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Case_of_Wagner&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Case of Wagner&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nietzsche_contra_Wagner&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nietzsche contra Wagner&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;music-and-philosophy&#34;&gt;Music and philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wagner&amp;rsquo;s philosophizing about the nature of and purpose of music embraced the notion of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesamtkunstwerk&#34;&gt;Gesamtkunstwerk&lt;/a&gt;, the &amp;ldquo;total work of art&amp;rdquo;, that would unify all the arts, hence his development of his form of opera, the &amp;ldquo;music drama&amp;rdquo;, whose purpose was to unify music, poetry, theater in a grand and serious spectacle to inspire the audience. He proposed the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_the_Future&#34;&gt;Zukunftsmusik&lt;/a&gt;, or &amp;ldquo;music of the future&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;modernism&#34;&gt;Modernism?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Wagner&amp;rsquo;s day in the late 19th century, there was &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Romantics&#34;&gt;fierce rivalry among the German Romantics&lt;/a&gt; on the direction of musical evolution. Roughly, there was the camp of Johannes Brahms (whose &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/05/07/happy-birthday-johannes-brahms/&#34;&gt;birthday I celebrated a few weeks ago&lt;/a&gt;, considered &amp;ldquo;conservative&amp;rdquo;, and the camp of Wagner, which considered itself &amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo;. Aspects of this &amp;ldquo;war&amp;rdquo; seem quaint and exaggerated now, and Brahms has been &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.economist.com/node/367351&#34;&gt;re-evaluated&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/29/arts/old-brahms-a-modernist-in-more-ways-than-one.html&#34;&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.americansymphony.org/concert_notes/the-other-voice-of-johannes-brahms&#34;&gt;decades&lt;/a&gt;, and the big tent of Western art music has historically learned from both camps&amp;rsquo; methods and sensibilities, but Wagner, at least, took very seriously his own self-importance and self-promotion as an artist/philosopher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting question to me is, what is Wagner&amp;rsquo;s relationship to &lt;em&gt;modernism&lt;/em&gt;, both in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernism_%28music%29&#34;&gt;musical sense&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernism&#34;&gt;more general sense&lt;/a&gt;, typically applied to the late 19th century and early 20th century trends in literature, art, architecture, and society that are still relevant today?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tristan&#34;&gt;Tristan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.guardian.co.uk/friday_review/story/0,,381181,00.html&#34;&gt;harmonic and other innovations&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_und_Isolde&#34;&gt;Tristan und Isolde&lt;/a&gt; in 1865 (it is arguable that Franz Liszt was the real innovator first) can be considered the beginning of modernism in music (in the sense of dissolution of Western tonality). Check out this performance of the beginning of the prelude to act 1 along with a score annotated with harmonic analysis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/Pwk3BKipjtQ&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my favorite full performance of the prelude as well as the final sung Liebestod, by the great Wilhelm Furtwängler conducting and Kirsted Flagstad singing. It truly blew my mind when I first discovered and heard this music while in college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/SQO7QIgNvA0&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;who-claims-modernism&#34;&gt;Who claims modernism?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the modernist &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Viennese_School&#34;&gt;Second Viennese School&lt;/a&gt; under Arnold Schönberg liked to claim Brahms as one of their own, and in even more revisionism recently, there have been attempts to situate &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/modernism-after-wagner&#34;&gt;Wagner as the inspiration for modernism in the larger sense&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(A few of my notes about Schönberg &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/09/25/thank-you-glenn-gould/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Also, it is too large a topic for now, but I plan to write more later about modernism and postmodernism and post-postmodernism in music, in the context of today&amp;rsquo;s music and in my own experience of music, whether listening or performing.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;wagner-s-legacy&#34;&gt;Wagner&amp;rsquo;s legacy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe Wagner failed, that his philosophy was a dead end, and that his music was a dead end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This despite the fact that, of course, he changed the course of Western musical history, both by provoking the modernist backlash against his theatricalism and chromaticism, while paving the way for, say, Mahler and Bruckner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have enjoyed and continue to occasionally listen again to marvelous music by Wagner, but &lt;em&gt;not in the way he intended&lt;/em&gt;. I have never attended a performance of one of his operas. I have only seen (on TV or video) or listened to bits of his operas that are sung (rather than purely instrumental excerpts). Two decades ago, I did try to watch the mammoth &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Ring_des_Nibelungen&#34;&gt;Ring cycle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/18/arts/review-television-taking-the-17-hour-plunge-with-wagner-s-ring-at-the-met.html&#34;&gt;broadcast on TV by the Metropolitan Opera&lt;/a&gt; over four long evenings, but my attention span allowed me to only drift in and out of consciousness periodically during that attempt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most damning of all is that shortly after that TV experience, I rather enjoyed listening to Lorin Maazel&amp;rsquo;s album, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/music/dp/B000003CUJ&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Ring Without Words&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, basically showing that for me, Wagner totally failed as a philosopher, because I like his music best without the &amp;ldquo;poetry&amp;rdquo; (his lyrics, which he wrote himself, don&amp;rsquo;t make much sense to me) and without the on-stage drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even then, I cannot listen to his music much without feeling unclean. There is a sense in which I cannot separate his music from his philosophy and his wider artistic and cultural aims. Even if he had not been an anti-Semite, there should be controversy over him and his legacy. There is a sense in which I agree with some of the old-fashioned concerns about his music: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/may/22/wagner-bad-for-your-mental-health&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wagner as mental health menace?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. In Nietzsche&amp;rsquo;s words, Wagner and his music are &lt;em&gt;decadent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-of-2014-07-13&#34;&gt;(Update of 2014-07-13)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2014/07/13/what-i-remember-lorin-maazel-for/&#34;&gt;RIP, Lorin Maazel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;music-is-powerful&#34;&gt;Music is powerful&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s pretty delicious decadence. Last month a friend splurged on going to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://ringcycle.metoperafamily.org/&#34;&gt;Metropolitan Opera&amp;rsquo;s performance of the Ring&lt;/a&gt;, and I decided to indulge in listening to Siegfried&amp;rsquo;s funeral march in &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6tterd%C3%A4mmerung&#34;&gt;Götterdämmerung&lt;/a&gt;. As usual, the experience left me in tears. Wagner, master psychologist, master manipulator of emotions, master composer, weaving the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitmotif&#34;&gt;leitmotifs&lt;/a&gt;, summing up the whole tragic story of the Ring:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/L8wHteSOwW4&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for sheer &lt;em&gt;hypnotism&lt;/em&gt;, listen to Furtwängler again, with the prelude to act 1 of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lohengrin_%28opera%29&#34;&gt;Lohengrin&lt;/a&gt;. Close your eyes, turn out the lights, and listen. Beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/I_m7PN5sn1U&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More hypnosis: prelude to act 1 of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsifal&#34;&gt;Parsifal&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen an old Furtwängler performance again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/EZhSUX5Ix68&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;back-to-die-meistersinger&#34;&gt;Back to Die Meistersinger&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, to end where I started, with the prelude to act 1 of Die Meistersinger that I happened to enjoy on the radio, here is Furtwängler again, conducting a performance of it live. &lt;strong&gt;Warning: this is a video of a live performance in 1942 in Germany with swastikas in the background, so you may not wish to view this.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/3rM96_RS1Os&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, this video is totally creepy, but I thought it would be appropriate to close on this jarring note. Die Meistersinger was, after all, Wagner&amp;rsquo;s telling of a story to glorify old Germany, and was a favorite opera of the Nazis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(And the subject of Furtwängler, a conductor I have many mixed feelings about, will have to wait for another blog post as well.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot help but admire and be affected by Wagner&amp;rsquo;s music, but at the same time feel that his entire philosophy and aim was bankrupt. I&amp;rsquo;ve touched on only a little bit of how I have come to feel this, since the larger issues go beyond Wagner, but I don&amp;rsquo;t yet have complete thoughts and rationales to offer at this time. As with the towering figure of Beethoven, his musical and cultural legacy is still controversial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;postscript&#34;&gt;Postscript&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided I wanted to end more positively. My favorite piece of Wagner&amp;rsquo;s is one that was actually always intended to be purely instrumental and is self-contained, not just an excerpt: the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siegfried_Idyll&#34;&gt;Siegfried Idyll&lt;/a&gt;. Oh wait, again we all subvert his intention anyway, because he composed it for his wife Cosima&amp;rsquo;s birthday (what a beautiful present to wake up to in the morning) and only ever intended it to be performed privately!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furtwängler again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/_jlzEFg-zkY&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-of-2014-07-11&#34;&gt;(Update of 2014-07-11)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just saw yet another article about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newrepublic.com/article/118331/forbidden-music-michael-haas-reviewed-james-loeffler&#34;&gt;Wagner and anti-Semitism&lt;/a&gt;. The topic never goes anyway, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think it should. That said, I don&amp;rsquo;t personally have anything to add to the discussion, but offer the link if you feel you need to engage further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This book was written from the conviction that understanding music does not come from memorizing an esoteric code. ([Charles Rosen, *Music and Sentiment*, 2010](http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300126402).)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I heard that the noted pianist and musical scholar &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Rosen&#34;&gt;Charles Rosen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/2012/12/10/166876593/remembering-charles-rosen-a-prodigious-pianist-and-polymath&#34;&gt;died at 85 yesterday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I type these words while his book of this year (2012), &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674047525&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Freedom and the Arts&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; is visible on my book shelf next to my computer: I had taken it out of the library a while back. I own copies of several of his previous books, starting with his famous [&amp;ldquo;The Classical Style&amp;rdquo;] which was my introduction to his thinking about music. I also own a number of his piano recordings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply, &lt;strong&gt;Charles Rosen changed the entire course of my life&lt;/strong&gt;. Without him, my life would have been completely different, and I would have been a completely different person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t actually remember exactly how I came across Rosen&amp;rsquo;s writings. Here is what I remember about the context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;freshman-year-in-college&#34;&gt;Freshman year in college&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned before that I &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/11/09/taking-up-flute-again-after-decades/&#34;&gt;entered freshman year in college having very little musical background&lt;/a&gt;, either as a listener or as a performer, but in order to fulfill a core requirement, in my first semester took an &amp;ldquo;easy&amp;rdquo; music appreciation course called &amp;ldquo;Piano Music of the 19th Century&amp;rdquo;. I also made a new friend in my dorm during freshman week, who happened to be a big fan of Mozart and lent me some of his recordings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, freshman year in college was the year when I fell in love with music all over again, having mostly ignored it after my middle school disasters in music class and band class. Because I made some new friends (from my math and science classes) who were heavily into classical music, I ended up listening to their collections and getting into it myself. Since one of them was a fan of Mozart and the other of Beethoven, it was natural that I became very familiar with music of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_period_(music)&#34;&gt;Classical period&lt;/a&gt;, focused on the late 18th century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;accidental-discovery-of-rosen&#34;&gt;Accidental discovery of Rosen&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point before sophomore year, I must have seen Rosen&amp;rsquo;s book &amp;ldquo;The Classical Style&amp;rdquo; in a local book store and browsed it and found it sufficiently engaging and approachable to buy it. I liked that he combined both readable text as well as excerpts from scores and actual music theoretic analysis. In order to understand better the analysis, of course, I had to learn some music theory, and I eventually ended up taking a two-semester &amp;ldquo;non-majors&amp;rdquo; course on music theory. But the book was readable even without much theoretical knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;making-me-think&#34;&gt;Making me think&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Rosen&amp;rsquo;s book did for me was that it made me &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; about music, and also about a lot more than music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d had a year in college of listening to a lot of music for enjoyment, but felt I wanted to &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; more of what I &lt;em&gt;felt&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;experienced&lt;/em&gt; intuitively. Rosen explained things about how the Classical era&amp;rsquo;s music was very different from the Baroque that preceded it and also very different from the Romantic era&amp;rsquo;s that followed it. He talked about musical forms and structures, the emergent harmonic language, as well as contemporary changes in society, in philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came away from the book with a much better understanding of various ongoing debates about composer &amp;ldquo;intent&amp;rdquo;, about whether some music is &amp;ldquo;better&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;more advanced&amp;rdquo; than others, about whether old music should be played on modern instruments, about culture in general. I didn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily adopt Rosen&amp;rsquo;s opinions about things, but enjoyed that he provided reasons for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-books&#34;&gt;Other books&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I picked up several new books by Rosen as they appeared. Here are examples of what I learned from two of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;frontiers-of-meaning&#34;&gt;Frontiers of Meaning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1994 slim volume &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Frontiers-Meaning-Charles-Rosen/dp/187108265X&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Frontiers of Meaning&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; was interesting because Rosen argued that music has &amp;ldquo;meaning&amp;rdquo; and offered his own personal story about changes in his musical taste and understanding. The big message was that if we don&amp;rsquo;t understand a piece of music, we would do well &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to immediately dismiss it as junk or noise, but try to understand it on its own terms, and maybe even end up actually enjoying it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rosen notes that although he found the string quartets of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Bart%C3%B3k&#34;&gt;Béla Bartók&lt;/a&gt; harsh and incomprehensible at first, he came to like one of them a lot. He still never ended up liking a different one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the takeaway message from the book was that if we want to enjoy life, and enjoy as much music as we can, we should open ourselves up to new possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;arnold-schönberg&#34;&gt;Arnold Schönberg&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another memorable book was a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Arnold-Schoenberg-Charles-Rosen/dp/0226726436&#34;&gt;1996 book on Arnold Schönberg&lt;/a&gt; that was really fascinating in its discussion of this controversial composer and theoretician. Rosen portrayed Schönberg as a unifier of the past as well as creator of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/09/25/thank-you-glenn-gould/&#34;&gt;mentioned before&lt;/a&gt;, I still do not enjoy much of Schönberg&amp;rsquo;s music, but thanks to Rosen, I understand where he was coming from, and I think that is important. I also better understand why I like the music of his I like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;recordings&#34;&gt;Recordings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I went out of my way to obtain some rare recordings of Charles Rosen himself playing piano, such as the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Late-Piano-Sonatas-Charles-Rosen/dp/B00000291P&#34;&gt;late Beethoven piano sonatas&lt;/a&gt;, to test how his interpretations matched what I imagined they would be, from his discussions in his books. I was surprised by some interpretive decisions, and not all of them &amp;ldquo;worked&amp;rdquo; for me, but I felt a sense of satisfaction that here was a guy who not only thought about and wrote about music, but performed it also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-obituaries&#34;&gt;Some obituaries&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/11/arts/music/charles-rosen-pianist-polymath-and-author-dies-at-85.html&#34;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;breadth&lt;/em&gt; of Charles Rosen&amp;rsquo;s interests and knowledge was one of the most appealing features of his work: he talked about music theory, piano performance, art, philosophy. I&amp;rsquo;ll miss his presence as an analyst and cultural commentator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-of-2013-03-11&#34;&gt;(Update of 2013-03-11)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An entertaining &lt;a href=&#34;http://standpointmag.co.uk/music-march-13-a-fusion-of-piano-and-cerebellum-norman-lebrecht-charles-rosen&#34;&gt;article by Norman Lebrecht&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-of-2013-05-22&#34;&gt;(Update of 2013-05-22)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of future discussions of the influence of Charles Rosen on my thought, I felt I should mention that what he introduced me to was a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernism_%28music%29&#34;&gt;modernist&lt;/a&gt; sensibility that, while unapologetic, was also honest and not rigid or doctrinaire. I respected that, given my ambivalence about the modernist philosophy and attitude, an ambivalence I still have two decades after first reading him (I do not consider myself a modernist). As mentioned, this modernist sensibility is at odds with aspects of Romanticism, which had been my default sensibility until I started immersing myself in the music of the Classical era.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Today would have been the 80th birthday of the eccentric Canadian pianist &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Gould&#34;&gt;Glenn Gould&lt;/a&gt;, who actually died at age 50 in 1982, before I ever knew about him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was nice to see an article about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/2012/09/25/160957849/glenn-gould-beyond-bachs-goldberg-variations&#34;&gt;Gould playing music other than the Bach he is mostly known for&lt;/a&gt;. Not surprisingly, my own first exposure to Glenn Gould was through his recordings of the music of Bach. I was an undergraduate and one of my friends was a big fan of Gould&amp;rsquo;s and shared some recordings with me, including both the 1955 and 1982 recordings of the Goldberg Variations, and I was hooked by his uniquely quirky, rhythmic style. But my friend, being such a Gould fan, also had recordings of Gould playing anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I had mixed feelings about almost all of his recordings, because he so imposed his personal notions of how he wanted composers&amp;rsquo; music to sound; sometimes I could not tell whether he was being serious or being deliberately annoying, because there was so much I &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; and so much I &lt;em&gt;hated&lt;/em&gt;. He was never just plain solid and boring: there was no middle of the road for him. He brought his full love or boredom to everything he did. Much of his Mozart and Beethoven were terrible, to my ears (while some of it pretty good). His Brahms was uneven. Actually, much of what he did was simply &lt;em&gt;perverse&lt;/em&gt;, for lack of a better word. But in any case, I love that Gould did what he felt compelled to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;arnold-schönberg&#34;&gt;Arnold Schönberg&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Arnold_Schoenberg_la_1948.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Arnold Schönberg&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Fascinatingly, it was through Glenn Gould that I came to enjoy (some of) the music of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schoenberg&#34;&gt;Arnold Schönberg&lt;/a&gt;. I have to confess that I don&amp;rsquo;t (yet?) understand or like Schönberg&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-tone_technique&#34;&gt;twelve-tone&lt;/a&gt; music, but I rather enjoy his very brief free &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atonality&#34;&gt;atonal&lt;/a&gt; piano music, which Gould played with such love that it reflected the late &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Romanticism&#34;&gt;German romantic&lt;/a&gt; roots and sensibilities that were Schönberg&amp;rsquo;s heritage. The three &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drei_Klavierst%C3%BCcke&#34;&gt;Klavierstücke Op. 11&lt;/a&gt;, that I discovered purely from browsing through Gould&amp;rsquo;s recordings as lent to me in college, are beautiful and expressive works, deeply &lt;em&gt;emotional&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite of the three are the first and second, because the third is too violent and chaotic for me to really enjoy. As an undergrad, the second was my favorite, but now the first is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can click on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/2012/09/25/160957849/glenn-gould-beyond-bachs-goldberg-variations&#34;&gt;the link to the article&lt;/a&gt; to listen to the track of Gould playing No. 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it is not an accident that Gould took to this music, because I perceive him also to be a paradoxical &lt;em&gt;Romantic&lt;/em&gt; at heart who superficially seemed to reject Romanticism, for Romantic reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-recordings&#34;&gt;Other recordings&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://www.bruceduffie.com/pollini8.jpg&#34; /&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Maurizio Pollini&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Actually, since my first discovery of this music, I prefer other performances to those of Gould. I like &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurizio_Pollini&#34;&gt;Maurizio Pollini&lt;/a&gt;: below are performances of all three by him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/DUHn7knkrLc&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I celebrated Glenn Gould&amp;rsquo;s birthday not by playing any of his Bach recordings I have, but by enjoying him playing Schönberg and other composers, and listening to others also play Schönberg. I am grateful to Gould for all he did to share with the world his personal approach to music.&lt;/p&gt;
