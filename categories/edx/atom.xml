    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;By coincidence, it is now &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smithsonianjazz.org/&#34;&gt;Jazz Appreciation Month&lt;/a&gt;, which is observed every April. So it is fitting that I just completed the free MOOC from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.edx.org/&#34;&gt;edX&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.edx.org/course/utaustinx/utaustinx-ut-8-01x-jazz-appreciation-1149&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Jazz Appreciation&amp;rdquo;, UT.8.01X&lt;/a&gt;, through UT Austin, taught by Jeffrey Hellmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intro video:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/dp9I1cM0fGA&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was good and bad in this course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-survey&#34;&gt;A survey&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course was a low-stress way to get a little survey of jazz. I&amp;rsquo;ve never formally studied jazz nor systematically read up on its history, so all that I know comes purely from random personal listening, more than anything else. I don&amp;rsquo;t consider myself a &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; jazz aficionado; I know a whole lot more about classical music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought it was a good idea to start with 1950s hard bop rather than go in chronological order through history, and then work backwards and forwards from there, because of the accessibility and typicality of the jazz from this era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked how the instructor illustrated concepts at the piano, and brought up issues of artistic differences without judgment and getting into controversies that still exist today. He basically said, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to like everything you hear in this course, but know how to identify and compare the stylistic features and goals. There&amp;rsquo;s a reason musicians chose to go in the directions they did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cerego-quizzes&#34;&gt;Cerego quizzes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cerego quiz platform was the most annoying thing about the course. I thought it was counterproductive busywork. In fact, I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I tolerated it just to complete the course; it was a waste of time to have done so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You had to demonstrate &amp;ldquo;mastery&amp;rdquo; of isolated facts, through identifying musical snippets, classifying the eras of musicians, memorizing what instruments they played, etc. I can see some point in some mastery of some facts, but the sheer repetition and shallowness of the concept bothered me. It got to the point where I made a game of identifying a musical selection based on hearing the first quarter second of its audio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-learned&#34;&gt;What I learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I didn&amp;rsquo;t learn that much from the course, because I&amp;rsquo;ve already done my share of listening to jazz. I filled in a few gaps, but not in any deep way. Unfortunately, a course like this must be shallow. You might learn a few names, hear some musical snippets, and then it&amp;rsquo;s purely up to you to go investigate more if you want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-drawback-of-a-survey-course&#34;&gt;The drawback of a survey course&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure whether to recommend a course like this if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in learning more about jazz. I believe it may be more enjoyable and instructive to simply pick a few favorite artists and listen deeply. A shallow survey simply cannot do much. I feel this way about survey courses on any subject, whether ballroom dancing, programming languages, or cooking. It&amp;rsquo;s best to just go deep, and then later fill in gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-followup&#34;&gt;My followup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, one thing I did do as a result of this course was that the instructor mentioned resources such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://tedgioia.com/&#34;&gt;Ted Gioia&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s writings on jazz, and so I went and read his book from 1988, &lt;a href=&#34;http://tedgioia.com/TheImperfectArt.html&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Imperfect Art&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. I loved it, and it clarified for me some things I had been thinking about regarding the nature of jazz. I may write about this later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t actually read much music criticism any more, but if you want to read about jazz, Ted Gioia is definitely one guy to read. For example, check out his recent article &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/18/music-criticism-has-degenerated-into-lifestyle-reporting.html&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Music criticism has degenerated into lifestyle reporting&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Free course review: Software Engineering for Software as a Service (Part I), from Coursera</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So after putting quite a bit of time, from February 20 to March 23, into the free Coursera course &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.saas-class.org/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Software Engineering for Software as a Service (Part I)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, I just received my &amp;ldquo;Statement of Accomplishment&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Congratulations! You have successfully completed the free online offering of Software Engineering for Software as a Service (Part I), offered February to April, 2012. To successfully complete this free online class, students were required to watch lectures, complete quizzes, and do weekly assignments.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My review:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;mooc-explosion&#34;&gt;MOOC explosion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just half a year ago, in the fall of 2011, my life was &lt;em&gt;radically altered&lt;/em&gt; by the introduction of free massive open online courses (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course&#34;&gt;MOOCs&lt;/a&gt;). Eager to learn new skills and ideas of all kinds, I jumped into enrolling in a whole bunch of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went crazy, actually: I took a very heavy load, enrolling in and completing two Stanford MOOCs while doing everything else I was doing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/01/11/experiment-in-learning-completing-stanford-online-course-introduction-to-databases/&#34;&gt;Introduction to Databases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/01/12/experiment-in-learning-completing-stanford-online-course-machine-learning/&#34;&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two courses each lasted for two months, starting in early October and ending in mid-December of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This spring of 2012, I went crazy again and took a very heavy load of two MOOCs, through Coursera:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software Engineering for Software as a Service (Part I) (discussed here)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model Thinking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-on-model-thinking&#34;&gt;(Update on Model Thinking)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/06/16/review-of-coursera-course-model-thinking/&#34;&gt;An incomplete review of Model Thinking.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-did-i-take-this-course&#34;&gt;Why did I take this course?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I signed up for this course in February because I was curious about &lt;a href=&#34;http://rubyonrails.org/&#34;&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt;. I have not done much Web development since the old days of Perl, so I decided to update my skills in this area, which is not what I do in my current job. Also, although I have used some Ruby at my job, I felt that the course would help me deepen my understanding of the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, this course was advertised as not being about Rails so much as about &amp;ldquo;software engineering&amp;rdquo; using the concept of &amp;ldquo;software as a service&amp;rdquo; as a concrete domain. So I was interested in getting my hands dirty in adopting the instructors&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;opinionated&amp;rdquo; idea of an &amp;ldquo;Agile&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;software engineering&amp;rdquo; process for development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;materials&#34;&gt;Materials&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lectures on video were provided. I found them useful but fairly poor in production qualities (sound problems and quite a few in-video quiz glitches). I understand that the instructors may improve these materials, for future offerings of the course, after the scramble of getting everything together for the first trial run of this course!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhat controversially, the instructors&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href=&#34;http://beta.saasbook.info/&#34;&gt;textbook that was still in rough alpha condition&lt;/a&gt; was recommended for the course. Originally I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to buy it, but I found references from the course that made it sound like it would be useful, so I bought it. It was rather poorly formatted and repeated a lot that was already in the lecture videos and slides, but did have additional material. The book was inexpensive enough that its flaws did not annoy me excessively. (Eventually the book finally entered beta!)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://sites.google.com/site/longlastingsoftware/_/rsrc/1366223530547/config/cover.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Book cover&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Confusingly, we were also to watch the &lt;a href=&#34;http://screencast.saasbook.info/&#34;&gt;videos for the book&lt;/a&gt;. Having course material spread out like this was annoying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were told that the course was going to cover about half of the book, and that there might be a second online course offered at some point, to finish the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;coursework&#34;&gt;Coursework&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were quizzes. I experienced glitches in dealing with them. For example, in one of the quizzes, the timer ran down because I started it but then had to attend to something (I was at home in the evening then). When I went back, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t retake the quiz, so I got no credit for anything! It was upsetting, but then again, my goal was to learn, not to get a perfect score in this class. Also, sometimes when I got an answer wrong on a quiz, there was no feedback about what I did wrong! This was quite annoying. The quiz system needs to be significantly improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programming assignments were the heart of the course. They sometimes took quite a long time to complete. There were several reasons for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One was just that Rails is big, and in learning to actually write and deploy Rails applications, I had to get familiar with the online documentation to search for Rails methods to use. Another was the use of Cucumber. It took forever to run Cucumber tests. From reading various online Rails tutorials and articles about testing, it appeared to me that the course instructors&amp;rsquo; testing methodology was suspect, but who was I to complain, since I was just learning all this stuff myself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That leads to the main problem, which is that of spaghetti code: the &amp;ldquo;Rotten Potatoes&amp;rdquo; app that we modified incrementally had logic spread out all over the place. It was very difficult for me to understand what happened where, and what could happen or could not. There were code paths that involved implicit changes of state and hacking in routes and actions. It all felt wrong. Also, I strongly favor statically typed languages, and using Ruby was rather painful for me: you pull attributes out from thin air, stick them into the controller, and then suddenly you have to know you can use them in the view, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-learned&#34;&gt;What I learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned a huge amount, actually. This was the first time I&amp;rsquo;d systematically work through developing an application from the ground up using &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development&#34;&gt;Test-Driven Development&lt;/a&gt; (TDD) and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development&#34;&gt;Behavior-Driven Development&lt;/a&gt;, for example. &lt;strong&gt;I am completely sold on TDD and BDD now.&lt;/strong&gt; It was very useful writing down, in code, scenarios to expect to happen or not happen, before implementing the behavior. I have issues with Cucumber, the tool, but the process itself, I am sold on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also very satisfying incrementally developing a Rails application that actually did something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it was also useful gaining experience using Git and Heroku.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite rough patches in the course (that I hope will be remedied in a future offering), I found that I learned a lot. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in gaining experience incrementally developing an application, and certainly if desiring to get started with Ruby and Rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope there will be a part two of this course offered, to complete the material from the Berkeley course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-of-2013-12-13&#34;&gt;(Update of 2013-12-13)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been almost two years since I took this course, during which I have not done anything with Rails since, although I have started experimenting with using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.playframework.com/&#34;&gt;Play&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scala-lang.org/&#34;&gt;Scala&lt;/a&gt;, which is similar in spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, this course has moved off Coursera to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.edx.org/&#34;&gt;edX&lt;/a&gt; MOOC platform. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.edx.org/course/uc-berkeleyx/uc-berkeleyx-cs-169-2x-software-service-1005&#34;&gt;Part 2 was offered in August 2013&lt;/a&gt; and a revised version of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.edx.org/course/uc-berkeleyx/uc-berkeleyx-cs169-1x-software-service-1136&#34;&gt;part 1 was offered in September 2013&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;ldquo;The presentation order and amount of time spent on some material is being changed in response to feedback from both on-campus and online students. This run of the class also includes all new videos, two new homeworks and all new exam questions. The new class also includes embedded live chat with Teaching Assistants and other students and opportunities for remote pair programming with other students. Group tutorial Q&amp;amp;A sessions will also be held and broadcast live through Google Hangouts and YouTube.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I presume both parts of the course will continue to be offered in the future. I would like to take part 2 at some point, but that depends on what time I can devote to it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
