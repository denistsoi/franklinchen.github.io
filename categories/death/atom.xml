      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2014/01/17/hiroo-onoda-and-the-six-million-dollar-man/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A news article just came my way that fascinated me: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/hiroo-onoda-japanese-soldier-who-hid-in-philippine-jungle-for-29-years-dies-at-91/2014/01/17/7016d806-7f8b-11e3-93c1-0e888170b723_story.html&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hiroo Onoda, Japanese soldier who hid in Philippine jungle for 29 years, dies at 91&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I had long heard of &amp;ldquo;stragglers&amp;rdquo; who did not realize that a war or persecution was over and kept fighting or fleeing, away from &amp;ldquo;civilization&amp;rdquo;, unaware of how the rest of the world was changing. The most recent case of that I read about was a really moving story, astonishing and sad, about an Old Believer &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/for-40-years-this-russian-family-was-cut-off-from-all-human-contact-unaware-of-world-war-ii-7354256/&#34;&gt;Russian family that hid out for forty years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in the case of this Japanese soldier, although I had not earlier read about his particular story, I instantly remembered an old TV episode I watched as a young child that was an astoundingly memorable episode, whose details are etched in my mind. This was &lt;a href=&#34;http://bionic.wikia.com/wiki/The_Last_Kamikaze&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Last Kamikaze&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, an episode of &amp;ldquo;The Six Million Dollar Man&amp;rdquo; TV series that I watched religiously back in the day. This episode was about a Japanese straggler from World War II. &lt;strong&gt;It changed my life forever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-last-kamikaze&#34;&gt;The Last Kamikaze&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazingly, I found the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xtp86d_the-six-million-dollar-man-the-last-kamikaze-jan-19-1975_shortfilms&#34;&gt;whole episode online&lt;/a&gt;. You may want to watch this episode before reading my spoilers below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder=&#34;0&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; height=&#34;270&#34; src=&#34;http://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/xtp86d&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xtp86d_the-six-million-dollar-man-the-last-kamikaze-jan-19-1975_shortfilms&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Six Million Dollar Man&amp;ndash;The Last Kamikaze&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dailymotion.com/dwyerjoss&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;dwyerjoss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;discussion-with-spoilers&#34;&gt;Discussion, with spoilers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It made a profound impact on me when I watched it over 30 years ago. First, there was the exciting action aspect, of course (all the booby traps in the jungle). But mostly, it was in some sense my first exposure to something from Japanese culture, in particular regarding notions of &amp;ldquo;honor&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, it was just TV, and American 1970s TV at a time when there weren&amp;rsquo;t a lot of Asians even being portrayed at all, but in retrospect, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad at all. I was confused by the attempted &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seppuku&#34;&gt;seppuku&lt;/a&gt;, and my parents had to explain what that was about (not being Japanese, but actually living during World War II in Taiwan under Japanese rule and remembering the Allies defeating Japan).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;death-and-life&#34;&gt;Death and life&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the real climax of the episode was when Steve Austin intervenes in the attempt and saves the character Kuroda, saying &amp;ldquo;You have shown that you know how to die. Now for the sake of your enemies, show me that you know how to live.&amp;rdquo; I reflected on what it might mean to &amp;ldquo;know how to die&amp;rdquo; or to &amp;ldquo;know how to live&amp;rdquo;. In that moment of the TV episode, &lt;em&gt;my life was changed forever&lt;/em&gt;. I was around seven years old at the time. I suppose you could say I lost my &amp;ldquo;innocence&amp;rdquo; at that exact moment in time; I became a philosopher then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought a lot about life and death after that episode. What is the meaning of life, or of death? And most of all, what do we choose, and why do we choose? What is honor?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My questioning may have begun at seven, but it has not yet ended. I do not have the final answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that one TV episode got me started on a lifelong philosophical journey. When I was older, I studied the Christian Bible, which is all about exploring what it means to live and die: Jesus dying and living again, and the command to be &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206&#34;&gt;dead to sin but alive in Christ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is also the controversial choice of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates&#34;&gt;Socrates&lt;/a&gt; to commit suicide, which I read various conflicting opinions about: when I had just finished high school, the book &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ifstone.org/trial_of_socrates.php&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Trial of Socrates&amp;rdquo; by I.F. Stone came out&lt;/a&gt; that was very provocative and turned me against Socrates, whom I had earlier considered a hero, from reading Plato&amp;rsquo;s dialogues about him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also bothered but fascinated by the lore that &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha&#34;&gt;Gautama Buddha&lt;/a&gt; deliberately ate rotting food in order not to offend his host, and died as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what of the controversial mass suicide by Jews at &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masada&#34;&gt;Masada&lt;/a&gt;? Or that of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-immolation&#34;&gt;self-immolating&lt;/a&gt; Buddhist monks in Vietnam?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In college, I took a philosophy course by &lt;a href=&#34;http://philosophy.columbia.edu/directories/faculty/frederick-neuhouser&#34;&gt;Frederick Neuhouser&lt;/a&gt; and studied Nietzsche, who had his character Zarathustra say, &lt;a href=&#34;http://4umi.com/nietzsche/zarathustra/21&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Die at the right time&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. I was profoundly affected by the challenges that Nietzsche threw at his readers. That course changed my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very recently, Stoicism has become popularized as a living philosophy for today, with proponents such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ttbook.org/book/transcript/transcript-william-irvine-stoic-life&#34;&gt;William Irvine&lt;/a&gt;, who talks about &amp;ldquo;contemplation of death&amp;rdquo;. I very much enjoyed his book &lt;a href=&#34;http://global.oup.com/academic/product/a-guide-to-the-good-life-9780195374612&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;A Guide to the Good Life: the Ancient Art of Stoic Joy&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; not long after it came out; reading it in early 2011, I changed the course of my life. (Don&amp;rsquo;t forget that &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger&#34;&gt;Seneca&lt;/a&gt; was also forced to commit suicide.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am fascinated by deliberate, reasoned decisions about life and death.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Remembering my Uncle Steve</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/03/16/remembering-my-uncle-steve/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Mar 2012 18:19:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/03/16/remembering-my-uncle-steve/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I got a call from my mother informing me that my Uncle Steve, husband of my mother&amp;rsquo;s sister Aunt Soo-kin, died yesterday. He had been sick for quite some time, and last year, in the hospital for something else, they found cancer in addition, so it was a very tough battle for him, and he was always a fighter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was very grateful for the opportunity in July 2010 to visit Aunt and Uncle in East Lansing when he was still very much active. I had not seen either of them in possibly twenty years; my parents and Abby and I went up to their home, and they got to meet Abby for the very first time (he was not well when we married in 2009).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the only photo I currently have of him (my parents have the family photo album that must have a lot more photos from the past forty years since we&amp;rsquo;ve all been in the United States). (From left to right: Abby, my mother, Aunt Soo-kin, my father, and Uncle Steve.)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Update: my brother-in-law André just sent me some more photos, from the wedding of my sister Linda and him in 2010 that he did manage to attend.)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What do I remember most about Uncle Steve, and how did he impact my life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-visit-in-july-2010&#34;&gt;The visit in July 2010&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncle Steve was full of energy and insisted on taking us around Lansing, giving all of us a tour of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_Capitol&#34;&gt;Michigan State Capitol&lt;/a&gt; as well as the Michigan State University campus, especially the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cpa.msu.edu/beal/&#34;&gt;botanical garden&lt;/a&gt;. He also took us to his favorite Chinese buffet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, typical of him, he had originally planned to get us on a cruise on the river. We had gone down to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lansingcitymarket.com/&#34;&gt;Lansing City Market&lt;/a&gt;, where he bought tickets, but then it turned out that the timing was bad and nothing was available that day, so we had to cancel on the plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;uncle-steve-s-traits&#34;&gt;Uncle Steve&amp;rsquo;s traits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main thing I will always remember about Uncle Steve is how different he was from other relatives. He was very energetic and aggressive, outspoken, adventurous compared to the rest of us. The way he talked, drove, and ate was quite different from how my father behaved, so in my childhood, the contrast between my two main adult male role models was striking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw him (and aunt and their two children, my cousins) more often when I was in elementary school, middle school, high school in Michigan. Then when I went off to college, I saw them much less often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-number-one-memory-how-to-take-risks-and-win&#34;&gt;My number one memory: how to take risks and win&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a child, sometimes I had the opportunity to play ping pong. I didn&amp;rsquo;t do it often, because we didn&amp;rsquo;t have the space, but every time we went up to East Lansing to visit Uncle and Aunt and my cousins, I looked forward to using their ping pong table. I got to play with my father, and then Uncle would step in and totally destroy both of us with his ultra-aggressive style. He was pretty serious about anything competitive (he played tennis also), and he had high-quality ping pong bats such that he could create a lot of spin, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main thing is that Uncle Steve moved fast and went for hard, fast killer shots whenever possible (while using the backhand spin defensively as appropriate). He didn&amp;rsquo;t always make it, but he went for it. I really admired his style of play. He used a &lt;a href=&#34;http://tabletennis.about.com/od/griptypes/a/jkpenholdgrip.htm&#34;&gt;Japanese-style penhold grip&lt;/a&gt; to maximize his forehand attacking style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used the Chinese-style penhold grip (learned from my father) for a long time whenever I played ping pong. The Japanese-style grip seemed too extreme for me. In any case, from Uncle Steve I learned to &lt;em&gt;stay on the attack&lt;/em&gt; in ping pong. Even though for much of my life I used to be shy and anxious, there were a couple of areas in my life in which I adopted a relentlessly aggressive persona. I have Uncle Steve to thank for showing me how it&amp;rsquo;s done. To this day, if I play ping pong, I will play in an attacking style, not a defensive style. I will err on the side of hitting the ball out of control and out of play losing points rather than playing &amp;ldquo;safe&amp;rdquo; and missing an opportunity to hit a winner. I don&amp;rsquo;t really know why, but I somehow absorbed this huge &lt;em&gt;life lesson&lt;/em&gt; from Uncle Steve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point, I did start switching around between the penhold grip and the shake-hand grip, because of comfort. I don&amp;rsquo;t play ping pong much these days; I think the last time was a year ago when I was back at my parents&amp;rsquo; home, where they have had a ping pong table for twenty years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a photo of my father and me playing ping pong twenty years ago:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-closing&#34;&gt;In closing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncle Steve leaves behind his wife, two children, and their children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Uncle Steve never got to see my new nephew Jack, born last month. But the cycle of life continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will miss Uncle Steve&amp;rsquo;s energy and fighting spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
