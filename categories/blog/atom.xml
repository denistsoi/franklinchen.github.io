      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just finished
&lt;a href=&#34;http://conscientiousprogrammer.com/blog/2015/05/31/why-i-switched-from-octopress-2-to-hugo/&#34;&gt;migrating both this blog and my programming blog from Octopress 2 to Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. During
this process, I made sure to preserve my old URLs as well as Disqus,
because nothing is as distressing to me, as a reader, as moved or
broken links when I&amp;rsquo;m looking for old blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, there&amp;rsquo;s always the possibility of changing the &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; URLs and
just using an alias with a URL redirect for the sake of old URL
schemes. One possibility was to remove dates from my URLs, e.g.,
change something like
&lt;code&gt;http://conscientiousprogrammer.com/blog/2015/05/31/why-i-switched-from-octopress-2-to-hugo/&lt;/code&gt;
to
&lt;code&gt;http://conscientiousprogrammer.com/blog/why-i-switched-from-octopress-2-to-hugo/&lt;/code&gt;. Matt
Gemmell, among many others, has argued for &lt;a href=&#34;http://mattgemmell.com/permalinks/&#34;&gt;permalinks that do not
include the clutter of embedded dates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I made the decision years ago, when I had the choice, to keep
the embedded dates, and I still stand by my decision today. Here&amp;rsquo;s why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;are-embedded-dates-actually-bad-user-interface-design&#34;&gt;Are embedded dates actually bad user-interface design?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure long date-embedded permalinks are really so bad
visually:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nobody goes around having to manually type in these links anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I believe that in the long run, people actually do care about the
date, and having it in the URL makes it that much easier to know the
date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redundancy can be a good thing, if it exposes useful information
that in theory one could determine more indirectly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-bigger-philosophical-issues&#34;&gt;The bigger philosophical issues&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the main reason I deliberately choose to expose the date of a
post is that I disagree with Matt Gemmell&amp;rsquo;s statement that one should
prefer to boost one&amp;rsquo;s article&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;standing&amp;rdquo; by giving the impression
that one is making a &amp;ldquo;definitive goddamned opinion&amp;rdquo; on a topic, some
kind of timeless statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;relevance&#34;&gt;Relevance?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that there are people who would be swayed by this
psychological trick, and I totally confess that sometimes when I do a
Web search and up pops a link to a four-year-old post, I wonder
whether to read something else instead that might be more &amp;ldquo;relevant&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as a reader who seeks genuinely useful information, no matter how
recent or old, I overcome my initial twinge at encountering an &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo;
article, and check it out for its own merits. And often, I find that
it is just fine. For example, there are some fantastic Haskell blogs
filled with information still useful today. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any of Dan Piponi&amp;rsquo;s articles are great, e.g., a random 2009 article
on
&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.sigfpe.com/2009/01/haskell-monoids-and-their-uses.html&#34;&gt;monoids and their uses&lt;/a&gt;,
with an ungainly URL of
&lt;code&gt;http://blog.sigfpe.com/2009/01/haskell-monoids-and-their-uses.html&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any of Gabriel Gonzalez&amp;rsquo;s articles are great, e.g., a 2012 article
on
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/06/you-could-have-invented-free-monads.html&#34;&gt;free monads&lt;/a&gt;
with the URL
&lt;code&gt;http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/06/you-could-have-invented-free-monads.html&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the dating is actually useful because once you see
another article by the same author with a different date, you know
which one came first and can retrace the &lt;em&gt;history&lt;/em&gt; of the author&amp;rsquo;s
thinking just throw the URL. In fact, I track my own history through
the fact that on my file system, my posts are in alphabetical order
according to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-reality-and-humanity-of-transience&#34;&gt;The reality and humanity of transience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the main fact I want to emphasize when I write is precisely
that I am not giving my definitive opinion about anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have no &amp;ldquo;forever&amp;rdquo; opinions about any topic!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I change my mind as I continue to grow and learn, and I want my
writing to reflect that, and in a way such that a reader can easily
track what changed and when. I do not write to give an illusion that I
am writing eternal truths. I do not write in order to be an authority
on a topic, but to share a snapshot of what I understand at a
particular moment in my life. When I change my mind, I do often go
back and add a dated update section linking to a new article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have retained dated permalinks for my migrated blogs, despite some
voices that argue otherwise, because of the extra information they
provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you agree that dated permalinks are worth the ugliness or not? Is
  this your opinion as an author, a reader, a critic, or a search
  engine user?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Starting a mini Digital Sabbath</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/11/12/starting-a-mini-digital-sabbath/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 12 Nov 2011 09:52:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/11/12/starting-a-mini-digital-sabbath/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing at least one blog post a day now for 42 days. I had started the blog bent on making it a real habit to maintain, and felt that forcing myself to write and upload every single day was necessary to keep the momentum going. I&amp;rsquo;m sure I was right, but now that I am confident in my self-discipline to maintain regularity, I am going to relax the arbitrary rule I set for myself, and start observing a mini Digital Sabbath in which I take a day off every week from blogging. I&amp;rsquo;m starting today (considering this little note as equivalent to taking a break).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you observe or considered observing your own Digital Sabbath in this busy, &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; world?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>One month anniversary of my blog</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/10/21/one-month-anniversary-of-my-blog/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 21 Oct 2011 22:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/10/21/one-month-anniversary-of-my-blog/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I created this blog one month ago, on &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/09/22/starting-a-new-web-site/&#34;&gt;September 22&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have achieved my short-term milestone of creating at least one post every day. This has not been a trivial task, and there have been times when I felt pressed for time or tired or was not excited about deciding what to write about and then doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I knew I had to develop the habit, and overcome perfectionism, and just get going. I&amp;rsquo;ve known too many people who started a blog, posted to it exuberantly for a while, and then didn&amp;rsquo;t continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some ways I have managed to go an entire month so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;advice-from-podcamp-pittsburgh-6&#34;&gt;Advice from PodCamp Pittsburgh 6&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began my new blog only after having attended &lt;a href=&#34;http://podcamppittsburgh.com/podcamp-pittsburgh-6/pcpgh6-sessions/&#34;&gt;PodCamp Pittsburgh 6&lt;/a&gt; and listening to enough advice that I had a strategy planned to get a strong start. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t start a new business without having an idea what I was doing, nor would I start a new computer program without having some tools and goals in mind, and writing for a blog is no different as a demanding enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;social-storytelling-by-shawn-graham-and-tom-kubilius&#34;&gt;Social storytelling, by Shawn Graham and Tom Kubilius&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to thank &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/shawngraham&#34;&gt;Shawn Graham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/tomkubilius&#34;&gt;Tom Kubilius&lt;/a&gt; for their session on &amp;ldquo;social storytelling&amp;rdquo;. To tell the truth, there is much they said (that I took notes on) that I have not yet implemented, but here is some of what I have consciously put into practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-do-i-care-about&#34;&gt;What do I care about?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shawn and Tom repeatedly emphasized knowing your &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; and what you care about. So when I write, I really do write about what I care about. There are a lot of things I could write about, but don&amp;rsquo;t, because I don&amp;rsquo;t really care about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This piece of advice has helped me stay focused on what I care about rather than what might be easy for me to write about but with less or no passion. For example, instead of writing about something I already know well, I&amp;rsquo;ll write about something I&amp;rsquo;m discovering and learning &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;. Since I do not really care much about the past, I do not bring it up unless it is a relevant prelude to a story from &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;be-committed-and-be-regular&#34;&gt;Be committed, and be regular&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where I got my idea of &lt;em&gt;committing&lt;/em&gt; to post &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; day. They didn&amp;rsquo;t tell anyone how often to be posting, but I decided on that schedule for myself, knowing that the more spaced out a new activity is, the less likely I can keep it going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;be-social&#34;&gt;Be social&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shawn put up a nice blog post shortly after PodCamp Pittsburgh 6 that discussed the &lt;a href=&#34;http://shawngraham.me/index.php/blog/the-golden-rule-of-successful-social-engagement&#34;&gt;golden rule of social engagement&lt;/a&gt;. My online activity cannot exist in a vacuum. For many years, I lurked and read a lot online but never commented. I&amp;rsquo;ve changed that &amp;ldquo;anti-social&amp;rdquo; behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, when I am reading a blog, and feel compelled to respond to a post, I strongly consider doing so if I feel I can maybe make a contribution. At times, I just submit a short comment at the article&amp;rsquo;s commenting system. Other times, I write my own article and post the URL of it as a comment. I find it useful to be inspired by some topic of discussion that other people already care out and started to talk about. Even if things do not progress beyond just my leaving a note, I know that I have planted a seed, and since the web is forever, the conversation can always be started back up by someone sometime later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(By the way, I am working on a blogroll of recommended sites I will put up on my web site.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;blogging-201-by-burghbaby-and-firemom&#34;&gt;Blogging 201, by @burghbaby and @FireMom&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At PodCamp Pittsburgh 6, I also attended &amp;ldquo;Blogging 201&amp;rdquo; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/burghbaby&#34;&gt;@burghbaby&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/FireMom&#34;&gt;@FireMom&lt;/a&gt;, another very informative session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/HwmsFdxsJmU?list=PL6F136EEC5F65EBDA&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;why-answers-a-lot&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why&amp;rdquo; answers a lot&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theme was repeated that a blogger should know the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; of what they&amp;rsquo;re doing, because all kinds of questions or dilemmas can be answered that way: frequency, tone, topics, appropriate language, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started writing only after knowing I had some pretty strong intuitions of why I&amp;rsquo;m doing it. Still, recently I have been thinking of tightening up those intuitions even further, and writing up a really specific &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; page to put up on my site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;finding-fodder&#34;&gt;Finding fodder&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The session had a ton of good advice on this topic.  I&amp;rsquo;ll just mention one of the useful points: keeping track of ideas to later write about. I keep a log of ideas that come to me (in fact, one just came to me when I was last in the shower), so that I have no shortage of topics to write about in case I either come up dry (as far as exciting experiences during a day) or find some connection with some other idea I want to write about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;blogging-boundaries-by-miss-britt&#34;&gt;Blogging boundaries, by Miss Britt&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PodCamp session by &lt;a href=&#34;http://miss-britt.com/&#34;&gt;Miss Britt&lt;/a&gt; was very energetic and insightful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-is-your-intent&#34;&gt;What is your intent?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britt noted that once upon a time, she used her blog to vent, and that led to a lot of trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to keep this in mind when I&amp;rsquo;m writing about something and I might be feeling annoyed. I think that my tone in a few of my posts so far has veered slightly into &amp;ldquo;venting&amp;rdquo; territory, but that is not where I intend to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;live-a-life-worth-writing-about&#34;&gt;Live a life worth writing about&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advice to have a life to write about somehow really stuck with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On days when I do something new and exciting, it is usually pretty easy to write something about it. So if I&amp;rsquo;ve run in a 5K race or tried a new recipe when cooking or learned something at a seminar, it&amp;rsquo;s fairly easy for me to write a post about my experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I even joked to a friend that I was engaged in &amp;ldquo;Blog-Driven Living&amp;rdquo;. Of course, it was just a joke: I have never done something arbitrary just to have something to write about, and never will. But interestingly, a different dynamic has developed: sometimes when there is a project I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to start, or complete, but have put off, I realize, &amp;ldquo;It would be nice if I actually got my act together and did it, so that I could write about it&amp;rdquo;, and do it! Blogging has actually improved my offline productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lunch&#34;&gt;Lunch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last day of PodCamp Pittsburgh 6, I was eating lunch and &lt;a href=&#34;http://justinkownacki.com/&#34;&gt;Justin Kownacki&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.robjdic.com/&#34;&gt;Rob de la Cretaz&lt;/a&gt; happened to sit near me. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t talking with them (to be honest, I was dead tired from the weekend and was just trying to eat my lunch alone and then take a long nap immediately afterwards), but overheard them discussing the past, present, and future of PodCamp Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I piped in, saying I had come the previous year, and learned some things but had not yet started the blog I wanted to start. They basically just said, do it, and don&amp;rsquo;t worry about whether it&amp;rsquo;s perfect right off the bat. Just get started, now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me several days to make the plunge, but I did do it. Thanks again, Justin and Rob!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;seth-godin&#34;&gt;Seth Godin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I must mention Seth Godin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/&#34;&gt;Seth Godin&lt;/a&gt; is my hero. He&amp;rsquo;s written a bunch of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/books.asp&#34;&gt;books&lt;/a&gt;, some of which I&amp;rsquo;ve actually read or browsed, before discovering his &lt;a href=&#34;http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, which I recommend subscribing to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very day after I started my blog, I saw his post on &lt;a href=&#34;http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/09/talkers-block.html&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;talker&amp;rsquo;s block&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and have had it in my web browser as a &amp;ldquo;permanent tab&amp;rdquo; since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Godin basically says, we don&amp;rsquo;t have talker&amp;rsquo;s block, so why should we have writer&amp;rsquo;s block? Reflecting on this, I knew that I was going to write as though I were talking. So here I am. The quality of my blog posts has varied. I know that. But that&amp;rsquo;s OK, because what matters is where I am and where I am going, not where I have been. I know I will improve considerably with time and experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One month of blogging, and I&amp;rsquo;m still at it, and still striving to improve at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, everyone, for your help!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
