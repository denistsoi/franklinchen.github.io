      <description>&lt;p&gt;I encountered an intriguing article &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.npr.org/2014/02/10/274687110/brazils-maria-rita-rediscovers-her-mother-through-music&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Brazil&amp;rsquo;s Maria Rita Rediscovers Her Mother Through Music&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;maria-rita&#34;&gt;Maria Rita&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The name &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Rita&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Maria Rita&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; was familiar to me for only one reason: exactly one year ago, by coincidence, right after &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/02/10/attending-j-jam-in-squirrel-hill-but-not-playing-music-in-it/&#34;&gt;attending a music performance&lt;/a&gt;, I was looking up performances of the bolero &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pbs.org/buenavista/music/songs/dos_gardenias.html&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dos Gardenias&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube, in order to see what was out there, and also to find a &amp;ldquo;karaoke&amp;rdquo; version I could use to practice singing to and playing the flute to (I ended up &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/03/17/finally-doing-some-latin-music-jamming-on-flute/&#34;&gt;playing the piece on flute a month later at a party&lt;/a&gt;), and one of the performances that struck me as notable and unusual was hers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that in this NPR program, when asked to choose a musical selection to end the program with, Maria Rita chose her recording of &amp;ldquo;Dos Gardenias&amp;rdquo;. You can watch a video of a live performance of hers &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DoBORm4iyE&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (sorry, the provider did not allow it to be embeddable). Do watch it: I found it strangely mesmerizing. It is understated compared to &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; bolero style, yet expressive in its own way. Also, this video has her moving to the music while singing, eyes closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it turns out that Maria Rita&amp;rsquo;s mother was the famous Brazilian singer &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elis_Regina&#34;&gt;Elis Regina&lt;/a&gt;, who died at 36. The interview was interesting because it brought up the issue of what it&amp;rsquo;s like being the child of a famous musician, because if you&amp;rsquo;re a musician also, then there are always comparisons and questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what I want to return to my real topic, which is the bolero &amp;ldquo;Dos Gardenias&amp;rdquo;, one of my favorite boleros ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;love-on-first-listen-ibrahim-ferrer-1999&#34;&gt;Love on first listen: Ibrahim Ferrer, 1999&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first encountered &amp;ldquo;Dos Gardenias&amp;rdquo; through Ibrahim Ferrer&amp;rsquo;s performance in &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buena_Vista_Social_Club_%28album%29&#34;&gt;Buena Vista Social Club&lt;/a&gt;, the film and the CD, which I came across in 2000, shortly after it came out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still love this live performance by Ibrahim Ferrer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/mz_01le5pMs&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here he is from the CD:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/5pKW7qvYSHU&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-i-love-this-song&#34;&gt;Why I love this song&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://lyricstranslate.com/en/dos-gardenias-two-gardenias.html&#34;&gt;lyrics&lt;/a&gt; are singable and comprehensible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The harmonic structure is distinctive, because it uses both the natural minor and the altered harmonic minor (raised 7th). This gives the song both an exotic and unstable feeling, corresponding to the emotional content of the lyrics. Check out when the 7th is raised and when it is not. In addition, the 4th is augmented. All this chromaticism drives well the song&amp;rsquo;s emotional content, implying various different modal regions coinciding with changes in the narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The melody has a good dramatic range, and has varying intervals in motion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;antonio-machin-1947&#34;&gt;Antonio Machin, 1947&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m always interested in alternate performances of songs, both new and old. So I went back to the source, the great &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Mach%C3%ADn&#34;&gt;Antonio Machin&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/OPq2ye7hJQg&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is faster than Ferrer&amp;rsquo;s rendition. If you examine the history of bolero performance in general, you will find that things have gotten slower and more sentimental over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find that there are pluses and minuses to different styles and speeds. I rather like the clarity and drama of the older faster tempo and style, but also like the room for more emotional expressiveness and freedom when slower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;omara-portuondo-2010&#34;&gt;Omara Portuondo, 2010&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that Abby and I went to a &lt;a href=&#34;http://trustarts.culturaldistrict.org/production/25334&#34;&gt;concert by Omara Portuondo here in Pittsburgh on November 7, 2010&lt;/a&gt;, in which she performed &amp;ldquo;Dos Gardenias&amp;rdquo;. And someone captured that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/9QjS2MnAfR0&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an interesting, very free rendition, without the usual full rhythmic backup, but instead featuring some subtle guitar accompaniment. It was different, but I did not like it so much. I think the regular structure of the song, the way the lyrics fit into the movement, makes it work better when the original motoric bolero rhythm is maintained, with the harmonic motion driving the narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;lucrecia-1996&#34;&gt;Lucrecia, 1996&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a random other performance I found. I didn&amp;rsquo;t like it at all. The phrasing seems all weird and distorted, and the song&amp;rsquo;s been reharmonized strangely also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/zgoEHFgwGes&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sertab-erener-2007&#34;&gt;Sertab Erener, 2007&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked the performance of this Turkish pop singer Sertab Erener. She includes some distinctive middle Eastern styling that are unusual for this Cuban music, but her musicality cannot be denied. (Unfortunately, the &amp;ldquo;dance&amp;rdquo; sequences in this video are not at all bolero. Ignore the video.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/d-0SKj7AjZg&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can I say, I&amp;rsquo;m obsessed with this beautiful bolero. However you like this song interpreted, it&amp;rsquo;s a must-listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t sung it outside my home yet, but I guess I should get around to it, maybe at a party in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;postscript-on-elis-regina&#34;&gt;Postscript on Elis Regina&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out Maria Rita&amp;rsquo;s mother, Elis Regina, singing the famous bossa nova song &amp;ldquo;Triste&amp;rdquo; in 1976:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/5wiJPgmEqR0&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</description>

      <title>Finally doing some Latin music jamming on flute; also Irish and French</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;St. Patrick&amp;rsquo;s Day weekend means, of course, a party at Henry&amp;rsquo;s. Last year Abby and I even went to two of his St. Patrick&amp;rsquo;s Day parties! At the first, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/03/17/st-patricks-day-party-playing-tin-whistle-and-flute/&#34;&gt;I played tin whistle for the first time&lt;/a&gt;, and I played some easy recorder music &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/03/30/a-delayed-st-patricks-day-party-playing-tin-whistle-and-alto-recorder/&#34;&gt;at the second&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, I reflected on how far I&amp;rsquo;ve come musically, and as usual, wanted to do something new and challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;irish-music&#34;&gt;Irish music&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I brought my tin whistle and Irish flute ready to jam. It turned out that Barbara had come with violin ready for some Irish jamming also. When she went at it with Henry on piano, she ended up playing &amp;ldquo;Danny Boy&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;Londonderry Air&amp;rdquo;) as one selection. Unfortunately, I had planned on playing it on flute, &amp;ldquo;redeeming&amp;rdquo; myself after being terrible on flute a year ago &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/03/17/st-patricks-day-party-playing-tin-whistle-and-flute/&#34;&gt;when I tried it&lt;/a&gt;, so since she had already done it, I quietly scrapped my original plan. No problem: there were many other things to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barbara joined me and Henry in some jigs, reels, and waltzes that I pulled out, some of which I did on tin whistle and some of which I did on Irish flute. That was fun, if pretty exhausting: lots and lots of notes, not so easy to just plain sight read. But of course, nobody has to play all the notes. That&amp;rsquo;s the beauty of this music. There never were official notes anyway; these are traditional tunes with a certain recognizable rhythm and shape and harmonic movement, but everyone does the notes differently anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;french-music&#34;&gt;French music&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d asked Vasili to learn on accordion &amp;ldquo;Les Ormeaux&amp;rdquo;, which I had learned just recently &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/02/25/stepping-it-up-at-the-french-and-blues-jam/&#34;&gt;at a French jam&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s not actually a traditional tune, but it&amp;rsquo;s a great one. Unfortunately, it turned out that Vasili had learned it in a different key from the one I was using on modern flute, so one of us (him) transposed on the fly to try to match, and the result therefore wasn&amp;rsquo;t as good as it could have been. Next time! Anyway, Abby and I jammed with Vasili on stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;latin-music&#34;&gt;Latin music&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;bolero&#34;&gt;Bolero&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The musical highlight for me was my debut in playing Latin, or more specifically, Cuban music. I fell in love with this music when I was &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/03/10/flute-loving-it-again/&#34;&gt;introduced to Latin ballroom dance back in 2000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started off with an unnamed bolero from a World Music Cuba book I had first encountered &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/02/22/flute-progress-still-hanging-in-there/&#34;&gt;a year ago when I was just barely playing flute&lt;/a&gt;. I got on flute and Henry enthusiastically improvised along on piano and we took a couple of turns. That was great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I pulled out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pbs.org/buenavista/music/songs/dos_gardenias.html&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dos Gardenias&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, one of my favorite boleros of all time (and the bolero is one of my favorite musical genres). (By the way, I am working on being ready to sing this and other boleros before too long, making my debut as a bolero singer.) Again, more fun opportunities for inventiveness for Henry and me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;buena-vista-social-club&#34;&gt;Buena Vista Social Club&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, I first encountered &amp;ldquo;Dos Gardenias&amp;rdquo; through Ibrahim Ferrer of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buena_Vista_Social_Club_%28album%29&#34;&gt;Buena Vista Social Club&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/5pKW7qvYSHU&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Buena Vista Social Club&amp;rdquo; was a very important music recording to me. At a time in my life around thirteen years ago when I was trying to explore Latin music and asked around for suggestions, my grad school classmate Andrej recommended this CD to me and my musical world was changed forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cha-cha&#34;&gt;Cha cha&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I pulled out an unnamed cha cha from the World Music Cuba book. We really went wild for this one, especially since Chad, one of Henry&amp;rsquo;s piano students (and a fine improviser) decided to join us and sat at the piano with Henry as both of them played with me and we kept going and going and I became very excited and inspired along with them. Wow. That was one of the most intense musical experiences I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had. It was frightening (didn&amp;rsquo;t know when I&amp;rsquo;d hit the limits of my technique or inventiveness) and exhilarating at the same time. When I was done, I was sweating from all the effort. Abby said she&amp;rsquo;d never seen me so animated before playing music, since she&amp;rsquo;s only ever seen me play Baroque and other such music mainly, or Irish and French. Well, Latin jazz is different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;chess&#34;&gt;Chess&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point in the evening, I needed a break from playing music and from socializing and decided to rest. However, it turned out that my &amp;ldquo;rest&amp;rdquo; consisted of relaxing in a chair while closing my eyes and&amp;hellip; &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/03/17/my-second-ever-blindfold-chess-game/&#34;&gt;playing blindfold chess&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-of-2014-03-16&#34;&gt;(Update of 2014-03-16)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t make it to Henry&amp;rsquo;s St. Patrick Day party in 2014. I felt sad about this, but our other plans made earlier made it impractical to try to attend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
