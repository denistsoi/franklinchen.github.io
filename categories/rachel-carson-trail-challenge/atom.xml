      <title>My Rachel Carson Trail hike for the year (13.4 miles): and how this is about love and gratitude</title>

      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/05/12/my-rachel-carson-trail-hike-for-the-year/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I did my first hike of the year (normally I would have done hiking already in the spring, but the combination of Abby&amp;rsquo;s broken foot and my Pittsburgh Marathon training this year resulted in no space for hiking until after the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/05/06/2013-pittsburgh-marathon-my-135th-race-was-my-worst-i-finished/&#34;&gt;marathon, which I did seven days ago&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first hike of the year just happened to turn out to be a grueling Rachel Carson Trail hike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, I reported on the two Rachel Carson Trail Challenge goal training hikes I did in &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/04/29/a-pretty-rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-hike/&#34;&gt;late April&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/06/03/a-totally-exhausting-rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-hike/&#34;&gt;early June&lt;/a&gt;. This year, I did the fourth of eight of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge/rctc13/goaltraining&#34;&gt;year&amp;rsquo;s goal training hikes&lt;/a&gt; offered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sunday, May 12&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leader: Donna Stolz 412-303-6102, Eileen Lessman 412-760-8863&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;13.4 miles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elevation change: 5055 ft&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This hike begins in North Park and heads over to Emmerling Park, then up and over Rich Hill and Lefever Hill. We end at the Log Cabin Road checkpoint location. Meet at Log Cabin Road parking area. Take Route 28 to Exit #12. Turn right at the end of the ramp, then right at the stop sign onto Little Deer Creek Road (aka Russellton Road). Travel about 1.5 miles and turn right on Log Cabin Road. Park about 100 yards ahead on the right.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of this year, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to do &lt;em&gt;only one&lt;/em&gt; Rachel Carson Trail hike a year, so this was it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my report on the hike, as well as my long-awaited explanation of why this trail means so much to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;weather&#34;&gt;Weather&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conditions were good. It was kind of chilly and windy, probably 45-50 degrees throughout the hike. The sun came and went. There were only short periods of light drizzling rain, thankfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;footwear&#34;&gt;Footwear&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek shoes I wore last year on the Rachel Carson Trail developed holes, as a result of which I &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/08/28/five-reasons-we-just-stocked-up-on-vibram-fivefingers-kso-trek-shoes/&#34;&gt;stocked up on some new ones&lt;/a&gt;. The pair that I opened, I&amp;rsquo;ve worn only a couple of times, and I wore this pair today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;comparison-with-last-year-s-hike&#34;&gt;Comparison with last year&amp;rsquo;s hike&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/06/03/a-totally-exhausting-rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-hike/&#34;&gt;Last year on the 18.1 mile hike&lt;/a&gt;, I was stupid about my smartphone, and this year I was smarter. Today&amp;rsquo;s hike was a shorter 13.4, so I was sure the battery would last long enough, if I didn&amp;rsquo;t take photos with flash. And of course, I always have a phone charge in my car now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year&amp;rsquo;s hike went east to west and ended in North Park. This year&amp;rsquo;s hike went west to east and started in North Park. But being shorter, it did not end in Springdale. It is really a different hike when you go on the same trail but in a different direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might enjoy comparing the photos in different directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;meeting-up-at-log-cabin-road&#34;&gt;Meeting up at Log Cabin Road&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John and I arrived on time but not early, which meant that when we arrived, we saw a whole contingent of people already carpooling to head to North Park. We never saw those people again. Oops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, although we were ready to go with the hike leader, Donna, latecomers kept on showing up, and we were lenient and waited for them, before all the rest of us remaining headed to North Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waiting for latecomers:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.03.20.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Because of Route 910 closures, some detours were necessary as Donna&amp;rsquo;s husband drove us to North Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hike&#34;&gt;Hike&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In North Park about to begin:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.45.23.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.45.26.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;By the time we started, there were only a handful of us together as a group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was momentarily confused because I saw someone running in the &lt;em&gt;wrong direction&lt;/em&gt; on the trail and thought she might be one of us, and was worried. I tried to follow her to call out to her, but she disappeared quickly:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.45.34.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Donna called out to me, and I rejoined the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In North Park, a few sections of the trail are on the road, but then we go into the woods for real:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.51.43.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.51.49.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.52.15.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a whole bunch of stream crossings while in North Park. Some of them are easier than others. I should note that one of the harder ones had some fast water and basically ensured that your feet would get wet, because the logs were floating and not completely safe to step on. Some people jumped, but that&amp;rsquo;s not safe. Wearing KSO Trek shoes, since the temperature was around 50, I was fine just getting my feet wet by walking through the water.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.05.16.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.05.22.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.10.50.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.10.56.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Out of the woods onto the railroad tracks (note that hiking in the reverse direction is tricky because it&amp;rsquo;s not well-marked where to get off the railroad tracks into the woods; John and I got lost the last time we did the reverse hike and had to backtrack!).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.18.50.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.19.23.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a good amount of road walking on this section of the Rachel Carson Trail.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.27.01.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.27.14.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.29.46.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.53.40.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Crossing Route 8:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.03.01.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally, the power lines:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.04.28.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.05.59.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.22.47.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I am a bit sentimental about this section of trail in Hampton Park because Abby and I have done some cross country skiing here in winter, when she used to live up here before we got married and she moved to Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.29.52.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Abby and I have also hung out here in the past watching birds.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.32.38.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.37.55.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.41.13.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.48.38.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.49.37.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.54.37.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here is where John and I got lost. I was distracted by this sight and made a turn toward it (the trail turned in the opposite direction) to check it out:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.55.25.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;OK, &amp;ldquo;acidic condensate collection tank&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.56.02.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Hmm, this didn&amp;rsquo;t look familiar.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.57.12.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_11.05.31.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;John and I turned back. We lost about ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_11.06.42.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_11.07.38.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_11.15.12.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_11.18.16.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;No animals out and about today!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_11.41.38.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_11.43.09.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Funny how this happens to me once or twice each hike:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.01.43.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What the heck is this going on?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.07.33.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Uphill.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.07.53.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.11.35.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.19.47.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally at Emmerling Park, about 3 hours and 45 minutes into the hike.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.28.15.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I hung out at Emmerling Park for about ten or fifteen minutes, using the restroom and then playing on the swing relieving my aching feet while waiting for John and the others to catch up and also use the restroom. The truth is, I was ready to stop hiking already, feeling tired. I was also sore because of two falls I had sustained earlier in the hike. One of the falls involved my tripping on my right foot, causing me to land hard on my left, reinjuring my left knee that I had hurt before the marathon in a fall down the stairs. My left knee was causing me serious pain again now in the hike. I also fell on a steep downhill earlier, landing directly on my butt and on the palm of my left hand, which reinjured my left elbow. Finally, my right Achilles was killing me, because I had not adjusted the strap of my shoe properly; I had readjusted it during the hike, but the damage was already done. I was quite ready to stop hiking, but there were still two hours to go! Oops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Red flower:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.49.45.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.49.54.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And now we got to sections of the trail that are abused by ATVs and rutted and muddy. (We ended up encountering someone on an ATV, in fact.)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_13.02.18.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Standing water:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_13.05.17.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No fun at all hiking through these muddy ruts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally back into open space:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back down the big hill:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s John and the rest down at the bottom:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally back to the parking lot!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_14.25.11.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;after&#34;&gt;After&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hiked something like 5 hours and 45 minutes. It felt really long to us, as our first hike of the year. My feet were killing me. I was happy to take my shoes off and drive us back home barefoot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, my phone still barely had battery power left when we finished. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure it would have lasted another hour. This is useful to know. Of course, I immediately plugged it into my car charger! I should get an extra battery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-hike-this-trail-at-all&#34;&gt;Why hike this trail at all?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby is confused why I like occasionally (once or twice a year) hiking on the Rachel Carson Trail, even though much of the time I find it tiring and weird. I&amp;rsquo;ve never fully explained this in words, so here, finally, is my explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have many sentimental reasons to hike this trail. One is that eight years ago, in late May of 2005, when a local running friend said he was doing the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge/rctc05&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Trail Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, I had taken an entire half year off from running was feeling sad and lonely. I looked up the Challenge online, and happened to find that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge/rctc05/training&#34;&gt;training hikes led by Barb Peterson&lt;/a&gt; were being offered in just a few days, and although I had no intention whatsoever to do the Challenge, I thought the training hikes would be a fun way to do and see something different. After doing the third of four, I was so excited by the novelty that I ended up signing up for the Challenge!! With only three weeks left, there was not much training I could do for it, but I figured that if I just took it slowly, I should be able to finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2005 Challenge was an ordeal for me to finish, but I did, and the side effect was that I fell in love with hiking in general. I met people through doing the Challenge, and in 2006 I roped John into joining me on some longer training hikes, where we met more people, and some of them I began hiking with outside the context of the Challenge, in places like the Laurel Highlands. This was before the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/pittsburghhikers/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Hiking Meetup&lt;/a&gt; was formed in May 2007 and made it much easier to find people to hike with. So the 2005 Challenge had the side effect of getting me into making hiking a regular part of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, as I was training for the 2007 Challenge, that was the time when I had just met Abby and was dancing with her, but we were not dating yet. When we were chatting at a salsa dance, I learned that she liked to hike and was intrigued. I invited her to join me and John for an April 29 Rachel Carson Trail Challenge training hike that happened to be passing through Hampton (as today&amp;rsquo;s hike did), and she said she would join us for part of it. A comic series of events then took place, in which John and I arrived at Hampton earlier than she had expected, so she had not yet made it to Hampton to meet up with us. When I paused to call her, and she said she would meet us in the trail, John and I got confused and lost because of miscommunication. I kept having to call her again and again until we finally found her, and she set us straight back onto the trail and hiked with us for a bit before turning back. That was my first interaction with Abby outside of dancing; I got to see how she gracefully handled my clumsy mistakes during this outing and how helpful she was. It was a month after that when we finally started dating. Eventually, I proposed right after a hike led by one of the guys I originally first met through a Rachel Carson Trail Challenge training hike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I associate the Rachel Carson Trail not only with falling in love with hiking, and with meeting lots of interesting people I still hike with all these years later, but also I am reminded of how I fell in love with Abby and how hiking is a big part of what we have done and do. It is slightly ironic, of course, that she does not enjoy doing most sections of the Rachel Carson Trail, so in recent years I have been hiking it either alone or with John. And that is why I try to limit how often I hike on the trail; I&amp;rsquo;ve decided now to do it only once a year, so that I spend less time on hiking that Abby doesn&amp;rsquo;t do with me, in order to share more hiking with her. But I would like to spend good time on the trail once a year from now on to remember what it means to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, despite the strange hybrid nature of the trail, I believe in its existence and maintenance. It is a reminder that even in urban/suburban environments, there is still an underlying primitive nature that we can enjoy. The volunteers of the Rachel Carson Trails Conservancy work hard to keep this unusual resource open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/03/11/fascinating-bushwhacking-hike-at-pa-state-game-land-51-dunbar/&#34;&gt;Example from March 2012 of the kind of hike that Abby and I have enjoyed doing.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rachel Carson Trail will always have a special place in my heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Donna for keeping us company for most of the hike as trail sweep, and her husband for driving us to the start!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>An unexpected afternoon tour: 9 miles of running, 1 Cathedral of Learning stair climb, 2 chess tournaments</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/02/02/an-unexpected-afternoon-tour-9-miles-of-running/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 02 Feb 2013 17:41:31 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/02/02/an-unexpected-afternoon-tour-9-miles-of-running/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had an amusing, completely impromptu Saturday afternoon tour in which I ran nine miles (including a couple of miles with a friend I&amp;rsquo;ve never actually seen running before or run with before), did one repetition of the Cathedral of Learning stair climb, and visited two different chess tournaments in Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of Friday evening, I had only planned to go for a run on Saturday. Here&amp;rsquo;s how I ended up on my unexpected tour instead.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/cathedral-of-learning-full.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Cathedral of Learning&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-did-not-run-in-the-morning&#34;&gt;I did not run in the morning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the week, since I had just &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/01/30/why-and-how-i-am-going-to-run-the-2013-pittsburgh-marathon/&#34;&gt;signed up for the 2013 Pittsburgh Marathon&lt;/a&gt;, I had considered to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.steelcityrrc.org/scrrcevents?eventId=582142&amp;amp;EventViewMode=2&amp;amp;CalendarViewType=1&amp;amp;SelectedDate=2/16/2013&#34;&gt;early Saturday morning training run&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.steelcityrrc.org/&#34;&gt;Steel City Road Runners&lt;/a&gt;, but by yesterday, had felt that I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to get up early on Saturday, and also it was going to be very cold, possible as low as 10 degrees F, and I felt more comfortable running near 20 degrees F as well as close to home so that I could bail out during my own long run and get back home and warm if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not run more than 5 miles continuously in a while. I anticipated running at least 7 miles out in the cold, depending on how I felt. I was certain that I would not run as long as 12 miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By afternoon, it was over 20 degrees F, so I felt fairly comfortable going out for an extended run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;chess-tournament-1-a-delayed-pittsburgh-chess-club-championship-round-3-game&#34;&gt;Chess tournament 1: a delayed Pittsburgh Chess Club Championship round 3 game&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, so I was exaggerating: I did not visit two complete chess tournaments on my tour. I did visit the final unplayed game of round 3 in the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/02/04/pittsburgh-chess-club-championship-2013-round-3-attack-defense-and-sacrifices/&#34;&gt;current Pittsburgh Chess Club Championship&lt;/a&gt; that is played Tuesday nights. The game was between Kurt Wallnau and Peter Jansen, and had been postponed because Kurt couldn&amp;rsquo;t make it on Tuesday. This game was important because likely the winner would be my opponent for round 4 on Tuesday, because of my current perfect score of three wins in the first three rounds so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that shortly before I was about to go for a run in the afternoon, I got word from Kurt that he was about to play his rescheduled game with Peter at the Pittsburgh Chess Club. So I thought I would run there from home (just a bit over a mile away) to stop by and take a look before continuing on with my run.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/wallnau-jansen.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Wallnau-Jansen from round 3&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When I arrived, the game had barely begun, so I just immediately went back out to continue running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;chess-tournament-2-2013-pa-state-game-75-championship-http-www-pitt-edu-schach-chesspa-wpastate-htm&#34;&gt;Chess tournament 2: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitt.edu/~schach/ChessPA/wpastate.htm&#34;&gt;2013 PA State Game/75 Championship&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally I had planned to maybe run in Homewood Cemetery for a bit, but I suddenly changed my mind after running for a while and decided to check out the tournament in progress at the William Pitt Union, the 2013 PA State Game/75 Championship. So I ran into Oakland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as I approached, staring me in the face was the Cathedral of Learning.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/cathedral-of-learning-on-run.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Cathedral of Learning&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;cathedral-of-learning-stair-climb&#34;&gt;Cathedral of Learning stair climb&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly I decided that I would do something I had never done before, which was to do the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/01/31/doing-an-unexpected-workout/&#34;&gt;Cathedral of Learning stair climb&lt;/a&gt; right after having run a couple of miles. An interesting circuit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I did one repetition of the 36 floors. I experimented with just continuing to run up the stairs, but quickly found that this was completely unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As another experiment, I did not just sit down and rest after finishing the stair climb. I stayed on my feet and immediately got on the elevator back down and out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went across the street to the chess tournament in progress. The games in the round were mostly done, so there wasn&amp;rsquo;t that much to see:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/2013-pa-state-game-75.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;2013 PA State Game/75 Championship&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;run-with-jason&#34;&gt;Run with Jason&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I ran back to the Pittsburgh Chess Club in Squirrel Hill to see what was going on there. Kurt and Peter had reached a very strange and unclear position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was planning to go back out to run some more before coming back to the club again when I spotted Jason, a chess club regular whom I have known since winter 2005 when he was one of the first people I met, in addition to &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/12/18/round-6-of-pittsburgh-chess-club-tournament-playing-pragmatically/&#34;&gt;Jeff&lt;/a&gt;, during my first visits to the Pittsburgh Chess Club. (He also happens to have started playing in chess tournaments again for the first time in several years!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joked to him, &amp;ldquo;How come you weren&amp;rsquo;t out running with me?&amp;rdquo; and he said that actually, he was about to go out running again, having run &amp;ldquo;a couple of hours&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/01/27/how-to-gut-out-the-tough-workout/&#34;&gt;in Frick Park&lt;/a&gt; in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still amazed that Jason so quickly became an &lt;a href=&#34;http://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Jason&amp;amp;lname=Maruccio&amp;amp;age=36&#34;&gt;ultrarunner&lt;/a&gt;. A couple of years ago we&amp;rsquo;d gone on some hikes together, and he said he was not a runner. After I hiked the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Trail Challenge&lt;/a&gt; three years in a row, he got excited about signing up for the first time. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge/rctc08/volunteers&#34;&gt;Abby and I volunteered&lt;/a&gt; at an aid station for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge/rctc08&#34;&gt;2008 Rachel Carson Trail Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, and greeted Jason as he came through our aid station. Little did I know that he would continue doing not only the Rachel Carson Trail Challenge again and again, but other endurance hikes as well. Eventually, he decided to start running, and he never looked back, and became a full-blown ultrarunner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Jason went out for a run on the roads in Schenley Park for a couple of miles. It was out first ever run together, actually, and the first time I had ever seen him running. (We haven&amp;rsquo;t hiked together in years.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We came back to the chess club, and I saw that the Wallnau-Jansen game was still in a very strange, complex state, and I decided it was time to go home for the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;back-home&#34;&gt;Back home&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my way back home, I started feeling really cold and hungry and tired and sore (despite having eaten a banana and some nuts an hour earlier that I had brought with me). The temperature was still around 25F, not terribly cold, but clearly I had taxed my body with my adventures. My toes were blistering and cramping up because of my footwear (I still have to really solve the problem of what shoes to wear for winter running).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was grateful to get home, eat and stretch, shower, and warm back up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did some calculations and I ran a total of about 9 miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s fun to just go and have unplanned adventures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why and how I am going to run the 2013 Pittsburgh Marathon</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/01/30/why-and-how-i-am-going-to-run-the-2013-pittsburgh-marathon/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Jan 2013 20:31:41 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/01/30/why-and-how-i-am-going-to-run-the-2013-pittsburgh-marathon/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I surprised myself by deciding suddenly to run the &lt;a href=&#34;http://pittsburghmarathon.com/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Marathon&lt;/a&gt; this year, 2013. This was not part of the plan when I was &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/12/31/why-i-went-frick-park-trail-running-in-snowfall-for-the-first-time-in-a-decade/&#34;&gt;thinking about my running plans for 2013 a month ago&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be my second Pittsburgh Marathon, because the last time I ran it was in 2003, and that was my first marathon ever. It was quite an ordeal to finish, because of a lot of rookie mistakes, but I made it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I am in 2003 near the finish line (photo courtesy of my sister Linda):&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/pittsburgh-marathon-2003/P5040055.JPG&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And here I am wearing my medal for finishing in 2003:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/pittsburgh-marathon-2003/P5040061.JPG&#34; /&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin inside with medal&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So: why am I running the Pittsburgh Marathon again, &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, ten years later? What do I hope to accomplish? And how?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why&#34;&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;do-it-better&#34;&gt;Do it better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2003, I ran my first marathon for a variety of reasons, and trained in certain ways, had certain expectations. I will write in depth later about that first marathon, because one reason I am running the Pittsburgh Marathon again now is to &lt;em&gt;do everything better&lt;/em&gt; this time, with the benefit of experience and new self-knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maintain a smart pace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finish strong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid leg muscle cramping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid foot blistering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conquer the hills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sharp contrast to my first marathon, I do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; plan to race this marathon as fast as I can. That blew up on me, and I do not have the time or desire to maximize my marathon performance at this point in my life. I do want to run strong, but not maximally. So I am not almost certainly not going to run faster than I did ten years ago; I am specifically expecting to run &lt;em&gt;slower&lt;/em&gt; but to have a &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; overall experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will not be the second time I run a marathon distance; I have done that two or three times on my own while training for the &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/rachel-carson-trail-challenge/&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Trail Challenge&lt;/a&gt; and have also run just over a marathon distance in the annual Sammy&amp;rsquo;s Birthday Run (a 6-hour ultra event) in 2006 and 2008. But those I did pretty slowly just for training and fun, in well over four hours. In the 2013 Pittsburgh Marathon, I&amp;rsquo;d like to finish close to the completely arbitrary magic number of 4:00:00. This is very low priority compared to the other goals, but it&amp;rsquo;s useful to have a little bit of ambition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;experiment&#34;&gt;Experiment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides what I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; now that I didn&amp;rsquo;t, there are also things that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know then and still don&amp;rsquo;t know now, but have hypotheses about. So the experience will be an opportunity to test my hypotheses. In particular, the kind of exercise and diet I follow now different in various ways from ten years ago. I do a lot more core and strength training and less endurance training. So my main goal, in fact, is to run this marathon with relatively &lt;em&gt;low mileage&lt;/em&gt;. Instead of spending huge amounts of time and energy banging out the miles in training, I want to try ways of getting in really high-quality training that will enable me to handle the marathon distance better and gut it out through strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;social&#34;&gt;Social&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first Pittsburgh Marathon experience had me running all alone. I did have support as far as my sister coming to town and my friend Nathaniel watching me and cheering me on at certain points along the course, but out there, I was alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, I decided not to do the marathon unless I had at least a friend or two joining me. I got my office mate John to sign up (he also did the marathon over a decade ago). &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.runoverit.com/&#34;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt; is signed up for it, although he actually has yet to run his first marathon, which will be coming up in March. There are a bunch of others I also know who will be running. I guess when time comes, we&amp;rsquo;ll figure out how our likely paces might coincide (or not).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;it-will-be-on-my-birthday&#34;&gt;It will be on my birthday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can I say: it will be my very first race of any distance run &lt;em&gt;on my birthday&lt;/em&gt;. I thought it would be amusing and cool to celebrate my birthday by running the Pittsburgh Marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;discount&#34;&gt;Discount&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As staff at CMU, I (and my office mate John) get a &lt;a href=&#34;http://athletics.cmu.edu/fitness/fitkit2013&#34;&gt;special discount for the Pittsburgh Marathon&lt;/a&gt;. This explains why I registered today, right before the deadline!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the reduced registration fee, part of the deal is &amp;ldquo;Special access to private finish line tent with gourmet food, private massages, and more!&amp;rdquo; as well as 6 months free membership to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.steelcityrrc.org/&#34;&gt;Steel City Road Runners&lt;/a&gt;. Not bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;update-of-2013-03-16&#34;&gt;(Update of 2013-03-16)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should note that the Steel City Road Runners was formed in 2011. John and I had in fact attended its &amp;ldquo;kick-off party&amp;rdquo; on Tuesday, September 13, 2011 where we did a free training run, but we ended up not joining the club or participating further, since we were not planning to do the Pittsburgh Marathon in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how&#34;&gt;How?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;rsquo;t actually much time before the marathon (three months), so I have to be smart about training and try to avoid setbacks. Some things I need to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;immediately start extending the distance of my runs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continue core and strength training&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep up stair climbing and hill running&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build up to some rigorous interval training&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;schedule long races to run in before the marathon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cut back on various commitments in the next three months&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;removing-chess&#34;&gt;Removing chess&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve already decided on one major activity I am going to cut out: after I finish the current Tuesday night chess tournament, the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/02/04/pittsburgh-chess-club-championship-2013-round-3-attack-defense-and-sacrifices/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Chess Club Championship&lt;/a&gt;, I will take a break and not play in any more Tuesday night chess tournaments until possibly the fall (in summer I&amp;rsquo;d rather be playing outside in the sun rather than hunched over a chess board indoors!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time and energy are limited. We can&amp;rsquo;t do everything all the time. In fact, as things are, I have not even been able to play in the monthly &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitt.edu/~schach/ChessPA/ChessLeague/wpapcl.htm&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Chess League&lt;/a&gt; team matches since &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/11/11/pittsburgh-chess-league-round-3-back-to-chess-after-a-month-off/&#34;&gt;November&lt;/a&gt;: in December I was occupied with &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/12/02/oblivion-obsession-time-to-start-playing-melodica/&#34;&gt;music rehearsal&lt;/a&gt;, and just now in January I was coming off a hard week during which I was &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/01/25/notes-on-exercising-while-sick-or-tired/&#34;&gt;sick and overbooked&lt;/a&gt;. I do hope to make it to the February team match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m doing well in the Pittsburgh Chess Club Championship so far, with a perfect score in my first three rounds, so I hope I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to say goodbye while winning it after another three rounds!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;footwear&#34;&gt;Footwear&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost certainly I will wear my &lt;em&gt;worn-out and holey&lt;/em&gt; pair of &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/08/28/five-reasons-we-just-stocked-up-on-vibram-fivefingers-kso-trek-shoes/&#34;&gt;Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek shoes&lt;/a&gt;. The reason is that I have &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; been blistered wearing these shoes, no matter the distance. The leather is really comfortable for me. And I will wear the worn-out pair rather than a newer pair because on the roads, I don&amp;rsquo;t want the deeply lugged outsoles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other alternative I thought about was wearing huaraches such as my &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/09/30/running-my-10th-great-race-10k-obscene-but-in-a-good-way/&#34;&gt;Xero Shoes that I wore in the Great Race 10K&lt;/a&gt;. I will do some experiments in the spring running much longer distances than 10K in huaraches, but I am currently very skeptical about running an entire marathon in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m excited to be back for marathon running. I hope to have a stimulating adventure in the next three months as I train for and participate in the 2013 Pittsburgh Marathon!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Cathedral of Learning&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Tonight I climbed the steps of the 36 accessible floors of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_of_Learning&#34;&gt;University of Pittsburgh Cathedral of Learning&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in probably a couple of years. As I mentioned after my last big stair climb, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/10/06/the-fineview-stepathon-2012-pittsburghs-grueling-urban-trail-race/&#34;&gt;this year&amp;rsquo;s Fineview Stepathon&lt;/a&gt;, I used to do some training here, when preparing for the tortuous annual 35-mile &lt;a href=&#34;http://rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Trail Challenge&lt;/a&gt; held in June, which I did in 2005, 2006, and 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I thought a lot about how my physical fitness took a sharp turn downward in the past five years, and how for the coming new year of 2013 I plan to get back into the shape I was in five years ago, and why that is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to frame my discussion in terms that are used in &lt;a href=&#34;http://charlesduhigg.com/&#34;&gt;Charles Duhigg&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s fantastic book I just read, &lt;a href=&#34;http://charlesduhigg.com/the-power-of-habit/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Power of Habit&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; (which everyone should read).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;walking-to-the-cathedral-of-learning&#34;&gt;Walking to the Cathedral of Learning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a short walk from my office at CMU to the Cathedral of Learning. There was a bit of snow and ice on the roads and sidewalks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought about how until the snow fell this week, it was still possible to go &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/12/i-love-trail-running-in-frick-park/&#34;&gt;running in the trails of Frick Park&lt;/a&gt;, one of my favorite things to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except that I basically &lt;em&gt;haven&amp;rsquo;t been running&lt;/em&gt; for two months now. I got &amp;ldquo;busy&amp;rdquo;, it got &amp;ldquo;cold&amp;rdquo;, and I more or less stopped exercising at all. One thing I learned when &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/09/23/happiness-is-finishing-39th-of-43-men-in-a-race/&#34;&gt;over a decade ago I started running&lt;/a&gt; and really did acquire a regular daily exercise schedule, is that the benefits of exercise are tremendous, and carry over into all aspects of life, from building endurance to attaining mental balance and sharpness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, my exercise schedule has more or less fallen apart in the last five years, with some seasonal variation in that in the summer, it&amp;rsquo;s much easier to just go outside and run or hike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;beginning-the-climb&#34;&gt;Beginning the climb&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the ground floor of the Cathedral of Learning, with stairway entrance in sight:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/cathedral-of-learning-steps/floor-g.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Floor G&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;habits-and-social-support&#34;&gt;Habits and social support&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A regular exercise &lt;em&gt;habit&lt;/em&gt; starts somewhere. Some kind of decision, some kind of cue. It&amp;rsquo;s important to get started, and conquer anxiety and excuses. Given that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t done this stair climb in years, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know how I would fare going up. I saw no reason to believe that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t make it all the way up just once, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to run out of steam. I wanted to be steady and strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important not to try to do too much all at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;em&gt;social support&lt;/em&gt; is really quite important. It turns out that in the past, I had friends who were totally into serious running and hiking and the like. One by one they moved away, and furthermore after I met Abby, my entire life routine changed. To be clear, I&amp;rsquo;m not &amp;ldquo;blaming&amp;rdquo; her presence in my life for my broken exercise routine; I take full responsibility for not adapting fully to circumstances. Nobody said the transition from bachelorhood to marriage was easy. It turns out that Abby is not at all interested in extreme endurance events such as marathons or the Rachel Carson Trail Challenge, and helped dissuade me from participating further in such events; but I made the decision with her, of my own free will, feeling that the time and energy spent toward such pursuits would be better spent on other activities instead, now that she was in my life. Every couple has to negotiate these kinds of life changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, what happened to me was that I didn&amp;rsquo;t fully realize how interconnected all of my exercise-related activities were, such that removing an admittedly unnecessary and extreme part of it had an indirect effect on my motivation and routine for less extreme activities. The goal of participating in the events had somehow become a major motivator in doing things that didn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily have to require participating in those events. Basically, I had inadvertently created for myself a &lt;em&gt;reward&lt;/em&gt; that I depended on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, my &lt;em&gt;cue&lt;/em&gt; was broken. My cue used to be to wake up, hop out of bed, and prepare to run or lift weights or something. But I have not been doing that since Abby came into the picture, for various reasons, some of which are no longer even relevant, but the cue was destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This indirect effect, combined with the addition of a lot more into my life that had formerly not existed (not just time spent with Abby, but also more recent new activities involving taking up &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/11/17/a-childhood-dream-come-true-i-am-now-finally-singing-for-real/&#34;&gt;playing music&lt;/a&gt; and getting into &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/09/06/my-pittsburgh-ruby-talk-nil/&#34;&gt;personal computer programming projects and social meetups&lt;/a&gt;), served to completely disrupt all of my usual routines, not just the exercise one. Even if I had time and energy to exercise, often I&amp;rsquo;d find some other thing I &amp;ldquo;had&amp;rdquo; to do instead, like practice music or going to a computer programming meetup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;going-up&#34;&gt;Going up&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/cathedral-of-learning-steps/warning.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Warning sign&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The famous warning sign about the stairwell not being meant for &amp;ldquo;exercise or other athletic activity&amp;rdquo; certainly did not deter people like Danny Chew, who did &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dannychew.com/101timesupCoL.html&#34;&gt;101 repetitions in over 17 hours&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve never done more than a single repetition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/cathedral-of-learning-steps/stairway.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Stairway&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-rhythm-established&#34;&gt;A rhythm established&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make something a habit, it must be regular and sustainable, in order to build confidence and strength. So I established a simple rhythm going up the steps just one at a time (not two at a time as I used to when I was more fit). One step at a time is much, much easier than two steps at a time. I only did two for the challenge of going fast. Speed is of no concern to me right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a clip of my going between floors 17 and 21. Some guy wearing a CamelBak actually passed me while he was going down; you can hear him but can&amp;rsquo;t see him in the video:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34;
src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/CDJDZcixA2A&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to exercise every morning before eating breakfast. But for the first couple of years with Abby, that routine was broken, because she had no such routine. A lot of the radical changes in one&amp;rsquo;s life when no longer being alone are, I think, a result of individual differences. If X used to do something, but Y did not, then by default it is easy to slip into a joint routine in which neither do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, relatively recently, Abby did take up semi-regular exercise before breakfast, going out for a walk, in an attempt to encourage me to do likewise with her. But I&amp;rsquo;m not interested in going for a leisurely walk before breakfast. I want to do something strenuous and then get going with my day. Meanwhile, I had fallen into a pattern of sleeping later and later, which was the real problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two days ago, I resolved on a major life change. I&amp;rsquo;m going to become a genuine morning person. I woke up spontaneously before 5 AM yesterday, and also today. I have not been ready to launch into a super-early morning exercise program yet, and it is a good idea to change &lt;em&gt;one habit at a time&lt;/em&gt; rather than multiple, so I am focusing right now simply on sleeping earlier and waking earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;just-a-few-more-floors-left&#34;&gt;Just a few more floors left&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pleased that at the rhythm and pace I had chosen, I was going up pretty well, without running out of breath or having to use the handrails for support. I suspect that a couple of things I&amp;rsquo;ve done in the past couple of years have helped a lot. I know I&amp;rsquo;ve improved my &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/17/the-joys-of-convict-conditioning-bodyweight-exercising/&#34;&gt;core strength&lt;/a&gt; through doing bodyweight exercises such as pushups, pullups, squats, and lunges. As a result, despite my overall being less fit than years ago, I have better balance and stability, enabling me to activate my glutes rather than lean on my quads when climbing stairs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/cathedral-of-learning-steps/floor-31.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Floor 31&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Right after the 31st floor, I was amused to see some posters people had put up for the annual &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lung.org/pledge-events/pa/pittsburgh-climb-fy13/&#34;&gt;Fight for Air Climb&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve never done this event, actually. I have to confess that an indoor stair climb is not the most exciting thing in the world for me, and I do the Cathedral of Learning climb mainly when the weather outside is not as good as I like.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/cathedral-of-learning-steps/fight-for-air-climb.jpg&#34; /&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Posters for Fight for Air Climb&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-top&#34;&gt;The top&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 36th floor is the last one accessible. There are a couple more going up, but the door after the 36th floor is locked.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/cathedral-of-learning-steps/floor-36.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Floor 36&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some night views out the windows on the 36th floor:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/cathedral-of-learning-steps/night-view.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Night view&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/cathedral-of-learning-steps/night-view-2.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Another night view&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I arrived at the 36th floor without any distress. It felt &amp;ldquo;easy&amp;rdquo;, even, but then again, I was going slowly and one step at a time. Nevertheless, this gives me confidence. I will continue to do the stair climb this winter. Also, perhaps next time I will do two repetitions, which I&amp;rsquo;ve never done before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed getting back to exercising and doing the Cathedral of Learning stair climb. I used the time to also reflect on my shortcomings in recent years in sticking to an exercise plan, and to commit to my vision of becoming more fit in 2013 than I was in 2007, one step at a time. And finally, I am taking full responsibility for my slacking: the fact that it happened as a result of taking a new direction in life with Abby is not at all her fault, especially given that she has been trying to get me to start exercising regularly again!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A totally exhausting Rachel Carson Trail Challenge goal training hike (18.1 miles</title>

      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/06/03/a-totally-exhausting-rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-hike/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In April, I reported on a nice &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/04/29/a-pretty-rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-hike/&#34;&gt;8.9 mile hike on the Rachel Carson Trail&lt;/a&gt; I did with John, the second of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge/rctc12/goaltraining&#34;&gt;eight goal training hikes for the Rachel Carson Trail Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. I looked forward to doing a really long hike on the Rachel Carson Trail with John as my last hike on this trail for the year, and today was the one opportunity I had (during a very busy spring and summer weekend schedule) to get it in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The description of today&amp;rsquo;s hike, the seventh of eight:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sunday, June 3, 2012&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leader: Craig Fowler 412-491-6643&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;18.1 miles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elevation change: 6915 ft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;On this hike we&amp;rsquo;ll cover the second half of this year&amp;rsquo;s Challenge course. Starting in Springdale near the Springdale Veterans Association Hall, we&amp;rsquo;ll hike through Springdale then hit Log Cabin hill, Lefever Hill, and Rich Hill. Then we&amp;rsquo;ll stick the landing in North Park. Meet at the Harmar Shelter in North Park. Directions: Take I279 north to the McKnight Road exit and travel 6.4 miles north. Take the North Park/Ingomar Rd. exit east and turn right at the third traffic light onto Babcock Blvd., then take the next left onto Hemlock Drive, then left again into the swimming pool lot. Follow the perimeter drive all the way back and bear right. The Harmar Shelter is ahead on the left, behind the guardrail.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that a lot of things went wrong during this hike, but we survived!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;volunteering&#34;&gt;Volunteering&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the season, there had been a call for volunteers to lead or assist in the goal training hikes. I felt like giving back to the Rachel Carson Trail community, but didn&amp;rsquo;t feel ready yet to actually lead a hike. Instead, I accepted the role of helping (with John) by assisting in one of the longer ones, serving as trail sweeps in the back, aiding Miranda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;footwear&#34;&gt;Footwear&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to do a very long hike as a test of whether my feet could hold up in Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek shoes, on tough terrain as well as a very long distance. I always had problems (toe jamming, blistering, knee and ankle pain) wearing trail running shoes in the past hiking the Rachel Carson Trail in previous years when going about 20 miles or longer. In April&amp;rsquo;s Rachel Carson Trail hike, my feet got sore but otherwise I felt great. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how things would scale up to a much longer distance. So this was an opportunity to test my limits in FiveFingers shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;camera&#34;&gt;Camera&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/03/22/paradox-i-will-observe-the-national-day-of-unplugging-but-just-bought-my-first-smartphone-this-week/&#34;&gt;I have a smartphone, finally&lt;/a&gt;, I no longer have to lug around the bulky digital camera that I&amp;rsquo;ve had to use for the past couple of years for taking photos. So I decided to bring just the phone for this hike. On the April hike, my new phone&amp;rsquo;s camera had been dead for days (I ended up getting a replacement phone, whew!), so I had used John&amp;rsquo;s camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;meeting-up-at-north-park&#34;&gt;Meeting up at North Park&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John and I had a weird carpooling arrangement to get to North Park. Only John and I were hiking, but Abby needed to be up in the vicinity to visit her parents and pick up her car that they had, so we all went together. Abby dropped us off, the idea being that her parents were going to stop by North Park later in the morning to give her car back so that she could drive back home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parked at Harmar Shelter:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_08.11.20.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;hike&#34;&gt;Hike&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took quite a while to ride back in a carpool to Springdale for the start. That just made us think of how long it would take to hike back to North Park!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I am, ready to start hiking:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_08.52.05.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Denser and higher greenery in June than a month ago:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_09.00.53.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Years ago, when I did the Rachel Carson Trail Challenge, the trail in Springdale went through a section of land called the &amp;ldquo;roller coaster&amp;rdquo;. Sadly, in recent years, because of problems landowners had with misbehaving hikers, they revoked the permission they had given for so long to go through their land. This force some rerouting of the trail through the streets of Springdale. Ironically, the rerouting resulted in the trail finally actually passing by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://rachel_carson_homestead.myupsite.com/&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Homestead&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_09.15.03.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some dirt road hiking:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_09.22.15.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A critter!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_09.26.37.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Butterfly:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_09.32.10.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Inevitable road walking, part of the whole Rachel Carson Trail experience:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_10.14.12.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Up:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_10.20.34.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Nice view into the distance:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_10.23.54.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_10.27.49.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_10.32.43.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now descending toward the road:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_10.35.29.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Looking back toward John:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_10.37.49.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the woods:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_10.45.23.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the &amp;ldquo;Rachel Carson Trail&amp;rdquo; signs, yellow on brown:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_10.52.30.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Back to road:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_11.08.39.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Dirt road:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_11.17.59.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Big descent coming up; you can see how there will be a valley:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_11.19.29.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_11.23.27.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The thing to remember is that after getting to the bottom, the trail does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; go back up. It actually makes a left.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_11.23.33.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_11.26.37.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the woods again:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_11.43.49.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_11.58.15.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Stream crossing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_12.30.28.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_12.31.41.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very convenient that the trail passes through Emmerling Park, because you can get water from the fountain and use the restrooms here before going on.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_12.39.41.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_12.48.05.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;An unpleasant section of high-speed road with no sidewalk:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_13.15.13.jpg&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_13.28.44.jpg&#34; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Animals!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_14.16.44.jpg&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Looking like it might rain:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_15.14.01.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_15.18.08.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;oops&#34;&gt;Oops&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, at this point, six and a half hours into a very long hike, my phone&amp;rsquo;s battery ran out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a problem because John and I had gotten separated from anyone else for some time already, and I worried about not being able to communicate with the hike leaders, whose responsibility it was to make sure everyone was accounted for at the end of the hike. Craig had my phone number, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t call him and he couldn&amp;rsquo;t call me. Nor could I call Abby to let her know when John and I were done and heading home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;finishing-the-hike&#34;&gt;Finishing the hike&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made it to North Park, but then &lt;em&gt;got lost&lt;/em&gt; in the trails. I had route maps on my phone, but my phone was dead. &lt;em&gt;Luckily&lt;/em&gt;, I had brought some paper printouts of some road maps of North Park (but no trail maps!!). As long as we got out of the woods and onto the roads, I was sure we would find the shelter and my car and be OK. At worst, there would be people around in North Park we could ask for more detailed directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it began to rain. Really hard. My paper maps were getting blurry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We eventually got to a road, and asked random people where the Harmar Shelter was, but they didn&amp;rsquo;t know. After some wandering around, we finally figured out where we were on the printed maps I had (the rain had stopped), and backtracked toward the shelter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then all of a sudden, John pointed at a car and said, &amp;ldquo;That car looks a lot like yours!&amp;rdquo; I replied that a lot of cars looked like mine, and ignored him. But then he noticed some distinguishing features and said it looked like it actually was mine. We were lucky, because it turned out the car was mine!! (Later I would learn from Abby that she had moved the car from where it had been parked in front of the shelter, to some random place further away, and texted me about the move, but of course, since I had not been checking my phone during the hike, and it died, I had no idea.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we made a note of where the car was before heading to the shelter. We saw no trace of Craig or Miranda. Oh great. Since Abby had moved the car, Craig must have left without waiting for us to return because he saw our car gone and assumed we had returned faster and had already gone home! (Later it would turn out that he had texted me as well as left voice mail asking me where I was and then after not getting a reply said he was leaving because he assumed we had finished.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shelter had a big, noisy party going on. We asked some random drunk guy if we could borrow his cell phone to make a call. He was kind enough to lend us the phone, and I called Craig (I was so fortunate that I had written in pen Craig&amp;rsquo;s number on one of the pieces of paper I had on me during the hike), and cleared up the confusion over whether we had finished or gone home. Then I called Abby and let her know John and I were OK, and drove us home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;after&#34;&gt;After&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was very happy to have made it home, and ate a ton of food. I noticed that my toes were numb, from all the hiking and the cold of stream crossing and rain. Also, my ankles were very stiff. The soles of my feet were quite sore. But I had no other leg soreness. So the experiment with footwear partially succeeded. (The numb toes were OK again after a couple of hours.) But still, I cannot imagine hiking more than 20 miles comfortably with the Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek. My feet were simply very sore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-learned&#34;&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned many lessons during this exhausting hike:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trail sweep can be a lonely, arduous task. I&amp;rsquo;m used to hiking with a pack of people, or at least having a pack in sight. Not being the fastest hikers on this hike, being the sweep meant actually being left behind!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am immediately buying a phone charger for my car. It would have saved a lot of trouble if I had been able to charge my phone upon reaching it, in order to access missed text messages and voice mail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; going to completely rely on the phone again for directions or maps. I will always have backup paper printouts of all important information, and in fact, put them in plastic bags in case of rain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will turn off automatic flash in order to save the phone battery when taking photos. Also, turn off unnecessary apps, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The FiveFingers shoes didn&amp;rsquo;t work too badly, but for a truly long distance are not cushioned enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the final hours, John and I simply were no longer enjoying the hike, but just wanted to finish. We don&amp;rsquo;t really want to do a hike this long or grueling again. We did about 20 miles today (extra distance beyond 18.1 because of getting lost in various places). &lt;em&gt;Never again&lt;/em&gt; do I want to hike this long on the Rachel Carson Trail. In 2005, 2006, and 2007, I did the full 34-mile Challenge just to prove I could, not because I actually enjoyed it as such. I don&amp;rsquo;t need to kill myself any more. I enjoy doing long, varied, meditative hikes, but there is a limit to how much I actually enjoy. 8 or 9 miles, as in the hike a month ago, is probably optimal for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew that this Rachel Carson Trail hike was going to be tough, but it got a lot tougher than I expected. I learned a lot as a result of the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Craig for checking up on us and leading the hike and Miranda for being with us on the sweep during the beginning, and thanks to Abby for taking us to the hike!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A pretty Rachel Carson Trail Challenge goal training hike (8.9 miles)</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/04/29/a-pretty-rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-hike/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 29 Apr 2012 23:22:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/04/29/a-pretty-rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-hike/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every spring, I like to do one or two of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge/rctc12/goaltraining&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Trail Challenge goal training hikes&lt;/a&gt; for fun even though I no longer do the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge/&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Trail Challenge&lt;/a&gt; because three times was enough for me. Since this year&amp;rsquo;s Challenge proceeds east to west, all of the goal training hikes this year also go east to west.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The description of today&amp;rsquo;s hike, the second of eight that increase in length till the longest one in June:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sunday, April 29, 2012&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leader: Brian Droz 412-848-4810&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8.9 miles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elevation change: 4925 ft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;On this hike we start at the Bull Creek Road checkpoint location in Tarentum and quickly encounter a steep uphill climb followed by even steeper ups and downs - including Crawford Run hill and Murray Hill. We pass through Agan Park and end in Springdale. Meet at the Springdale Veterans Association Hall parking lot in Springdale. Directions: Take Route 28 to Exit #11 (Harmarville). After exiting onto Route 910 head towards Harmarville, turn left at the second traffic light onto Freeport Road and travel about 4 miles through 9 more traffic lights. The Springdale Veterans Association Hall entrance will be on your left just past the last light. Park on the far side of the lot.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;meeting-up&#34;&gt;Meeting up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John and I drove up to the meeting place in Springdale. It was a cold morning!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m wearing my Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek shoes as I have been doing for some time now for all my hiking.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/franklin-cold.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin ready to hike&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Note: since Abby was elsewhere this morning using our camera, and my brand new smartphone&amp;rsquo;s camera had died and I was waiting for a replacement phone, John and I used his camera to take photos during the hike.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the tower that will serve as the landmark when hiking back here:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/landmark.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;hike&#34;&gt;Hike&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we carpooled to the Bull Creek Road checkpoint in Tarentum further north and east.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The start of the hike from this checkpoint is by Route 28:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/bull-creek-start.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I let John go ahead so that I could stay back and take photos without holding up anyone behind me:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/john-start.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now John has his camera back and took a photo of me going up:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/franklin-going-up.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Closeup of some garlic mustard:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/garlic-mustard-flowering.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally in the woods:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/in-the-woods.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A horse!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/horse.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A phone tower; these things prove to be useful landmarks:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/phone-tower.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A descent along a power line:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/descent.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the season for May apples:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/may-apple.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Going down and up, which is what the Rachel Carson Trail in this section is about:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/go-down-go-up.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Allegheny River is visible:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/view-of-allegeny-river.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/allegheny-river.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Emerging onto a road section of the this urban trail:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/emerging-to-road.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Stream crossing:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/stream-crossing.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/rachel-carson-trail-sign.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Looking back after finishing my very steep descent:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/very-steep-descent.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Trillium:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/trillium.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Ah, the power line experience:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/following-power-lines.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s two hours since we started hiking, and getting warmer, so my shell and hat and gloves are off. I&amp;rsquo;m wearing my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge/rctc06&#34;&gt;2006 Rachel Carson Trail Challenge&lt;/a&gt; T-shirt:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/franklin-in-rachel-carson-trail-challenge-2006-shirt.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Down and up:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/big-down-and-up.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I get things stuck between my big toe and my second toe:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/stuck-between-toes-of-kso-trek.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the less pleasant aspects of the Rachel Carson Trail is the road sections, where there is no sidewalk and the speed limit is 40 mph or higher!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/scary-road-walking.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now we&amp;rsquo;re really by the Allegheny River:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/allegheny-river-1.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/allegheny-river-2.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Red flowers (sorry, I don&amp;rsquo;t know much about flowers and do not know what they are):&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/flower.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The home stretch! See the tower that I mentioned as a landmark before the hike?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/home-stretch.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Back to the landmark:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/back-to-landmark.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The 8.9 hike took about 3:20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed doing my first Rachel Carson Trail hike of the year. Earlier in the year is better because the hikes are shorter and the weather is cooler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Brian Droz for leading this hike!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reflections on 2011</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/12/31/reflections-on-2011/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2011 18:52:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/12/31/reflections-on-2011/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I reflect on my year of 2011 as it ends. Since I did not start blogging until September, I go into more detail of what happened before then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;january&#34;&gt;January&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I continued our project of massively reorganizing our home, a project that began when she moved in during summer 2010. We were very grateful that Abby&amp;rsquo;s father helped out a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I continued getting rid of a lot of stuff, including another eighteen boxes of my books, as I became an initially reluctant &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/minimalism/&#34;&gt;minimalist&lt;/a&gt;. We sold or gave away a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; number of various of belongings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby started cooking much more than in the past, and we enjoyed trying new dishes of her making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I enjoyed some light cross-country skiing in the winter, using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schenley_Park_Golf_Course&#34;&gt;Bob O&amp;rsquo;Connor Golf Course at Schenley Park&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I began a weekly Zen &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/meditation/&#34;&gt;meditation&lt;/a&gt; session offered at Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started moving very gradually toward a &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/paleo/&#34;&gt;paleo&lt;/a&gt; diet and exercise routine, and immediately experienced benefits. &amp;ldquo;The Paleo Solution&amp;rdquo; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://robbwolf.com/&#34;&gt;Robb Wolf&lt;/a&gt; was very useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started learning modern &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/javascript/&#34;&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; for a new project at work, getting into client-side Web development. As part of that, I learned &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/jquery/&#34;&gt;jQuery&lt;/a&gt; through a free &lt;a href=&#34;http://p2pu.org/&#34;&gt;P2PU&lt;/a&gt; course and used it in the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started using &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XQuery&#34;&gt;XQuery&lt;/a&gt; at work to process XML in a clear and concise way. I had used XSLT in the past, but it was very unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decided, for various reasons, to stop writing new &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/perl/&#34;&gt;Perl&lt;/a&gt; scripts and move to &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/python/&#34;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started playing in my final (and disastrous) &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/chess/&#34;&gt;chess&lt;/a&gt; tournament, the Pittsburgh Chess Club Championship (which I had won in 2006 and 2007).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;february&#34;&gt;February&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pittsburgh was all about the Steelers, and I went to a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLV&#34;&gt;Super Bowl&lt;/a&gt; party for the first time, but we lost!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I read &amp;ldquo;The Art of Non-Conformity&amp;rdquo; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://chrisguillebeau.com/&#34;&gt;Chris Guillebeau&lt;/a&gt; and found it so inspiring that I decided to take action and start making big changes to my life, in my own way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One big change: I quit playing chess, cold turkey, after having been unenthusiastic about it for months already (and playing correspondingly poorly). When the passion and enjoyment are gone, there is no point in hanging onto something just because it has been such an important part of my life for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of not playing any music at all, I started playing &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/recorder/&#34;&gt;recorder&lt;/a&gt;, and vowed to play every single day if possible. Ten months later, I am still playing recorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I began attending a lot of &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/16/pittsburgh-software-developer-communities/&#34;&gt;local software developer group meetings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started learning the &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/scala/&#34;&gt;Scala&lt;/a&gt; programming language and decided to use it on a small project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;march&#34;&gt;March&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I continued our meditation practice at CMU, and went to our first mini-&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesshin&#34;&gt;sesshin&lt;/a&gt; on a Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I continued practicing recorder every single day, and joined the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/lukas/pcars/Welcome.html&#34;&gt;local chapter of the American Recorder Society&lt;/a&gt;. It was very exciting to meet new people and to get into a wide range of music I had never really listened to or played.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I saw a video of &lt;a href=&#34;http://jakeshimabukuro.com/&#34;&gt;Jake Shimabukuro&lt;/a&gt; playing &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/ukulele/&#34;&gt;ukulele&lt;/a&gt; so beautifully that I was inspired to buy a ukulele and start learning to play it. (Unfortunately, it would turn out that time constraints caused me not to pursue ukulele far. This will change in 2012.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got pulled into the Ruby programming language because it is well-supported on Mac OS and it is easy to install libraries and tools, of which there are many that are quite useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I went to &lt;a href=&#34;http://farmtotablepa.com/&#34;&gt;Farm to Table&lt;/a&gt; in Pittsburgh, and after that, Abby started moving toward paleo eating, with even better results than my smaller experiments earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I started our &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/hiking/&#34;&gt;hiking&lt;/a&gt; season in the spring. Hiking is special to us; it was one of our first shared activities (after initially meeting during salsa dancing), and one we return to again and again. When there is no calendar conflict and the weather is acceptable, we like hiking almost every weekend from spring through fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% img /images/steves-soup-hike-2011-03-26.jpg Abby in front of me at Steve&amp;rsquo;s Soup Hike %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;april&#34;&gt;April&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started wearing &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/fivefingers/&#34;&gt;Vibram FiveFingers shoes&lt;/a&gt; almost all the time, whether walking or running (but not yet for hiking).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I went to &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/yoga/&#34;&gt;yoga&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.clpgh.org/locations/squirrelhill/&#34;&gt;Squirrel Hill Library&lt;/a&gt; for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;may&#34;&gt;May&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I began my experiment with barefoot running, in observation of &lt;a href=&#34;http://barefootrunners.org/ibrd&#34;&gt;International Barefoot Running Day&lt;/a&gt;. I started walking around barefoot at work, ignoring the confused looks or comments of colleagues. (I still go barefoot at work.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I bought a &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/melodica/&#34;&gt;melodica&lt;/a&gt;, inspired by the amazing performances of &lt;a href=&#34;http://jnote.org/&#34;&gt;James Howard Young&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I took a little vacation, spending some days in New York visiting Nathaniel and Yael and their baby. I finally fulfilled my dream (from before marriage) of taking Abby to Coney Island to walk on the boardwalk and at the beach, eating pizza, and riding the Wonder Wheel, just as I once did when I was six years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I started doing research into major home renovations for the summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I visited my parents, and my sister Linda and her husband Andre also visited, with my mother throwing a delayed reception at home for the both of us who had gotten married in the past two years. Abby got to meet my parents&amp;rsquo; friends, finally. And I went running with my brother-in-law for the first time! Also, I took Abby to the little park in Ann Arbor where as a too-shy teenager I used to go and sit on a particular bench and wish I were sitting with my dream girl. Mission accomplished!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;june&#34;&gt;June&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John and I did a tough 19-mile training hike on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Trail&lt;/a&gt; and decided we&amp;rsquo;d had enough of that trail, and I decided I was probably not going to do the 35-mile &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Trail Challenge&lt;/a&gt; again (having completed it three times in the past).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% img /images/rachel-carson-trail-2011-06-05.jpg John on Rachel Carson Trail %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby started wearing Vibram FiveFingers more and more for walking and running, and even walking barefoot on the streets (something I had not yet seriously done myself at the time).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stupidly threw out my back during exercise, and my back took weeks to fully recover (I could still run and hike, but not lift weights). Never again, I hope. I felt like a 90-year-old when my back was hurting constantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We started some home improvement projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;july&#34;&gt;July&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started gravitating to almost exclusively body weight &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/strength-training/&#34;&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt;, as a reaction to my having injured my back earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I went kayaking on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiskiminetas_River&#34;&gt;Kiski River&lt;/a&gt; with &amp;ldquo;Fireman Steve&amp;rdquo; and the kayaking gang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a longish hike, Abby surprised me by wearing Vibram FiveFingers shoes and they worked great for her, making her much faster and less sore, and I made a note to ditch my trail running shoes (which I had been using for years for hiking) in favor of FiveFingers for my next hike (which I did, and I have not gone back to regular shoes for hiking!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I finally took Abby to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sandhillberries.com/&#34;&gt;Sand Hill Berries&lt;/a&gt; for tasty pie for the first time, always having intended to take her there when dating, but never having been in the vicinity with her then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major home renovation finally began, after much research, and we got electrical upgrade, insulation, and bathroom demolition and rebuilding. Very disruptive to our lives for weeks!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I did another mini-&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesshin&#34;&gt;sesshin&lt;/a&gt; at CMU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a lifetime of almost never drinking coffee (average of maybe three or four cups a year), I became an avid espresso fan (one small cup a day) as a result of my boss getting a machine at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started doing more barefoot running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;august&#34;&gt;August&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bathroom renovation done at last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I were regularly hiking in Vibram FiveFingers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% img /images/abby-franklin-soup-hike-vibram.jpg Abby and Franklin on Steve&amp;rsquo;s Soup Hike part 3 wearing Vibram FiveFingers %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby joined me to run in her first ever 5K race, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.runaroundthesquare.com/&#34;&gt;Run Around the Square&lt;/a&gt; in Regent Square (mostly on the trails of Frick Park). What a special day! This race was my first ever 5K race when I started running in races in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started to learn &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/accordion/&#34;&gt;accordion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;september&#34;&gt;September&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started running to work two or three times a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I ran in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kalp/PGR/&#34;&gt;CMU SCS Pretty Good Race 5K&lt;/a&gt; together, her second 5K race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I went to &lt;a href=&#34;http://podcamppittsburgh.com/&#34;&gt;PodCamp Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;, and after that, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/09/22/starting-a-new-web-site/&#34;&gt;I started this blog&lt;/a&gt; and proceeded to maintain a habit of posting every day (a routine that has been modified since then).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;october&#34;&gt;October&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started expanding beyond just writing for my blog, and began contributing to the Web through &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/franklinchen&#34;&gt;my Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; as well as writing comments on other people&amp;rsquo;s blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started taking Stanford online classes: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ml-class.org/&#34;&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.db-class.org/&#34;&gt;Introduction to Databases&lt;/a&gt;. (Blog posts on my experiences to appear soon.) Unfortunately, as a result of the extra time commitment, October through December were quite hectic for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I continued to move more toward a paleo diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;november&#34;&gt;November&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started playing &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/flute/&#34;&gt;flute&lt;/a&gt; again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably because of fatigue and a compromised immune system, I came down with a skin ailment that I got serious treatment for, but it took almost two months to completely clear up and I spent over a month truly miserable &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;december&#34;&gt;December&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started playing Baroque flute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started playing tin whistle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I prepared for and made it through two music performances, playing recorder and flute (and almost tin whistle).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ended the year completely exhausted, on the verge of getting sick, and took a long break from blogging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final week, Abby and I were on a hectic travel schedule that involved meeting up with her parents, my parents, her sister Carrie, Carrie&amp;rsquo;s boyfriend Alain, Alain&amp;rsquo;s parents, Alain&amp;rsquo;s extended family, my sister Linda, and her husband Andre. I am grateful that we got to meet up with so many people (and arranged for various of the individuals to meet up with various of the others!), but the trip was quite stressful to me, because I was not physically or emotionally prepared for it at all. (I will report later on what I learned from the experience.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2011 was quite a year for me and Abby. We had many changes and adventures in our lives: our home, our diet, our exercise, our outdoors activities, travel. For me, the biggest changes were quitting chess, starting music practice and performance, throwing myself into blogging and tweeting, getting more and more active in local software developer groups, applying new (to me) development tools at work, and in the fall, taking Stanford online courses in computer science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I ended the year in poor shape, because of being overbooked, I am very excited by how many positive changes took place. I have an entirely new set of plans and priorities to formulate soon for 2012 in collaboration with Abby, in hope of learning from the lessons of my failures and omissions of 2011, and restoring balance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
