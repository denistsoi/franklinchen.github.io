      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Relatively recently, a new English country dance music jam in the Pittsburgh area has been organized by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amarillismusic.com/aboutus.html&#34;&gt;Maro Avakian&lt;/a&gt;, whom I first met through joining in playing for the Holiday Ball &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/12/16/playing-recorder-and-flute-at-the-holiday-ball/&#34;&gt;two years ago&lt;/a&gt;. I was unable to make it to the first couple of meetings, but finally, on a nasty snowy Saturday, my schedule happened to be open, so I went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not completely new to English country dance music. It was almost two years ago when I first encountered it, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/03/31/my-first-sampling-of-english-country-dance-and-contra-dance/&#34;&gt;as a dancer&lt;/a&gt;. As has happened several times now in my life, becoming familiar with the dance got me interested in the &lt;em&gt;music&lt;/em&gt; and in the idea of actually playing the music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that I&amp;rsquo;d already played some of this kind of music for myself as a result of my study of the Baroque flute, because method books I have for the instrument include a good amount of dance music from the era. In any case, the book we use for many tunes is the volume by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.canispublishing.com/&#34;&gt;Peter Barnes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://mysite.verizon.net/peterabarnes/books.htm&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Barnes Book of English Country Dance Tunes&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, a fine anthology. Actually, I ordered my copy only last week and was lucky it arrived in the mail just in time!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://mysite.verizon.net/peterabarnes/Book1.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;instruments&#34;&gt;Instruments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a pretty good turnout given the weather. Apart from Maro on piano, we had people playing flute, Baroque flute, recorders, ukulele, mandolin, percussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d brought my flute, Baroque flute, and soprano, alto, tenor recorders, but since there were already two others on modern flute and soprano recorder, I ended up playing just the Baroque flute, alto recorder, and tenor recorder. The Baroque flute is pretty hard to play in some of the keys, and also is kind of soft, so I mostly played the alto and tenor recorders. I gradually gravitated toward improvising inner voices with the tenor recorder. I think I will do that in the future also. In addition, I should bring my bass recorder, to add a yet lower instrument to our group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;improvisation&#34;&gt;Improvisation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had great discussions about tips and tricks for improvising lines and filling out chords. Needless to say, I was botching up a lot of stuff as I experimented, but you can&amp;rsquo;t learn if you don&amp;rsquo;t try!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like I have a new musical outlet, English country dance music. I hope to continue participating in it. As with French traditional dance music, I like the improvisational nature of working with a tune with repetition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>French music jam with unexpected new musicians</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/10/15/french-music-jam-with-unexpected-new-musicians/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Oct 2012 23:45:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/10/15/french-music-jam-with-unexpected-new-musicians/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight was my fourth participation in &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/09/28/another-french-music-jam-also-announcing-cats-dance/&#34;&gt;Lisa&amp;rsquo;s French traditional dance music jam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evening started quietly, because only Lisa and John and I were present at first, and nobody else. Apparently people were either in classes or had other engagements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We always love having more people join us in making music, so it was great that unexpectedly, we got two people into playing with us before I had to leave after two hours! So where did they come from?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;three-of-us&#34;&gt;Three of us&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it was just the three of us, Lisa and John played over some new tunes they had worked on earlier, so that I could pick them up. I&amp;rsquo;m much better now at learning music by ear. I&amp;rsquo;m still not very fast at picking up tunes, but I&amp;rsquo;m definitely better. Furthermore, although they had scribbled down some scores on paper to keep track of the different new songs, I found the handwritten attempts sufficiently difficult to decipher that I chose to completely ignore them. This is a new attitude for me: in the past, I would have scrambled to get a written score if possible. Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve grown used to doing without, and not worrying about making mistakes or learning more slowly than if I had a score. It took me &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/05/14/playing-french-music-for-first-time-and-dancing-blues-for-first-time/&#34;&gt;five months&lt;/a&gt; to reach this point of relative comfort with uncertainty, confusion, and imperfection, ha!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dancers&#34;&gt;Dancers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very few dancers showed up at all during the evening. As a result, the ones that did show up expecting to dance started watching us continue to play music instead. But then John started saying, &amp;ldquo;Hey, grab an instrument and join us!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone I hadn&amp;rsquo;t met before, Georgia, had started learning some chords on mandolin recently, and she got sucked into joining us as John handed her his mandolin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, Leslie arrived. She regularly attends to dance. Since there were hardly any dancers around, we said, hey, want to play? John pointed to two banjo cases he had on the floor, so she went and tried one banjo and then switched to the other, and the next thing we knew, we were all playing together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Georgia and Leslie do play other musical instruments and sing, but they just happen not to &amp;ldquo;really&amp;rdquo; play mandolin or banjo. I thought it was pretty cool that the unfortunate lack of dancers led to their unexpectedly joining us as musicians. I guess we&amp;rsquo;ll see whether they start playing more with us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The small number of musicians and dancers might have made the evening less interesting than past sessions, but it was great that we spontaneously added to our musical group for the evening.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;On Monday I participated for my third time in Lisa&amp;rsquo;s French traditional dance music jam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/08/27/my-second-french-music-jam-playing-my-irish-flute-in-public-for-the-first-time/&#34;&gt;Last time&lt;/a&gt;, I started playing my &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/irish-flute/&#34;&gt;Irish flute&lt;/a&gt; at the jam, continued playing my &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/baroque-flute/&#34;&gt;Baroque flute&lt;/a&gt;, and left my modern flute at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, I changed things up. Also, we got a new musician playing a new instrument!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;instruments-and-musicians&#34;&gt;Instruments and musicians&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lisa was on fiddle as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we had John, who brought and used various kinds of accordions and his mandolin. (He had also brought recorders, in case I wanted to play with him, but I did not bring my recorders.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allison was on piano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donna was on fiddle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most exciting to me was that Cindy came and played &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoharp&#34;&gt;autoharp&lt;/a&gt;. I think the addition of the harmonic accompaniment and countermelodies she provided was really nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-instruments&#34;&gt;My instruments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; bring my Baroque flute this time. I made a decision this week that I was no longer going to try to play my Baroque flute in most public situations. I have been frustrated that its soft sound gets drowned out by other instruments and just by people talking and socializing at parties. Therefore, when playing the Baroque flute in public, I will reserve it for very quiet performance situations only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did bring my Irish flute, which served well when we were playing in appropriate keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have begun caving in and bringing my modern flute. It can be played more easily in all kinds of keys, and has the power to actually be heard. Maybe one day I&amp;rsquo;ll have a keyed wooden flute to play traditional music on, but that day is not near at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after some experimentation, I believe I&amp;rsquo;m come to the right instrument(s) for different situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;carnegie-alliance-of-traditional-and-social-dance-cats-dance&#34;&gt;Carnegie Alliance of Traditional and Social Dance (CATS Dance)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to take this opportunity to promote the new CMU-based dance group, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://thebridge.cmu.edu/organization/catsdance&#34;&gt;Carnegie Alliance of Traditional and Social Dance&lt;/a&gt;. Check out also their &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/catsdancepgh&#34;&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This group has been formed in order to grow a local community of people interested in all kinds of traditional and social dance, French dance being just one example; contra dancing and other folk dancing are also being explored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, this group exists because there is increasing interest among young people in these kinds of dances and music. The Pittsburgh dance scene has sometimes been dominated by older people, and it&amp;rsquo;s good to get younger people involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week CATS Dance organized an outing to the regular &lt;a href=&#34;http://pittsburghcontra.org/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Contras and Squares&lt;/a&gt; Friday dance. Tomorrow there will be a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/events/105195582969170/&#34;&gt;French dance workshop and social dance&lt;/a&gt; held directly on CMU campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These workshops and dances are, of course, open to everyone, not just CMU students. Abby and I are not CMU students, but &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/01/23/discovering-french-traditional-dance-in-pittsburgh/&#34;&gt;started attending&lt;/a&gt; these workshops at CMU in January. All ages and levels of dancers are always welcome! If you&amp;rsquo;re curious, drop by and check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first contra dance workshop to be hosted at CMU has also already been scheduled, for Sunday, October 7. Since I&amp;rsquo;ve never been to a contra dance workshop (although I had a sampling of contra dance at a birthday party &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/03/31/my-first-sampling-of-english-country-dance-and-contra-dance&#34;&gt;six months ago&lt;/a&gt;; I was very confused by it then), I hope Abby and I will make it to this workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-of-2012-10-07&#34;&gt;(Update of 2012-10-07)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/10/07/my-first-contra-dance-workshop-unexpected-fun/&#34;&gt;Abby and I did make it to the contra dance workshop&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continue to greatly enjoy the regular French music jam and meeting and playing with more musicians. Meanwhile, although I have not done much dancing lately, I am excited about the creation of CATS Dance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My second French music jam: playing my Irish flute in public for the first time</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Tonight I participated for the second time in a new little &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/groups/182324948478861/&#34;&gt;French traditional dance&lt;/a&gt; music jam session that &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/07/02/my-first-french-music-jam-anxious-but-excited/&#34;&gt;started up in July&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, I played not only my &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/baroque-flute/&#34;&gt;Baroque flute&lt;/a&gt; (which happens to be the instrument I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly been playing for the past two months), but also my &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/07/30/got-my-new-casey-burns-small-handed-irish-flute/&#34;&gt;new Irish flute I got a month ago&lt;/a&gt;. I did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; bring my modern flute at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we did the last time, after we played around for an hour or so, we then played for dancers for another hour. I enjoyed the experience a lot, and was less nervous than I was the first time. I am slowly improving at learning a tune, without a score, while someone is playing it, and then imitating the melodic line or filling in a harmonically sensible line on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;instruments-and-musicians&#34;&gt;Instruments and musicians&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally received my Irish flute a month ago and have spent some minutes every day breaking it in at home. Tonight was its &amp;ldquo;debut&amp;rdquo; in public. I enjoyed the louder, stronger sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still used the Baroque flute, for key signatures that my keyless Irish flute does not work well for (half-holing is a pain).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also had fiddles, melodeon, guitar, mandolin (not all at the same time, since John was switching between melodeon and mandolin depending on the key of the song, given the limitations of the melodeon), and I felt that the Irish flute was balanced pretty well with the other instruments, better than the Baroque flute did in the first session in July (when it was often drowned out).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We lost some musicians from last time, because one of them left town, and the clarinetist has a class in the evening and therefore cannot arrive till later, when she comes to dance. But we had two new people!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our little French music group is gaining momentum. I&amp;rsquo;m very excited! Also, as the CMU fall semester starts, there are plans to really promote French and other traditional music and dance in the form of an official CMU student organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-of-2012-09-28&#34;&gt;(Update of 2012-09-28)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/09/28/another-french-music-jam-also-announcing-cats-dance/&#34;&gt;CATS Dance successfully launched in September&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My first French music jam: anxious but excited</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/07/02/my-first-french-music-jam-anxious-but-excited/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 Jul 2012 23:45:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/07/02/my-first-french-music-jam-anxious-but-excited/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight I participated for the first time in a new local &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/groups/182324948478861/&#34;&gt;French traditional dance&lt;/a&gt; music jam session that is getting off the ground, organized by Lisa. I was really excited about the formation of our group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did this come about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;inspired-by-gregory&#34;&gt;Inspired by Gregory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happened was that after &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/05/14/playing-french-music-for-first-time-and-dancing-blues-for-first-time/&#34;&gt;Gregory left us this summer&lt;/a&gt;, I told Lisa that I really wanted to do the kind of thing Gregory had been doing, playing French music for dancers. Lisa was excited about this and thought it would be cool for herself to start playing fiddle again. She found some other people who were interested in playing French music together, and so we met up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;instruments&#34;&gt;Instruments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight, I played both my &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/baroque-flute/&#34;&gt;Baroque flute&lt;/a&gt; and my modern flute. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really want to play the modern flute, but there were times when we played some music in keys I wasn&amp;rsquo;t comfortable with on Baroque flute. Meanwhile, it will take a long time for the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/06/12/ordered-the-casey-burns-small-handed-irish-flute/&#34;&gt;Irish flute I ordered&lt;/a&gt; to be made and shipped. I really want to use the louder Irish flute when feasible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lisa had her fiddle, and someone else also had a fiddle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A guy brought his melodeon (button accordion), which unfortunately is limited in the keys it can play in. He sometimes used the old upright piano also. There was someone else who also used the piano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there was someone on clarinet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-it-went&#34;&gt;How it went&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was quite nervous, because much of what we did was not from printed scores, but from people&amp;rsquo;s memories of their favorite tunes. I in fact ended up using my phone to send Lisa a PDF of Gregory&amp;rsquo;s French music score compilation so that she could print it out for some of us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quickly noticed that my Baroque flute was being drowned out by the other instruments. So I pulled out my modern flute sometimes in order to be heard more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went on for quite some time as the dancers arrived and became restless, and then we played for them for about an hour. Actually, I was heard better then, because Lisa and some other musicians gave introductory lessons or themselves wanted to dance. The result was that after a while, it was just Donna on fiddle, John on melodeon, and me on Baroque flute playing for the dancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s really a joy playing music for people to dance to. I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m starting to fulfill my dream that &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/03/10/flute-loving-it-again/&#34;&gt;I dared to mention in March: that of being the musician rather than the dancer at a dance&lt;/a&gt;. During his time here in Pittsburgh, I was really inspired by the example of Gregory (who has finished his stay in the country and gone back to Europe) to start learning tunes by ear, ornamenting, and improvising. I&amp;rsquo;m still quite a beginner at this approach to music, but this is what I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first French music jam and new format for the French dance (live music instead of iTunes) was a great start of something new. We were all so excited that we definitely want to continue doing this. I look forward to continuing to play together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-of-2012-08-27&#34;&gt;(Update of 2012-08-27)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And less than two months later, I am &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/08/27/my-second-french-music-jam-playing-my-irish-flute-in-public-for-the-first-time/&#34;&gt;still involved in the new French music jam&lt;/a&gt;, and finally with my own Irish flute!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although I have stopped writing about it, Abby and I have continued to do &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/02/20/enjoying-more-french-dancing-in-pittsburgh/&#34;&gt;French dancing here in Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;. Tonight, for the first time, we finally attended the regular Monday night French and blues dance hosted by Lisa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was quite an intense evening for me, both playing French music &lt;em&gt;for the first time&lt;/em&gt; and dancing blues &lt;em&gt;for the first time&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;french-and-blues-social-dance&#34;&gt;French and blues social dance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;French &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; blues night?! What&amp;rsquo;s the connection?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the story is simply that Lisa and Gregory (and some other dancers) enjoy both French music/dance and blues music/dance, so both types of music and dance are combined into one evening of dancing. Of course, there are people who show up who are only interested in the French or only interested in the blues. The iTunes playlists have a mix of both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-i-wanted-to-go&#34;&gt;Why I wanted to go&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d never done blues dancing before, and was curious to see it, and maybe learn some and try it with Abby, who is also completely unfamiliar with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also: since Gregory is going back back to Europe soon, I wanted to have an opportunity to see him again before he left, and finally play French music with him. I&amp;rsquo;d never played French music before. When I told him I wanted to come and play with him for the first time, he helpfully sent me a link to his compilation of French tunes, &lt;a href=&#34;http://drawthedots.com/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Campanule&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. I feverishly tried to learn some of them before showing up. That was tricky because I wanted to play the music on my Baroque flute, an instrument that I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/04/21/my-first-time-in-a-public-music-jam-intense-fun-with-chris-norman-and-david-greenberg/&#34;&gt;still quite a beginner at&lt;/a&gt;. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to use the modern flute for this music; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t produce the kind of sound I like for traditional music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;playing-music-with-gregory&#34;&gt;Playing music with Gregory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gregory and I spent maybe ten minutes playing some of his compiled music sort of together. This was very hard for me for a number of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still pretty bad at Baroque flute, having trouble with fingerings and intonation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know the tunes very well, and was trying to find them in my printouts of his scores.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He doesn&amp;rsquo;t even look at the scores, but just plays from memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He doesn&amp;rsquo;t play exactly what was in the scores anyway, but improvises at will.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We were not coordinated, because he repeated sections or measures at will, and we didn&amp;rsquo;t really take turns or something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to come up with a secondary line or accompaniment on the fly to blend in with Gregory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As dancers started arriving and Gregory kept on playing, I stopped my feeble attempts at contributing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a way, my attempt to get into playing French music tonight was a &lt;em&gt;failure&lt;/em&gt;, but on the other hand, I actually learned a lot from observing Gregory, and knew what I had to do to be able to function as an actual musician for dancing. I had to memorize tunes, learn them by ear, get myself off the tyranny of printed scores, watch dancers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dancing-blues&#34;&gt;Dancing blues&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point, the French dance part of the evening started to end, as the demand for blues rose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to be any blues dance instruction, so Abby and I had a choice. We could just watch, or we could leave. We did do some watching, but I decided I wanted to dance, and so I just started making stuff up. I got the impression that people were basically just leading and following through improvisation similar to what I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced before when I did some Argentine tango (and a bit of Lindy hop and West Coast swing). I rather enjoy that kind of improvisational dancing, but have had little opportunity to participate in it because Abby is not used to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did do a bit of blues dancing tonight, but it&amp;rsquo;s not clear to me whether we will continue. I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in exploring blues dance further, but Abby seems less interested. People are interested in different activities; that&amp;rsquo;s just a fact of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This evening highlighted the contrast between my lack of ability to function as a practical musician for dancers and my comfort with improvisation as a dancer. I plan to work toward merging these two worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel sad that Gregory is leaving us, because I wanted to start working with him on French music, but his example has inspired me to want to continue playing French music after he is gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-of-2012-07-02&#34;&gt;(Update of 2012-07-02)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And less than two months later, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/07/02/my-first-french-music-jam-anxious-but-excited/&#34;&gt;I joined Lisa and others in playing French music together, inspired by Gregory&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Flute: loving it again, remembering why I dance, and how I met my wife!</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/03/10/flute-loving-it-again/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Mar 2012 21:28:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/03/10/flute-loving-it-again/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, after four days of &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/03/07/flute-taking-a-break-while-clarifying-my-goals&#34;&gt;not even touching my (modern) flute&lt;/a&gt; and having spent the time having fun with my Baroque flute instead, I felt the urge to return to the modern flute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have not regained the inclination to continue working on the orchestra music I still have to improve a lot on in the coming week, but I rediscovered the joy of simply playing my instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sound-intonation&#34;&gt;Sound, intonation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The perpetual challenges of getting clean sounds and accurate pitches on the Baroque flute in the past four days have given me an increased appreciation for the modern flute. I picked it up and spent time just trying to make beautiful sounds. Freed from the stress of orchestra practice, I felt much more relaxed on the instrument than I have for a while now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my surprise (but not really), I have improved considerably on the flute after not playing it for four days. I really needed a break, a consolidation of lessons learned. My production of tones is much improved, and high notes are squeaking less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;music-for-dance&#34;&gt;Music for dance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I&amp;rsquo;ve truly come to realize is that I particularly enjoy playing rhythmic music suitable for dancing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, every time I attend a dance, and there is live music, I experience a strange internal conflict: I do like to dance, but sometimes, I&amp;rsquo;d rather be on the other side of the dance floor, being the musical performer! The &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; time I&amp;rsquo;ve been on the other side has been at last year&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://pittsburghcontra.org/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Contras and Squares&lt;/a&gt; Holiday Ball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent instance of my wishing I could sometimes stop dancing and just join the musicians has been at the local &lt;a href=&#34;http://coalcountry.org/frenchdance.html&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh French dance workshop and social&lt;/a&gt;, where we&amp;rsquo;ve had live piano, fiddle, and of course, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~gdyke/&#34;&gt;Gregory&lt;/a&gt; on his Irish flute. I wonder whether at some point I might be qualified to play for the event, using either my modern flute or Baroque flute. (By the way, it was held again today, but unfortunately, Abby and I chose not to go because we had too many things to do this weekend.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;remembering-dancing&#34;&gt;Remembering dancing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I spent time playing along to a score/CD set I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned before, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/World-Music-Cuba-Flute-play-along/dp/3702465804&#34;&gt;World Music Cuba&lt;/a&gt;. While playing the bolero, cha cha, and mambo pieces in particular, I felt I was returning &amp;ldquo;home&amp;rdquo; in many ways. This was among the first music I heard and saw people dancing to when I was curious and visited the &lt;a href=&#34;http://cmubdc.org/&#34;&gt;CMU Ballroom Dance Club&lt;/a&gt; in 2000, and fell in love with, and learned to dance to. I also played along to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Play-along-Argentina-Flute-World-Music/dp/3702465871&#34;&gt;World Music Argentina&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;some-photos-of-my-ballroom-dance-days&#34;&gt;Some photos of my ballroom dance days&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some photos of me dancing in 2002 with my last dance partner, Amy, before I quit competitive ballroom dancing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we are at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dcdancesportinferno.com/&#34;&gt;DC DanceSport Inferno&lt;/a&gt; in 2002 doing a hockey stick in international rumba:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dancing-with-abby&#34;&gt;Dancing with Abby&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But never mind the ballroom dance days. It was through salsa dancing that I met my wife!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-i-met-abby&#34;&gt;How I met Abby&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was through dancing that I met Abby in the first place. After quitting dancing in 2003, I never danced again until late 2006, when my friend Jon told me he had recently started salsa dancing (because of a girlfriend who got him into it) and invited me to join him at a free outdoors dance, and I went. Then as I re-entered the Pittsburgh salsa dance scene, I kept running into Abby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;some-photos-of-us-dancing-salsa&#34;&gt;Some photos of us dancing salsa&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are not many photos of Abby dancing with me, because when I&amp;rsquo;m dancing, I&amp;rsquo;m not holding my camera, but here are some photos a friend took at a big salsa dance weekend at the Palisades in McKeesport in April 2008, a year after we started dating in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;expression-and-improvisation-in-dance-and-in-music&#34;&gt;Expression and improvisation in dance and in music&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;dance&#34;&gt;Dance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason I gave up ballroom dancing was that I felt there was an overemphasis on &amp;ldquo;syllabus steps&amp;rdquo; (I realize this is an oversimplification of the ballroom dance culture; all very good ballroom dancers go beyond the syllabus mindset). After quitting ballroom dancing, I explored Argentine tango, which is all about improvisation, but I left it because (at the time) it seemed that most of the women in the local scene were very tall, which made dancing awkward for me. I got into salsa because freed from the closed embrace, there was clearly a lot of room for personal improvisation. Ironically, I first got into making stuff up as a result of my imperfect memory: I could never memorize long choreography of step patterns, whether I was doing ballroom dancing or anything else. So I would always make a &amp;ldquo;mistake&amp;rdquo;, then I would make something out of the mistake. I learned that as long as you get back in time with the music, and keep the lead and follow communication strong, there is no such thing really as a mistake. You just keep going, with whatever is happening at the present moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now have a long-term goal of developing my technique and releasing my inhibitions so that I can improvise musically at will. Yesterday, I played with improvising when playing bolero, cha cha, and tango. It was a lot of fun and profoundly satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually credit my study of the recorder and the Baroque flute for reawakening me to my dream of free expression and improvisation. Baroque music leaves room for a lot of interpretation of trills and ornamentation and articulation (subject, of course, to &amp;ldquo;good taste&amp;rdquo;). I want to go beyond that, but it has been a great starting point. For some reason, too much exposure to later music (such as Beethoven) had turned me into a score-reader, since such later music has so much already marked up for the performer to simply &lt;em&gt;obey&lt;/em&gt;. The sparse annotations in Renaissance and Baroque music give one much more freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am enjoying playing the flute again, now that I know what I really want to do with it. And I would like to merge my dance and music lives, just as Abby has always played the Balkan music she also dances to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-of-2012-03-12&#34;&gt;(Update of 2012-03-12)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/03/12/quitting-the-cmu-all-university-orchestra-one-of-the-hardest-decisions-in-my-life/&#34;&gt;quitting the CMU AUO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost a year later, I finally played tangos on flute &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/01/26/music-i-just-played-for-the-first-time-recorder-sonata-tangos/&#34;&gt;at a party&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost exactly a year later, I ended up playing selections from the World Music Cuba book &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/03/17/finally-doing-some-latin-music-jamming-on-flute/&#34;&gt;at a party&lt;/a&gt;, and improvising freely with two other guys!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Enjoying more French dancing in Pittsburgh</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/02/20/enjoying-more-french-dancing-in-pittsburgh/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Feb 2012 01:03:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/02/20/enjoying-more-french-dancing-in-pittsburgh/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A month ago I reported on how Abby and I had our &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/01/23/discovering-french-traditional-dance-in-pittsburgh&#34;&gt;first experience of French traditional dance&lt;/a&gt;. On Saturday, we went again to Skibo Gym at Carnegie Mellon University for another fun session of French dancing from 4:00 to 7:00 PM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a great time again, and afterwards joined the instructors and some other people in having dinner at &lt;a href=&#34;http://gulliftys.us/&#34;&gt;Gullifty&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;attendance&#34;&gt;Attendance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to some familiar faces, there were many new people we hadn&amp;rsquo;t met before, and I got my office mate John to go too. Abby and I learned some dances that were not taught the last time, and we got to do more of the dances we had learned the last time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The male-female ratio was not so great this time: it would be nice to have more men attend these workshops and dances! If you are male and interested in learning French dance, come next month!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-count-bourrée&#34;&gt;3-count bourrée&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month, we had learned the 2-count bourrée, but this month we also added the 3-count. That&amp;rsquo;s really fast and was a real workout!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dances-from-last-time&#34;&gt;Dances from last time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went over the dances from last time also. Since they were no longer new to me, I felt freer to feel the music more and make the most of enjoying the dances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in a very simple circle dance, I felt like lifting my body up when we swung our arms upward, and letting my body bend naturally to the &amp;ldquo;1-2-3, down&amp;rdquo; movement. Otherwise, just stepping endlessly like a rigid robot was getting quite boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time, I was rather stiff and clumsy at the Schottische, waltz, and mazurka, because I was out of practice in these turning dances. This time I got more into the swing of things and remembered the fun I had doing ballroom dancing over ten years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were two other circle dances from last time that we did again. I really enjoy these partner switching dances. Again, since I knew the moves already, I felt freer to improve my technique and personal expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;social-dancing&#34;&gt;Social dancing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A familiar musician, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/12/16/playing-recorder-and-flute-at-the-holiday-ball/&#34;&gt;Donna Isaac&lt;/a&gt;, played fiddle for us, with Gregory on his Irish flute again. I liked the different texture from last month&amp;rsquo;s piano and flute, but I have to confess that missing a bass line made the music harder to dance to. In fact, I ended up starting to hum my own bass line to fill in the harmonies to feel less of a musical omission and help my rhythm while dancing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again I thank everyone who was at the workshop and dance. It was a great group. I am so happy to be dancing again. I had put it aside for a couple of years after Abby and I got married, but now I envision our making it a regular part of our lives again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Sorry, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/02/19/why-i-have-not-posted-many-photos-or-videos-recently-exploitation/&#34;&gt;I took no photos or videos this time&lt;/a&gt;. I spent the whole time immersed in dancing!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dinner-at-gullifty-s&#34;&gt;Dinner at Gullifty&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since people were talking about going to dinner afterwards, and this time Abby and I did not leave the dance early before it ended, we ended up joining six others for dinner. We helped pack stuff up and drove home and walked to Gullifty&amp;rsquo;s. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been there in at least ten years. It&amp;rsquo;s not my favorite idea of food, but I made the most of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ordered a &amp;ldquo;pierogie burger&amp;rdquo; for dinner. Only in Pittsburgh, ha! It was actually pretty good. It was a burger that had pierogies on top, all encased in a bun. It came with a pickle and fries. Not the kind of food I usually eat, but &amp;ldquo;cheating&amp;rdquo; once in a while is fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we &amp;ldquo;had&amp;rdquo; to have dessert. Gullifty&amp;rsquo;s is &amp;ldquo;famous&amp;rdquo; for desserts. Abby and I had reservations about continuing our &amp;ldquo;cheating&amp;rdquo; to desserts, but what the heck, we shared a triple chocolate cake. Unfortunately, we got a huge chunk of cake, as the waitress explained that it was the end of the cake so we got probably twice as much as we would ordinarily have received. We ate the whole thing, but I ended up feeling quite sugared out and bloated. That&amp;rsquo;s the punishment for &amp;ldquo;cheating&amp;rdquo; way too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;blues-and-other-dancing&#34;&gt;Blues and other dancing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People at dinner were talking about needing to take a nap afterwards and then going to a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pittsburghdancecenter.com/&#34;&gt;blues dance&lt;/a&gt; at midnight. That&amp;rsquo;s very late for Abby and me to be dancing! We&amp;rsquo;ve never done blues dancing before but are interested in trying it out sometime (but not if it&amp;rsquo;s too late at night).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dinner gang was also into Lindy hop. I did a little bit of Lindy and swing a decade ago, but never got much into it. Maybe Abby and I should check that out too. I know there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of it here in Pittsburgh. In the past, I&amp;rsquo;ve gone to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.swingpgh.com&#34;&gt;Swing City&lt;/a&gt;. There&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.coalcountry.org/swingdances.html&#34;&gt;Edgewood Club&lt;/a&gt; also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m kind of interested in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chickenswing.com/&#34;&gt;Chicken Swing&lt;/a&gt; because it meets right at Carnegie Mellon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;rsquo;s West Coast swing in town too, at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pghwcs.com/&#34;&gt;Absolute Ballroom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a lot of fun dancing with Abby more again, and also with other people, and hanging out at dinner. I am not a dance maniac any more, and time is limited, but I am excited about continuing with Abby to further explore dances we haven&amp;rsquo;t done much of before. It&amp;rsquo;s great exercise and great socializing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three months later, I ended up beginning to &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/05/14/playing-french-music-for-first-time-and-dancing-blues-for-first-time/&#34;&gt;play French music on flutes&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, Abby and I went for the first time to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/events/344055168957638/&#34;&gt;latest meeting&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=&#34;http://coalcountry.org/frenchdance.html&#34;&gt;local French traditional social dance&lt;/a&gt; workshop and dance here in Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a lot of fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;attendance&#34;&gt;Attendance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the recently fallen snow at the time (now all but melted!), around twelve of us eventually showed up, and the male-female ratio happened to be very good. For most of us, it was our first time trying out French dancing, but some of us just happened to have had prior some experience with other dancing, such as ballroom and swing and Cajun. The workshop was very friendly to beginners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dances-we-learned&#34;&gt;Dances we learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent an hour or so learning various dances, taught by Gregory Dyke and Lisa Tamres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We warmed up by learning a simple &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_dance&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;circle dance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to a waltz rhythm, and Gregory made it more challenging by having us sing along in French (which not all of us knew, but that was OK; I know some French but half the time I just hummed rather than try to sing French while doing dance steps).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we went to the partnered &lt;em&gt;waltz&lt;/em&gt;, which we did at various tempos, but all pretty fast. There was discussion of toning down the long gliding and lifting actions that some of us reflexively use from having experience with the slow waltz from ballroom dancing, because there is not enough time to use those actions for every step. (I immediately remembered being constantly reminded not to perform these actions when I was dancing &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viennese_Waltz&#34;&gt;Viennese waltz&lt;/a&gt; in my ballroom dance days. The tempo range for French waltz seems basically the same.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we learned the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schottische&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schottische&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in a variant that had a triple step, followed by a triple step, and then four single steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we changed things up to a variant of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourrée&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;bourrée&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in double time, in which there are two lines formed, and the partners facing each other alternate dancing toward each other and past each other, leaving room for personal expression as they do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We returned to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazurka&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;mazurka&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was very tricky for many of us because of the asymmetric step pattern: 1-2-hold, 1-2-3, followed by the same starting with the other foot. I still don&amp;rsquo;t completely have the hang of it, but I could feel how it could be pretty exciting because of the holding and building momentum for the second half of the pattern, on which I like to turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we learned a really fun circle dance, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mts.net/~jinks/fd/circassi.htm&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Circassian Circle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;social-dancing&#34;&gt;Social dancing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the workshop instruction, the pianist, Ellen Gozian, had arrived, and the social dance began to live music performed by her and also by Gregory on his wooden flute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About another hour of dancing followed, till it was time for Ellen to leave. Abby and I decided to leave shortly afterwards, but social dancing was going to continue with recorded music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a lot of fun exploring new dances, and would like to attend future workshops and social dances. It&amp;rsquo;s great that so many different dance and music groups exist here in Pittsburgh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am grateful to Gregory and Lisa for the instruction, Ellen for the piano playing, and every person who was on the dance floor. I think I can safely claim that everyone was smiling and laughing and having a great time at this event!&lt;/p&gt;
