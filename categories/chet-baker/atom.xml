      <title>The many faces of &#34;Stella by Starlight&#34;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I got obsessed with the classic 1944 jazz standard
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stella_by_Starlight&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Stella by Starlight&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share some very different interpretations of this music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;harry-james-1947&#34;&gt;Harry James, 1947&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the original version, not jazz, but slow, sentimental, lush: a
sentimental serenade perfect for dancing foxtrot to. Pretty good, if
you like &amp;ldquo;oldies&amp;rdquo;. And if you don&amp;rsquo;t like oldies, you need to hear this
anyway, to understand why the piece was so interesting: there is
inherently beautiful harmonic movement and color that would attract
jazz musicians to adopt this tune and transform it, and they still
continue to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/TjRMLqb6Sgs&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;miles-davis-quintet-1964&#34;&gt;Miles Davis quintet, 1964&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A really quirky version that starts with a slow intro before everyone
starts swinging, and then it goes fragmented again, and then the cycle
continues with all kinds of different ideas. Ten minutes long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Riok08Y_ri4&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tito-puente-around-1983&#34;&gt;Tito Puente, around 1983?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tito Puente and his Latin jazz band,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Camilo&#34;&gt;Michel Camilo&lt;/a&gt; on
piano. Puente himself starts off soloing on vibraphone: beautiful,
haunting rhythmic playing. Later, there is an electric guitar
solo. But mostly, this whole performance is melodic, and with its
steady and standard Afro-Cuban rhythmic drive, utterly danceable for
salsa. Something different!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the performance that inspired me to write this blog post,
because I&amp;rsquo;d never encountered this version before, but it was so
enchanting. From foxtrot original to salsa&amp;hellip; who would have thought?&lt;/p&gt;

allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;chet-baker-quartet-1987&#34;&gt;Chet Baker quartet, 1987&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Live video footage from Tokyo. Baker is near the end of his tragic
life. He starts off with a fragmentary approach, and makes use of
long-held but gently played notes that creates soft but extended
dissonances against what&amp;rsquo;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;

allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;learn-jazz-standards&#34;&gt;Learn Jazz Standards&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wonderful backing track from &amp;ldquo;Learn Jazz Standards&amp;rdquo;, not for
listening to but playing against:&lt;/p&gt;

allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day I&amp;rsquo;ll take up the challenge of improvising an own performance
of &amp;ldquo;Stella by Starlight&amp;rdquo;, but I have to confess that right now it
seems too hard for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love &amp;ldquo;Stella by Starlight&amp;rdquo;. It will endure forever as a jazz
standard, I&amp;rsquo;m sure. I hope you like it too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The beautiful, melancholy Indian Summer of Chet Baker</title>

&lt;p&gt;For some reason, today I felt like listening (for the hundredth time?) to the ballad &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Summer_%28Victor_Herbert_song%29&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Indian Summer&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; as performed by the tragically self-destructive jazz trumpet player (and vocalist) &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chet_Baker&#34;&gt;Chet Baker&lt;/a&gt;. I have been obsessed with this beautiful performance since the day I first heard it on the radio maybe fifteen years ago while driving. Eventually I got hold of a CD including the track. Thanks to YouTube, you can listen to the five-minute thing of beauty here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/_KFw6gd_66w&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;trumpet&#34;&gt;Trumpet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe &amp;ldquo;Indian Summer&amp;rdquo; came to mind today because at monthly recorder society practice, I was reflecting on my (canceled) hope to play jazz trumpet and felt a little sad. Who ever sounded as &lt;em&gt;achingly beautiful&lt;/em&gt; on trumpet as Chet Baker? Yes, I love Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, and many other greats of the trumpet, but it is always Chet Baker&amp;rsquo;s aesthetic that I identify with: the &amp;ldquo;cool&amp;rdquo;, lyrical emotional intensity. He expressed so much with drawn-out, smooth whispers and reflective silences and sighs: the lilting fragility of life, the beauty and desolation of passing through the transient stream that is Time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;voice&#34;&gt;Voice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a haunting video of Chet Baker singing the heartbreaking &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m a Fool to Want You&amp;rdquo; and playing his horn too (skip to around 0:40 for the music to begin):&lt;/p&gt;
