      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m always frustrated at this time of year because there are so many events of interest to me in Pittsburgh that seem to happen on the first weekend of October. Since I cannot attend all of them, I figured I might as well attempt a public service and mention some of them so that if you are in the Pittsburgh area, maybe you can go and enjoy what I can&amp;rsquo;t attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here are 9 of the probably dozens of cool things you could be doing tomorrow, Saturday, October 5, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;free-concert-allegheny-city-ragtime-orchestra&#34;&gt;Free concert: Allegheny City Ragtime Orchestra&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in ragtime or Latin music, check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shadysideacademy.org/page.cfm?p=12541&#34;&gt;this concert by the Allegheny City Ragtime Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some articles in anticipation of it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/ae/music/preview-ragtime-orchestra-connects-with-history-705929/&#34;&gt;Post-Gazette&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://triblive.com/aande/music/4763900-74/ragtime-music-concert&#34;&gt;Trib&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby and I wanted to go, but finally decided that we have too many other activities earlier in the day and need to just stay home and unwind in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;free-conference-podcamp-pittsburgh-8&#34;&gt;Free conference: PodCamp Pittsburgh 8&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 8th annual &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.podcamppittsburgh.com/&#34;&gt;PodCamp Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt; should be good. If you have any interest in using social media for personal or professional purposes, you should check it out. Interesting talks, opportunities to just socialized and learn new things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I attended in 2010, 2011, 2012, and will attend again for the fourth year. Unfortunately, I will only be able to attend the afternoon sessions. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to completely miss it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that PodCamp completely changed my life. For example, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/21/one-month-anniversary-of-my-blog/&#34;&gt;I started this blog in 2011 because of my second PodCamp&lt;/a&gt;, and I became serious about using social media in general, and that led to a total transformation of my life as I learned about local activities and made new friends. (Unfortunately, I didn&amp;rsquo;t get around to finishing my draft reports about my experience at last year&amp;rsquo;s PodCamp 7.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;pittsburgh-south-side-slopes-step-trek&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh South Side Slopes Step Trek&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The annual &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.southsideslopes.org/steptrek/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh South Side Slopes Step Trek&lt;/a&gt; is another event you can attend tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out my &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/08/my-god-its-full-of-stairs-pittsburgh-step-trek-2011/&#34;&gt;blog coverage two years ago&lt;/a&gt; as well as my &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/09/25/why-you-should-go-out-to-the-pittsburgh-south-side-slopes-step-trek/&#34;&gt;recent update&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Abby and I will be missing it this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;run-shadyside-5k&#34;&gt;Run Shadyside 5K&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like to run in races, a fine race is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.runshadyside.com/&#34;&gt;Run Shadyside 5K&lt;/a&gt;. Fast and flat, with a pancake breakfast and festivities afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not running in it this year, just because I have too many other things to do already for the rest of the day, but here&amp;rsquo;s my &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/01/run-shadyside-5k-outrunning-mickey-mouse-and-lending-a-trumpet/&#34;&gt;report from two years ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;free-5th-annual-wilkins-school-community-center-ecofest-in-regent-square&#34;&gt;Free: 5th annual Wilkins School Community Center Ecofest in Regent Square&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Interested in green living? Check out the &lt;a href=&#34;http://foresthills-regentsquare.patch.com/groups/around-town/p/ecofest-encourages-recycling-green-living&#34;&gt;5th annual Wilkins School Community Center Ecofest in Regent Square&lt;/a&gt;. Abby has regularly attended for the clothing swap. There will also be food, information, and entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that this year, I will also be attending, to perform as a new member of the Steel City Ukuleles. &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/08/23/another-unexpected-life-change-one-month-of-learning-to-play-ukulele/&#34;&gt;I just started playing the ukulele a bit over two months ago&lt;/a&gt;, and have been working hard to help put on an entertaining show!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll be performing around 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM. If you come, say hello!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cmu-donut-dash-2-mile-race&#34;&gt;CMU Donut Dash 2 mile race&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, if you are into weird running events, there is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://cmudonutdash.org/&#34;&gt;Carnegie Mellon University Donut Dash&lt;/a&gt;, a 2 mile event serving as a fundraiser for the Children&amp;rsquo;s Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC. This is not an event I have ever done, and not one I intend to do, but what the heck, some of you might love this sort of thing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;national-chess-day-gateway-open-tournament-at-the-pittsburgh-chess-club&#34;&gt;National Chess Day: Gateway Open tournament at the Pittsburgh Chess Club&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that it&amp;rsquo;s time for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nationalchessday.com/&#34;&gt;National Chess Day&lt;/a&gt;? There will be a tournament at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://pittsburghcc.org/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Chess Club&lt;/a&gt;, the 56th annual Gateway Open. Yes, chess in Pittsburgh has a long and illustrious history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;pittsburgh-perl-workshop&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Perl Workshop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a Perl programmer, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://pghpw.org/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Perl Workshop&lt;/a&gt; is back &lt;a href=&#34;http://pghpw.org/ppw2013/&#34;&gt;this year&lt;/a&gt;. Registration is already closed, so it&amp;rsquo;s not so helpful right now for me to mention it, but in case you didn&amp;rsquo;t know it existed, watch for it next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ninth-thing&#34;&gt;Ninth thing?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, I guess I miscounted. But there are a whole lot more than nine things to do in Pittsburgh tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you are interested in some free stuff to do, there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.radworkshere.org/interior.php?pageID=64&#34;&gt;RADical Days&lt;/a&gt; listing a whole bunch of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no shortage of stuff to do in this great city of Pittsburgh at any time or day of year. I think it&amp;rsquo;s unfortunate that many things I like to do happen to repeatedly fall on the first Saturday of the year, but I&amp;rsquo;m not complaining about an embarrassment of riches. Go out and take advantage of what I can&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PodCamp Pittsburgh 7: review</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/10/28/podcamp-pittsburgh-7-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Oct 2012 16:30:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;This year, I attended the two-day &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.podcamppittsburgh.com/&#34;&gt;PodCamp Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt; yet again, for my third year in a row (and this is the seventh year of its existence). (I wrote a little bit about last year&amp;rsquo;s PodCamp Pittsburgh (6) &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/21/one-month-anniversary-of-my-blog/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year&amp;rsquo;s theme was &amp;ldquo;Build your digital toolbox&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, I got Abby to come with me to part of it to see what it was about, since I had raved about 5 and 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emphasis of PodCamp Pittsburgh has been changing with time. I noticed that in the session descriptions. The previous two years had more of a personal focus while now, there is a lot of business interest. Still, I found useful advice while attending this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Videos from PodCamp Pittsburgh 7 are available &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS4FjD4nMvYNjjHGK1j2lFs3DUnfEurtR&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-of-2014-01-16&#34;&gt;(Update of 2014-01-16)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an unfinished post that is one of many in the past two years that lay unfinished because I had originally planned to write a very detailed report but never got around to it. I decided that I might as well release all these unfinished posts rather than leave them completely out of the record.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Celebrating this blog&#39;s one-year anniversary</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/09/22/celebrating-this-blogs-one-year-anniversary/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;One year ago, I started this blog, inspired by my attending &lt;a href=&#34;http://podcamppittsburgh.com/&#34;&gt;PodCamp Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to write up a lengthy retrospective today, because I have to go soon to a concert Abby will be in tonight, as part of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pittsburghmandolinsociety.org/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Mandolin Society orchestra&lt;/a&gt; in Synod Hall. It was interesting rereading my own &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/21/one-month-anniversary-of-my-blog/&#34;&gt;one-month retrospective from last year&lt;/a&gt;: I&amp;rsquo;ve learned so much about myself, and other people, and changed so much, during the past year of writing here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I will say for now is: &lt;em&gt;I will continue to write for an online audience, and I expect to do this for the rest of my life&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;podcamp-pittsburgh-reminder&#34;&gt;PodCamp Pittsburgh reminder!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PodCamp Pittsburgh 7 is happening later this year than it did last year; it is coming October 27-28. There is still a &lt;a href=&#34;http://podcamppittsburgh.com/pcpgh7-speaker-submission/&#34;&gt;call for speakers&lt;/a&gt;. I remember last year some of the guys who inspired me had joked that I should start a blog and then come back the following year to talk about it. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I&amp;rsquo;m ready to do that yet, but at least it no longer sounds at all like a crazy idea!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;think-about-it&#34;&gt;Think about it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t attended PodCamp Pittsburgh before, check it out! Registration is open, and the whole weekend is &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt;! Unbelievable value for something that &lt;em&gt;changed my life forever&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Liebster Blog Award: 5 blogs you should check out</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/01/29/liebster-blog-award-5-blogs-you-should-check-out/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2012 13:04:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/01/29/liebster-blog-award-5-blogs-you-should-check-out/</guid>
      <description>&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/liebster-award.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Liebster Blog Award&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Recently, my neighbor gave me a Liebster Blog Award. This is actually my second one, but I had not yet claimed the first one, under the rules of acceptance of the award. I&amp;rsquo;ve had difficulty finding the origin of this award and the official documentation of the award, but from what I can tell, the rules are that I must give the award to five other bloggers who have fewer than 200 followers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thank the giver and link back to the blogger who gave it to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reveal your top five picks and let them know by leaving a comment on their blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy and paste the award on your blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have faith that your followers will spread the love too!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here goes, starting with identifying the two people who gave me the award:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-two-who-gave-me-an-award&#34;&gt;The two who gave me an award&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;dana-dana-is-a-geek-http-danaisageek-com&#34;&gt;Dana: &lt;a href=&#34;http://danaisageek.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dana is a Geek&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first person to give me the Liebster award is a Pittsburgh local, Dana, who is actually inadvertently responsible for my getting into social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, through her talk on &lt;a href=&#34;http://hootsuite.com/&#34;&gt;HootSuite&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;http://podcamppittsburgh.com/&#34;&gt;PodCamp Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt; 5, in 2010. I still use HootSuite to this day. I also stopped by her talk yet again last year at PodCamp Pittsburgh 6 for a refresher, and it was actually after that when I finally decided to get serious about Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/DIuG4G8hOzY?list=PL6F136EEC5F65EBDA&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dana gave me the award back &lt;a href=&#34;http://danaisageek.com/2011/11/23/liebster-blog-awar/&#34;&gt;in November&lt;/a&gt;, but I was crazy busy then and decided to put off the hard work of properly accepting the award; that task went deep into my stack of to-do items, but has finally been taken out of the stack!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dana, like me, started blogging in earnest after PodCamp Pittsburgh 6. She writes on a variety of topics, including the cool activities she does with her kids, comments on current events she feels strongly about, and reflections on learning and living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;becca-the-earthling-s-handbook-http-articles-earthlingshandbook-org&#34;&gt;Becca: &lt;a href=&#34;http://articles.earthlingshandbook.org/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Earthling&amp;rsquo;s Handbook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Becca is my next-door neighbor. She gave me the award just over &lt;a href=&#34;http://articles.earthlingshandbook.org/2012/01/20/liebster-blog-award/&#34;&gt;a week ago&lt;/a&gt;, not knowing that I already had been given the award (but not yet accepted it!). After that, there was no way I could postpone indefinitely my acceptance of the award.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Becca writes about all kinds of things she cares about, including her journey as she raises her son, her family&amp;rsquo;s experiments in healthy and tasty cooking, and her commitment to an environmentally sound way of living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;criteria-for-choosing-five-blogs-to-give-the-liebster-award-to&#34;&gt;Criteria for choosing five blogs to give the Liebster award to&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve postponed choosing five blogs to give the Liebster award to because of the constraints. I follow a good number of blogs, but most of them are quite popular and probably have a lot more than 200 followers. Nobody knows exactly how many followers a blog has, but I understand that the spirit of the award is to give it to people whose blogs are not so widely followed. I don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily know whether a particular blog is widely followed, but I&amp;rsquo;ll go by my gut feel of how popular a blog might be (based on number of comments, whether the site also has mailing lists, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have in mind that ideally I should pick blogs that my readers are likely to find useful and read. However, my readers have diverse interests, so I should pick blogs that give at least some representation of the different interests, e.g., I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t pick blogs just dedicated to Pittsburgh or software development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen blogs that are pretty active or hope to encourage to become more active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;five-blogs-for-you-to-check-out&#34;&gt;Five blogs for you to check out&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;outside-my-window-http-www-wqed-org-birdblog&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wqed.org/birdblog/&#34;&gt;Outside My Window&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This local blog is very active, and written by Kate St. John, who apparently works at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wqed.org/&#34;&gt;WQED&lt;/a&gt; in Pittsburgh. I have never met her, but enjoy her blog because she posts photos all the time of nature, especially birds and trees, along with interesting information and musings of hers. Following her blog is like following the local seasons. If you live in our part of the country, you should definitely subscribe to her blog and get a daily treat!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;andrew-cox-http-andrewcox-org&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://andrewcox.org/&#34;&gt;Andrew Cox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a local personal blog by Andrew Cox, a software developer whom I must have first encountered probably no more than a year or so ago, at a &lt;a href=&#34;http://pghrb.heroku.com/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Ruby&lt;/a&gt; meeting. Amusingly, I got to know him better largely through his blog and Twitter, although nowadays I run into him often in the Pittsburgh software developer user group scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out we have various interests in common beyond being practicing software developers. Andrew is passionate about both learning and teaching in the most general sense. We also pursue health and fitness experiments to improve ourselves. He writes about all these subjects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrew tends not to post on his blog very often, but usually when he does, he writes long, substantial articles that deserve close reading. So subscribe to his blog, and when he isn&amp;rsquo;t posting, check out his archives too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;well-i-m-back-http-robert-ocallahan-org&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://robert.ocallahan.org/&#34;&gt;Well, I&amp;rsquo;m Back&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This personal blog is written by Rob O&amp;rsquo;Callahan, an old &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/roc/public/www/index.html&#34;&gt;computer science&lt;/a&gt; classmate of mine. He is from New Zealand and loves it so much that he moved back sometime after coming to the United States for grad school and work. He has strong opinions about everything and writes about many things, including his &lt;a href=&#34;http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/news/mozillas-nz-boss-works-to-keep-the-web-wide-open&#34;&gt;working for Mozilla&lt;/a&gt; as a practicing advocate of open Web standards and browsers, technical tidbits, comments on culture, and his outings at home, complete with the breathtaking photos that are why I enjoy following his blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before meeting Rob long ago, I&amp;rsquo;d always wanted to visit New Zealand, but seeing his photos regularly keeps reminding me that Abby and I must go some day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;software-carpentry-http-software-carpentry-org-blog&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://software-carpentry.org/blog/&#34;&gt;Software Carpentry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog is very active, and written by Greg Wilson (whom I do not know), the project lead for the Software Carpentry project, whose goal is to help scientists (and others who are not professional software developers) learn and improve their software development skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes Software Carpentry special is the strong emphasis on actually making use of empirical educational research, trying out ideas to see if they work, and maintaining an open source philosophy of sharing and building community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I follow this blog because I have a long-term interest in helping non-specialists learn computer science and programming. Especially given the very recent craze over &lt;a href=&#34;http://codecademy.com/&#34;&gt;Codecademy&lt;/a&gt; and other &amp;ldquo;learn to code&amp;rdquo; initiatives, I think it is very important to be informed on what insights people who have been teaching programming for many years now have to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how many followers this blog has, and therefore whether it qualifies under the terms of the Liebster Award, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to assume that it should be read more than it is, by anyone who cares about the hard task of bringing computational fluency to everyone who can benefit from it, not just those studying for a computer science degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;mathbabe-http-mathbabe-org&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mathbabe.org/&#34;&gt;mathbabe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very active blog by Cathy O&amp;rsquo;Neil, who is a mathematician (formerly in academia and formerly in a hedge fund), a mother, an activist. She writes about whatever is on her mind. She has strong opinions and sometimes uses strong language. Much of what she writes about has a quantitative bent, e.g., her explorations of economics, finance (including her involvement with Occupy Wall Street), programming with Python and R; but she has also written about being a female geek and math education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like real-time exploration of serious issues, and don&amp;rsquo;t mind seeing strong opinions (especially political) you may or may not agree with, check out her blog!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon deciding on five blogs to bestow the Liebster award on, I hereby finally accept the Liebster award for myself, and I thank all of you who read my blog and hope you check out the blogs I have recommended! (I also hope the recipients come up with their own lists for us all to check out.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>One month anniversary of my blog</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I created this blog one month ago, on &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/09/22/starting-a-new-web-site/&#34;&gt;September 22&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have achieved my short-term milestone of creating at least one post every day. This has not been a trivial task, and there have been times when I felt pressed for time or tired or was not excited about deciding what to write about and then doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I knew I had to develop the habit, and overcome perfectionism, and just get going. I&amp;rsquo;ve known too many people who started a blog, posted to it exuberantly for a while, and then didn&amp;rsquo;t continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some ways I have managed to go an entire month so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;advice-from-podcamp-pittsburgh-6&#34;&gt;Advice from PodCamp Pittsburgh 6&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began my new blog only after having attended &lt;a href=&#34;http://podcamppittsburgh.com/podcamp-pittsburgh-6/pcpgh6-sessions/&#34;&gt;PodCamp Pittsburgh 6&lt;/a&gt; and listening to enough advice that I had a strategy planned to get a strong start. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t start a new business without having an idea what I was doing, nor would I start a new computer program without having some tools and goals in mind, and writing for a blog is no different as a demanding enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;social-storytelling-by-shawn-graham-and-tom-kubilius&#34;&gt;Social storytelling, by Shawn Graham and Tom Kubilius&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to thank &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/shawngraham&#34;&gt;Shawn Graham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/tomkubilius&#34;&gt;Tom Kubilius&lt;/a&gt; for their session on &amp;ldquo;social storytelling&amp;rdquo;. To tell the truth, there is much they said (that I took notes on) that I have not yet implemented, but here is some of what I have consciously put into practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-do-i-care-about&#34;&gt;What do I care about?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shawn and Tom repeatedly emphasized knowing your &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; and what you care about. So when I write, I really do write about what I care about. There are a lot of things I could write about, but don&amp;rsquo;t, because I don&amp;rsquo;t really care about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This piece of advice has helped me stay focused on what I care about rather than what might be easy for me to write about but with less or no passion. For example, instead of writing about something I already know well, I&amp;rsquo;ll write about something I&amp;rsquo;m discovering and learning &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;. Since I do not really care much about the past, I do not bring it up unless it is a relevant prelude to a story from &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;be-committed-and-be-regular&#34;&gt;Be committed, and be regular&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where I got my idea of &lt;em&gt;committing&lt;/em&gt; to post &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; day. They didn&amp;rsquo;t tell anyone how often to be posting, but I decided on that schedule for myself, knowing that the more spaced out a new activity is, the less likely I can keep it going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;be-social&#34;&gt;Be social&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shawn put up a nice blog post shortly after PodCamp Pittsburgh 6 that discussed the &lt;a href=&#34;http://shawngraham.me/index.php/blog/the-golden-rule-of-successful-social-engagement&#34;&gt;golden rule of social engagement&lt;/a&gt;. My online activity cannot exist in a vacuum. For many years, I lurked and read a lot online but never commented. I&amp;rsquo;ve changed that &amp;ldquo;anti-social&amp;rdquo; behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, when I am reading a blog, and feel compelled to respond to a post, I strongly consider doing so if I feel I can maybe make a contribution. At times, I just submit a short comment at the article&amp;rsquo;s commenting system. Other times, I write my own article and post the URL of it as a comment. I find it useful to be inspired by some topic of discussion that other people already care out and started to talk about. Even if things do not progress beyond just my leaving a note, I know that I have planted a seed, and since the web is forever, the conversation can always be started back up by someone sometime later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(By the way, I am working on a blogroll of recommended sites I will put up on my web site.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;blogging-201-by-burghbaby-and-firemom&#34;&gt;Blogging 201, by @burghbaby and @FireMom&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At PodCamp Pittsburgh 6, I also attended &amp;ldquo;Blogging 201&amp;rdquo; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/burghbaby&#34;&gt;@burghbaby&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/FireMom&#34;&gt;@FireMom&lt;/a&gt;, another very informative session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/HwmsFdxsJmU?list=PL6F136EEC5F65EBDA&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;why-answers-a-lot&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why&amp;rdquo; answers a lot&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theme was repeated that a blogger should know the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; of what they&amp;rsquo;re doing, because all kinds of questions or dilemmas can be answered that way: frequency, tone, topics, appropriate language, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started writing only after knowing I had some pretty strong intuitions of why I&amp;rsquo;m doing it. Still, recently I have been thinking of tightening up those intuitions even further, and writing up a really specific &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; page to put up on my site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;finding-fodder&#34;&gt;Finding fodder&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The session had a ton of good advice on this topic.  I&amp;rsquo;ll just mention one of the useful points: keeping track of ideas to later write about. I keep a log of ideas that come to me (in fact, one just came to me when I was last in the shower), so that I have no shortage of topics to write about in case I either come up dry (as far as exciting experiences during a day) or find some connection with some other idea I want to write about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;blogging-boundaries-by-miss-britt&#34;&gt;Blogging boundaries, by Miss Britt&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PodCamp session by &lt;a href=&#34;http://miss-britt.com/&#34;&gt;Miss Britt&lt;/a&gt; was very energetic and insightful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-is-your-intent&#34;&gt;What is your intent?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britt noted that once upon a time, she used her blog to vent, and that led to a lot of trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to keep this in mind when I&amp;rsquo;m writing about something and I might be feeling annoyed. I think that my tone in a few of my posts so far has veered slightly into &amp;ldquo;venting&amp;rdquo; territory, but that is not where I intend to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;live-a-life-worth-writing-about&#34;&gt;Live a life worth writing about&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advice to have a life to write about somehow really stuck with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On days when I do something new and exciting, it is usually pretty easy to write something about it. So if I&amp;rsquo;ve run in a 5K race or tried a new recipe when cooking or learned something at a seminar, it&amp;rsquo;s fairly easy for me to write a post about my experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I even joked to a friend that I was engaged in &amp;ldquo;Blog-Driven Living&amp;rdquo;. Of course, it was just a joke: I have never done something arbitrary just to have something to write about, and never will. But interestingly, a different dynamic has developed: sometimes when there is a project I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to start, or complete, but have put off, I realize, &amp;ldquo;It would be nice if I actually got my act together and did it, so that I could write about it&amp;rdquo;, and do it! Blogging has actually improved my offline productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lunch&#34;&gt;Lunch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last day of PodCamp Pittsburgh 6, I was eating lunch and &lt;a href=&#34;http://justinkownacki.com/&#34;&gt;Justin Kownacki&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.robjdic.com/&#34;&gt;Rob de la Cretaz&lt;/a&gt; happened to sit near me. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t talking with them (to be honest, I was dead tired from the weekend and was just trying to eat my lunch alone and then take a long nap immediately afterwards), but overheard them discussing the past, present, and future of PodCamp Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I piped in, saying I had come the previous year, and learned some things but had not yet started the blog I wanted to start. They basically just said, do it, and don&amp;rsquo;t worry about whether it&amp;rsquo;s perfect right off the bat. Just get started, now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me several days to make the plunge, but I did do it. Thanks again, Justin and Rob!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;seth-godin&#34;&gt;Seth Godin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I must mention Seth Godin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/&#34;&gt;Seth Godin&lt;/a&gt; is my hero. He&amp;rsquo;s written a bunch of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/books.asp&#34;&gt;books&lt;/a&gt;, some of which I&amp;rsquo;ve actually read or browsed, before discovering his &lt;a href=&#34;http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, which I recommend subscribing to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very day after I started my blog, I saw his post on &lt;a href=&#34;http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/09/talkers-block.html&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;talker&amp;rsquo;s block&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and have had it in my web browser as a &amp;ldquo;permanent tab&amp;rdquo; since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Godin basically says, we don&amp;rsquo;t have talker&amp;rsquo;s block, so why should we have writer&amp;rsquo;s block? Reflecting on this, I knew that I was going to write as though I were talking. So here I am. The quality of my blog posts has varied. I know that. But that&amp;rsquo;s OK, because what matters is where I am and where I am going, not where I have been. I know I will improve considerably with time and experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One month of blogging, and I&amp;rsquo;m still at it, and still striving to improve at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, everyone, for your help!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am starting a brand new web site here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Update from 2011-10-21: check out my &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/21/one-month-anniversary-of-my-blog/&#34;&gt;one-month retrospective post&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big &amp;ldquo;thank you&amp;rdquo; to everyone at &lt;a href=&#34;http://podcamppittsburgh.com/&#34;&gt;PodCamp Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt; who inspired me to finally come up with a plan to start blogging for real!&lt;/p&gt;
