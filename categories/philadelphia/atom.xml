&lt;p&gt;I went to my first ever Scala conference, &lt;a href=&#34;http://nescala.org/&#34;&gt;NE Scala&lt;/a&gt;, held in Philadelphia, with Josh and Jamie, as mentioned in my report on &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/01/11/2013-is-my-year-of-scala/&#34;&gt;the very first Pittsburgh Scala meetup group meeting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was intense. Being a novice to Scala, most of the talks I attended covered stuff completely new to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I returned determined to dig deeper into the Scala ecosystem and use the language effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;videos&#34;&gt;Videos&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Videos of the talks are available at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLndbWGuLoHeaOpTHoNhelI4NdnSqpeXA7&#34;&gt;this play list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, &lt;a href=&#34;http://scalawags.tv/scalawags-live-at-ne-scala&#34;&gt;an episode of Scalawags was recorded live at NE Scala&lt;/a&gt; and does not appear in that play list. I was present and thought it was a very useful question and answer session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-of-2014-01-16&#34;&gt;(Update of 2014-01-16)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an unfinished post that is one of many in the past two years that lay unfinished because I had originally planned to write a very detailed report but never got around to it. I decided that I might as well release all these unfinished posts rather than leave them completely out of the record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, almost a year later, I am still using Scala. I really did stop writing new Java code at work and switch to Scala.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NE Scala 2014 registration recently opened up; unfortunately, it is in New York City, far away, and space is limited, so I am not attending.&lt;/p&gt;
