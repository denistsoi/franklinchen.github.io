      <title>My Rachel Carson Trail hike for the year (13.4 miles): and how this is about love and gratitude</title>

      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/05/12/my-rachel-carson-trail-hike-for-the-year/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I did my first hike of the year (normally I would have done hiking already in the spring, but the combination of Abby&amp;rsquo;s broken foot and my Pittsburgh Marathon training this year resulted in no space for hiking until after the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/05/06/2013-pittsburgh-marathon-my-135th-race-was-my-worst-i-finished/&#34;&gt;marathon, which I did seven days ago&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first hike of the year just happened to turn out to be a grueling Rachel Carson Trail hike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, I reported on the two Rachel Carson Trail Challenge goal training hikes I did in &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/04/29/a-pretty-rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-hike/&#34;&gt;late April&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/06/03/a-totally-exhausting-rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-hike/&#34;&gt;early June&lt;/a&gt;. This year, I did the fourth of eight of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge/rctc13/goaltraining&#34;&gt;year&amp;rsquo;s goal training hikes&lt;/a&gt; offered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sunday, May 12&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leader: Donna Stolz 412-303-6102, Eileen Lessman 412-760-8863&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;13.4 miles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elevation change: 5055 ft&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This hike begins in North Park and heads over to Emmerling Park, then up and over Rich Hill and Lefever Hill. We end at the Log Cabin Road checkpoint location. Meet at Log Cabin Road parking area. Take Route 28 to Exit #12. Turn right at the end of the ramp, then right at the stop sign onto Little Deer Creek Road (aka Russellton Road). Travel about 1.5 miles and turn right on Log Cabin Road. Park about 100 yards ahead on the right.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of this year, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to do &lt;em&gt;only one&lt;/em&gt; Rachel Carson Trail hike a year, so this was it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my report on the hike, as well as my long-awaited explanation of why this trail means so much to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;weather&#34;&gt;Weather&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conditions were good. It was kind of chilly and windy, probably 45-50 degrees throughout the hike. The sun came and went. There were only short periods of light drizzling rain, thankfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;footwear&#34;&gt;Footwear&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek shoes I wore last year on the Rachel Carson Trail developed holes, as a result of which I &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/08/28/five-reasons-we-just-stocked-up-on-vibram-fivefingers-kso-trek-shoes/&#34;&gt;stocked up on some new ones&lt;/a&gt;. The pair that I opened, I&amp;rsquo;ve worn only a couple of times, and I wore this pair today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;comparison-with-last-year-s-hike&#34;&gt;Comparison with last year&amp;rsquo;s hike&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/06/03/a-totally-exhausting-rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-hike/&#34;&gt;Last year on the 18.1 mile hike&lt;/a&gt;, I was stupid about my smartphone, and this year I was smarter. Today&amp;rsquo;s hike was a shorter 13.4, so I was sure the battery would last long enough, if I didn&amp;rsquo;t take photos with flash. And of course, I always have a phone charge in my car now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year&amp;rsquo;s hike went east to west and ended in North Park. This year&amp;rsquo;s hike went west to east and started in North Park. But being shorter, it did not end in Springdale. It is really a different hike when you go on the same trail but in a different direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might enjoy comparing the photos in different directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;meeting-up-at-log-cabin-road&#34;&gt;Meeting up at Log Cabin Road&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John and I arrived on time but not early, which meant that when we arrived, we saw a whole contingent of people already carpooling to head to North Park. We never saw those people again. Oops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, although we were ready to go with the hike leader, Donna, latecomers kept on showing up, and we were lenient and waited for them, before all the rest of us remaining headed to North Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waiting for latecomers:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.03.20.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Because of Route 910 closures, some detours were necessary as Donna&amp;rsquo;s husband drove us to North Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hike&#34;&gt;Hike&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In North Park about to begin:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.45.23.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.45.26.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;By the time we started, there were only a handful of us together as a group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was momentarily confused because I saw someone running in the &lt;em&gt;wrong direction&lt;/em&gt; on the trail and thought she might be one of us, and was worried. I tried to follow her to call out to her, but she disappeared quickly:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.45.34.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Donna called out to me, and I rejoined the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In North Park, a few sections of the trail are on the road, but then we go into the woods for real:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.51.43.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.51.49.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.52.15.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a whole bunch of stream crossings while in North Park. Some of them are easier than others. I should note that one of the harder ones had some fast water and basically ensured that your feet would get wet, because the logs were floating and not completely safe to step on. Some people jumped, but that&amp;rsquo;s not safe. Wearing KSO Trek shoes, since the temperature was around 50, I was fine just getting my feet wet by walking through the water.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.05.16.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.05.22.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.10.50.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.10.56.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Out of the woods onto the railroad tracks (note that hiking in the reverse direction is tricky because it&amp;rsquo;s not well-marked where to get off the railroad tracks into the woods; John and I got lost the last time we did the reverse hike and had to backtrack!).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.18.50.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.19.23.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a good amount of road walking on this section of the Rachel Carson Trail.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.27.01.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.27.14.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.29.46.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.53.40.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Crossing Route 8:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.03.01.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally, the power lines:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.04.28.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.05.59.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.22.47.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I am a bit sentimental about this section of trail in Hampton Park because Abby and I have done some cross country skiing here in winter, when she used to live up here before we got married and she moved to Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.29.52.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Abby and I have also hung out here in the past watching birds.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.32.38.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.37.55.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.41.13.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.48.38.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.49.37.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.54.37.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here is where John and I got lost. I was distracted by this sight and made a turn toward it (the trail turned in the opposite direction) to check it out:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.55.25.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;OK, &amp;ldquo;acidic condensate collection tank&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.56.02.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Hmm, this didn&amp;rsquo;t look familiar.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.57.12.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_11.05.31.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;John and I turned back. We lost about ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_11.06.42.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_11.07.38.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_11.15.12.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_11.18.16.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;No animals out and about today!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_11.41.38.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_11.43.09.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Funny how this happens to me once or twice each hike:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.01.43.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What the heck is this going on?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.07.33.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Uphill.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.07.53.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.11.35.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.19.47.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally at Emmerling Park, about 3 hours and 45 minutes into the hike.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.28.15.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I hung out at Emmerling Park for about ten or fifteen minutes, using the restroom and then playing on the swing relieving my aching feet while waiting for John and the others to catch up and also use the restroom. The truth is, I was ready to stop hiking already, feeling tired. I was also sore because of two falls I had sustained earlier in the hike. One of the falls involved my tripping on my right foot, causing me to land hard on my left, reinjuring my left knee that I had hurt before the marathon in a fall down the stairs. My left knee was causing me serious pain again now in the hike. I also fell on a steep downhill earlier, landing directly on my butt and on the palm of my left hand, which reinjured my left elbow. Finally, my right Achilles was killing me, because I had not adjusted the strap of my shoe properly; I had readjusted it during the hike, but the damage was already done. I was quite ready to stop hiking, but there were still two hours to go! Oops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Red flower:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.49.45.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.49.54.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And now we got to sections of the trail that are abused by ATVs and rutted and muddy. (We ended up encountering someone on an ATV, in fact.)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_13.02.18.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Standing water:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_13.05.17.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No fun at all hiking through these muddy ruts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally back into open space:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back down the big hill:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s John and the rest down at the bottom:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally back to the parking lot!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_14.25.11.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;after&#34;&gt;After&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hiked something like 5 hours and 45 minutes. It felt really long to us, as our first hike of the year. My feet were killing me. I was happy to take my shoes off and drive us back home barefoot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, my phone still barely had battery power left when we finished. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure it would have lasted another hour. This is useful to know. Of course, I immediately plugged it into my car charger! I should get an extra battery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-hike-this-trail-at-all&#34;&gt;Why hike this trail at all?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby is confused why I like occasionally (once or twice a year) hiking on the Rachel Carson Trail, even though much of the time I find it tiring and weird. I&amp;rsquo;ve never fully explained this in words, so here, finally, is my explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have many sentimental reasons to hike this trail. One is that eight years ago, in late May of 2005, when a local running friend said he was doing the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge/rctc05&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Trail Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, I had taken an entire half year off from running was feeling sad and lonely. I looked up the Challenge online, and happened to find that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge/rctc05/training&#34;&gt;training hikes led by Barb Peterson&lt;/a&gt; were being offered in just a few days, and although I had no intention whatsoever to do the Challenge, I thought the training hikes would be a fun way to do and see something different. After doing the third of four, I was so excited by the novelty that I ended up signing up for the Challenge!! With only three weeks left, there was not much training I could do for it, but I figured that if I just took it slowly, I should be able to finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2005 Challenge was an ordeal for me to finish, but I did, and the side effect was that I fell in love with hiking in general. I met people through doing the Challenge, and in 2006 I roped John into joining me on some longer training hikes, where we met more people, and some of them I began hiking with outside the context of the Challenge, in places like the Laurel Highlands. This was before the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/pittsburghhikers/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Hiking Meetup&lt;/a&gt; was formed in May 2007 and made it much easier to find people to hike with. So the 2005 Challenge had the side effect of getting me into making hiking a regular part of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, as I was training for the 2007 Challenge, that was the time when I had just met Abby and was dancing with her, but we were not dating yet. When we were chatting at a salsa dance, I learned that she liked to hike and was intrigued. I invited her to join me and John for an April 29 Rachel Carson Trail Challenge training hike that happened to be passing through Hampton (as today&amp;rsquo;s hike did), and she said she would join us for part of it. A comic series of events then took place, in which John and I arrived at Hampton earlier than she had expected, so she had not yet made it to Hampton to meet up with us. When I paused to call her, and she said she would meet us in the trail, John and I got confused and lost because of miscommunication. I kept having to call her again and again until we finally found her, and she set us straight back onto the trail and hiked with us for a bit before turning back. That was my first interaction with Abby outside of dancing; I got to see how she gracefully handled my clumsy mistakes during this outing and how helpful she was. It was a month after that when we finally started dating. Eventually, I proposed right after a hike led by one of the guys I originally first met through a Rachel Carson Trail Challenge training hike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I associate the Rachel Carson Trail not only with falling in love with hiking, and with meeting lots of interesting people I still hike with all these years later, but also I am reminded of how I fell in love with Abby and how hiking is a big part of what we have done and do. It is slightly ironic, of course, that she does not enjoy doing most sections of the Rachel Carson Trail, so in recent years I have been hiking it either alone or with John. And that is why I try to limit how often I hike on the trail; I&amp;rsquo;ve decided now to do it only once a year, so that I spend less time on hiking that Abby doesn&amp;rsquo;t do with me, in order to share more hiking with her. But I would like to spend good time on the trail once a year from now on to remember what it means to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, despite the strange hybrid nature of the trail, I believe in its existence and maintenance. It is a reminder that even in urban/suburban environments, there is still an underlying primitive nature that we can enjoy. The volunteers of the Rachel Carson Trails Conservancy work hard to keep this unusual resource open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/03/11/fascinating-bushwhacking-hike-at-pa-state-game-land-51-dunbar/&#34;&gt;Example from March 2012 of the kind of hike that Abby and I have enjoyed doing.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rachel Carson Trail will always have a special place in my heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Donna for keeping us company for most of the hike as trail sweep, and her husband for driving us to the start!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My Rachel Carson Trail hike for the year (13.4 miles): and how this is about love and gratitude</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/05/12/my-rachel-carson-trail-hike-for-the-year/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 May 2013 22:24:40 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/05/12/my-rachel-carson-trail-hike-for-the-year/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I did my first hike of the year (normally I would have done hiking already in the spring, but the combination of Abby&amp;rsquo;s broken foot and my Pittsburgh Marathon training this year resulted in no space for hiking until after the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/05/06/2013-pittsburgh-marathon-my-135th-race-was-my-worst-i-finished/&#34;&gt;marathon, which I did seven days ago&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first hike of the year just happened to turn out to be a grueling Rachel Carson Trail hike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, I reported on the two Rachel Carson Trail Challenge goal training hikes I did in &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/04/29/a-pretty-rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-hike/&#34;&gt;late April&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/06/03/a-totally-exhausting-rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-hike/&#34;&gt;early June&lt;/a&gt;. This year, I did the fourth of eight of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge/rctc13/goaltraining&#34;&gt;year&amp;rsquo;s goal training hikes&lt;/a&gt; offered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sunday, May 12&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leader: Donna Stolz 412-303-6102, Eileen Lessman 412-760-8863&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;13.4 miles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elevation change: 5055 ft&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This hike begins in North Park and heads over to Emmerling Park, then up and over Rich Hill and Lefever Hill. We end at the Log Cabin Road checkpoint location. Meet at Log Cabin Road parking area. Take Route 28 to Exit #12. Turn right at the end of the ramp, then right at the stop sign onto Little Deer Creek Road (aka Russellton Road). Travel about 1.5 miles and turn right on Log Cabin Road. Park about 100 yards ahead on the right.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of this year, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to do &lt;em&gt;only one&lt;/em&gt; Rachel Carson Trail hike a year, so this was it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my report on the hike, as well as my long-awaited explanation of why this trail means so much to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;weather&#34;&gt;Weather&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conditions were good. It was kind of chilly and windy, probably 45-50 degrees throughout the hike. The sun came and went. There were only short periods of light drizzling rain, thankfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;footwear&#34;&gt;Footwear&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek shoes I wore last year on the Rachel Carson Trail developed holes, as a result of which I &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/08/28/five-reasons-we-just-stocked-up-on-vibram-fivefingers-kso-trek-shoes/&#34;&gt;stocked up on some new ones&lt;/a&gt;. The pair that I opened, I&amp;rsquo;ve worn only a couple of times, and I wore this pair today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;comparison-with-last-year-s-hike&#34;&gt;Comparison with last year&amp;rsquo;s hike&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/06/03/a-totally-exhausting-rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-hike/&#34;&gt;Last year on the 18.1 mile hike&lt;/a&gt;, I was stupid about my smartphone, and this year I was smarter. Today&amp;rsquo;s hike was a shorter 13.4, so I was sure the battery would last long enough, if I didn&amp;rsquo;t take photos with flash. And of course, I always have a phone charge in my car now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year&amp;rsquo;s hike went east to west and ended in North Park. This year&amp;rsquo;s hike went west to east and started in North Park. But being shorter, it did not end in Springdale. It is really a different hike when you go on the same trail but in a different direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might enjoy comparing the photos in different directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;meeting-up-at-log-cabin-road&#34;&gt;Meeting up at Log Cabin Road&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John and I arrived on time but not early, which meant that when we arrived, we saw a whole contingent of people already carpooling to head to North Park. We never saw those people again. Oops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, although we were ready to go with the hike leader, Donna, latecomers kept on showing up, and we were lenient and waited for them, before all the rest of us remaining headed to North Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waiting for latecomers:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.03.20.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Because of Route 910 closures, some detours were necessary as Donna&amp;rsquo;s husband drove us to North Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hike&#34;&gt;Hike&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In North Park about to begin:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.45.23.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.45.26.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;By the time we started, there were only a handful of us together as a group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was momentarily confused because I saw someone running in the &lt;em&gt;wrong direction&lt;/em&gt; on the trail and thought she might be one of us, and was worried. I tried to follow her to call out to her, but she disappeared quickly:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.45.34.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Donna called out to me, and I rejoined the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In North Park, a few sections of the trail are on the road, but then we go into the woods for real:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.51.43.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.51.49.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.52.15.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a whole bunch of stream crossings while in North Park. Some of them are easier than others. I should note that one of the harder ones had some fast water and basically ensured that your feet would get wet, because the logs were floating and not completely safe to step on. Some people jumped, but that&amp;rsquo;s not safe. Wearing KSO Trek shoes, since the temperature was around 50, I was fine just getting my feet wet by walking through the water.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.05.16.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.05.22.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.10.50.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.10.56.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Out of the woods onto the railroad tracks (note that hiking in the reverse direction is tricky because it&amp;rsquo;s not well-marked where to get off the railroad tracks into the woods; John and I got lost the last time we did the reverse hike and had to backtrack!).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.18.50.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a good amount of road walking on this section of the Rachel Carson Trail.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.27.01.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.27.14.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.29.46.jpg&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Crossing Route 8:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.03.01.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally, the power lines:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.04.28.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I am a bit sentimental about this section of trail in Hampton Park because Abby and I have done some cross country skiing here in winter, when she used to live up here before we got married and she moved to Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.29.52.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Abby and I have also hung out here in the past watching birds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.37.55.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.41.13.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.48.38.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.49.37.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.54.37.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here is where John and I got lost. I was distracted by this sight and made a turn toward it (the trail turned in the opposite direction) to check it out:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.55.25.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;OK, &amp;ldquo;acidic condensate collection tank&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.56.02.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Hmm, this didn&amp;rsquo;t look familiar.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.57.12.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_11.05.31.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;John and I turned back. We lost about ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_11.06.42.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_11.07.38.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_11.15.12.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_11.18.16.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;No animals out and about today!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_11.41.38.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Funny how this happens to me once or twice each hike:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.01.43.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What the heck is this going on?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.07.33.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Uphill.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.07.53.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.11.35.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.19.47.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally at Emmerling Park, about 3 hours and 45 minutes into the hike.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.28.15.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I hung out at Emmerling Park for about ten or fifteen minutes, using the restroom and then playing on the swing relieving my aching feet while waiting for John and the others to catch up and also use the restroom. The truth is, I was ready to stop hiking already, feeling tired. I was also sore because of two falls I had sustained earlier in the hike. One of the falls involved my tripping on my right foot, causing me to land hard on my left, reinjuring my left knee that I had hurt before the marathon in a fall down the stairs. My left knee was causing me serious pain again now in the hike. I also fell on a steep downhill earlier, landing directly on my butt and on the palm of my left hand, which reinjured my left elbow. Finally, my right Achilles was killing me, because I had not adjusted the strap of my shoe properly; I had readjusted it during the hike, but the damage was already done. I was quite ready to stop hiking, but there were still two hours to go! Oops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Red flower:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.49.45.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.49.54.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And now we got to sections of the trail that are abused by ATVs and rutted and muddy. (We ended up encountering someone on an ATV, in fact.)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_13.02.18.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Standing water:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_13.05.17.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_13.14.42.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_13.22.04.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_13.24.59.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No fun at all hiking through these muddy ruts:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_13.28.24.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally back into open space:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_13.29.43.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Looking back down the big hill:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_13.33.09.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s John and the rest down at the bottom:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_13.34.50.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We keep on going up:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_13.34.55.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally at the top, looking back:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_13.39.36.jpg&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_13.51.14.jpg&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s going on here?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_14.05.03.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_14.05.28.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_14.09.45.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_14.15.19.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_14.21.07.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally back to the parking lot!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_14.25.11.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;after&#34;&gt;After&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hiked something like 5 hours and 45 minutes. It felt really long to us, as our first hike of the year. My feet were killing me. I was happy to take my shoes off and drive us back home barefoot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, my phone still barely had battery power left when we finished. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure it would have lasted another hour. This is useful to know. Of course, I immediately plugged it into my car charger! I should get an extra battery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-hike-this-trail-at-all&#34;&gt;Why hike this trail at all?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby is confused why I like occasionally (once or twice a year) hiking on the Rachel Carson Trail, even though much of the time I find it tiring and weird. I&amp;rsquo;ve never fully explained this in words, so here, finally, is my explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have many sentimental reasons to hike this trail. One is that eight years ago, in late May of 2005, when a local running friend said he was doing the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge/rctc05&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Trail Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, I had taken an entire half year off from running was feeling sad and lonely. I looked up the Challenge online, and happened to find that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge/rctc05/training&#34;&gt;training hikes led by Barb Peterson&lt;/a&gt; were being offered in just a few days, and although I had no intention whatsoever to do the Challenge, I thought the training hikes would be a fun way to do and see something different. After doing the third of four, I was so excited by the novelty that I ended up signing up for the Challenge!! With only three weeks left, there was not much training I could do for it, but I figured that if I just took it slowly, I should be able to finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2005 Challenge was an ordeal for me to finish, but I did, and the side effect was that I fell in love with hiking in general. I met people through doing the Challenge, and in 2006 I roped John into joining me on some longer training hikes, where we met more people, and some of them I began hiking with outside the context of the Challenge, in places like the Laurel Highlands. This was before the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/pittsburghhikers/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Hiking Meetup&lt;/a&gt; was formed in May 2007 and made it much easier to find people to hike with. So the 2005 Challenge had the side effect of getting me into making hiking a regular part of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, as I was training for the 2007 Challenge, that was the time when I had just met Abby and was dancing with her, but we were not dating yet. When we were chatting at a salsa dance, I learned that she liked to hike and was intrigued. I invited her to join me and John for an April 29 Rachel Carson Trail Challenge training hike that happened to be passing through Hampton (as today&amp;rsquo;s hike did), and she said she would join us for part of it. A comic series of events then took place, in which John and I arrived at Hampton earlier than she had expected, so she had not yet made it to Hampton to meet up with us. When I paused to call her, and she said she would meet us in the trail, John and I got confused and lost because of miscommunication. I kept having to call her again and again until we finally found her, and she set us straight back onto the trail and hiked with us for a bit before turning back. That was my first interaction with Abby outside of dancing; I got to see how she gracefully handled my clumsy mistakes during this outing and how helpful she was. It was a month after that when we finally started dating. Eventually, I proposed right after a hike led by one of the guys I originally first met through a Rachel Carson Trail Challenge training hike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I associate the Rachel Carson Trail not only with falling in love with hiking, and with meeting lots of interesting people I still hike with all these years later, but also I am reminded of how I fell in love with Abby and how hiking is a big part of what we have done and do. It is slightly ironic, of course, that she does not enjoy doing most sections of the Rachel Carson Trail, so in recent years I have been hiking it either alone or with John. And that is why I try to limit how often I hike on the trail; I&amp;rsquo;ve decided now to do it only once a year, so that I spend less time on hiking that Abby doesn&amp;rsquo;t do with me, in order to share more hiking with her. But I would like to spend good time on the trail once a year from now on to remember what it means to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, despite the strange hybrid nature of the trail, I believe in its existence and maintenance. It is a reminder that even in urban/suburban environments, there is still an underlying primitive nature that we can enjoy. The volunteers of the Rachel Carson Trails Conservancy work hard to keep this unusual resource open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/03/11/fascinating-bushwhacking-hike-at-pa-state-game-land-51-dunbar/&#34;&gt;Example from March 2012 of the kind of hike that Abby and I have enjoyed doing.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rachel Carson Trail will always have a special place in my heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Donna for keeping us company for most of the hike as trail sweep, and her husband for driving us to the start!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A totally exhausting Rachel Carson Trail Challenge goal training hike (18.1 miles</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/06/03/a-totally-exhausting-rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-hike/</link>

      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/06/03/a-totally-exhausting-rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-hike/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In April, I reported on a nice &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/04/29/a-pretty-rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-hike/&#34;&gt;8.9 mile hike on the Rachel Carson Trail&lt;/a&gt; I did with John, the second of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge/rctc12/goaltraining&#34;&gt;eight goal training hikes for the Rachel Carson Trail Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. I looked forward to doing a really long hike on the Rachel Carson Trail with John as my last hike on this trail for the year, and today was the one opportunity I had (during a very busy spring and summer weekend schedule) to get it in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The description of today&amp;rsquo;s hike, the seventh of eight:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sunday, June 3, 2012&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leader: Craig Fowler 412-491-6643&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;18.1 miles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elevation change: 6915 ft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;On this hike we&amp;rsquo;ll cover the second half of this year&amp;rsquo;s Challenge course. Starting in Springdale near the Springdale Veterans Association Hall, we&amp;rsquo;ll hike through Springdale then hit Log Cabin hill, Lefever Hill, and Rich Hill. Then we&amp;rsquo;ll stick the landing in North Park. Meet at the Harmar Shelter in North Park. Directions: Take I279 north to the McKnight Road exit and travel 6.4 miles north. Take the North Park/Ingomar Rd. exit east and turn right at the third traffic light onto Babcock Blvd., then take the next left onto Hemlock Drive, then left again into the swimming pool lot. Follow the perimeter drive all the way back and bear right. The Harmar Shelter is ahead on the left, behind the guardrail.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that a lot of things went wrong during this hike, but we survived!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;volunteering&#34;&gt;Volunteering&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the season, there had been a call for volunteers to lead or assist in the goal training hikes. I felt like giving back to the Rachel Carson Trail community, but didn&amp;rsquo;t feel ready yet to actually lead a hike. Instead, I accepted the role of helping (with John) by assisting in one of the longer ones, serving as trail sweeps in the back, aiding Miranda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;footwear&#34;&gt;Footwear&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to do a very long hike as a test of whether my feet could hold up in Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek shoes, on tough terrain as well as a very long distance. I always had problems (toe jamming, blistering, knee and ankle pain) wearing trail running shoes in the past hiking the Rachel Carson Trail in previous years when going about 20 miles or longer. In April&amp;rsquo;s Rachel Carson Trail hike, my feet got sore but otherwise I felt great. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how things would scale up to a much longer distance. So this was an opportunity to test my limits in FiveFingers shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;camera&#34;&gt;Camera&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/03/22/paradox-i-will-observe-the-national-day-of-unplugging-but-just-bought-my-first-smartphone-this-week/&#34;&gt;I have a smartphone, finally&lt;/a&gt;, I no longer have to lug around the bulky digital camera that I&amp;rsquo;ve had to use for the past couple of years for taking photos. So I decided to bring just the phone for this hike. On the April hike, my new phone&amp;rsquo;s camera had been dead for days (I ended up getting a replacement phone, whew!), so I had used John&amp;rsquo;s camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;meeting-up-at-north-park&#34;&gt;Meeting up at North Park&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John and I had a weird carpooling arrangement to get to North Park. Only John and I were hiking, but Abby needed to be up in the vicinity to visit her parents and pick up her car that they had, so we all went together. Abby dropped us off, the idea being that her parents were going to stop by North Park later in the morning to give her car back so that she could drive back home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parked at Harmar Shelter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;hike&#34;&gt;Hike&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took quite a while to ride back in a carpool to Springdale for the start. That just made us think of how long it would take to hike back to North Park!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I am, ready to start hiking:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_08.52.05.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Denser and higher greenery in June than a month ago:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_09.00.53.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Years ago, when I did the Rachel Carson Trail Challenge, the trail in Springdale went through a section of land called the &amp;ldquo;roller coaster&amp;rdquo;. Sadly, in recent years, because of problems landowners had with misbehaving hikers, they revoked the permission they had given for so long to go through their land. This force some rerouting of the trail through the streets of Springdale. Ironically, the rerouting resulted in the trail finally actually passing by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://rachel_carson_homestead.myupsite.com/&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Homestead&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some dirt road hiking:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_09.22.15.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A critter!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_09.26.37.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Butterfly:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_09.32.10.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Inevitable road walking, part of the whole Rachel Carson Trail experience:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_10.14.12.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Up:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_10.20.34.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Nice view into the distance:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_10.23.54.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now descending toward the road:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_10.35.29.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Looking back toward John:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_10.37.49.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the woods:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_10.45.23.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the &amp;ldquo;Rachel Carson Trail&amp;rdquo; signs, yellow on brown:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_10.52.30.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Back to road:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_11.08.39.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Dirt road:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_11.17.59.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Big descent coming up; you can see how there will be a valley:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_11.19.29.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_11.23.27.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The thing to remember is that after getting to the bottom, the trail does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; go back up. It actually makes a left.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_11.23.33.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the woods again:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_11.43.49.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_11.58.15.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Stream crossing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_12.30.28.jpg&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very convenient that the trail passes through Emmerling Park, because you can get water from the fountain and use the restrooms here before going on.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_12.39.41.jpg&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;An unpleasant section of high-speed road with no sidewalk:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_13.15.13.jpg&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Looking like it might rain:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_15.14.01.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_15.18.08.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;oops&#34;&gt;Oops&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, at this point, six and a half hours into a very long hike, my phone&amp;rsquo;s battery ran out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a problem because John and I had gotten separated from anyone else for some time already, and I worried about not being able to communicate with the hike leaders, whose responsibility it was to make sure everyone was accounted for at the end of the hike. Craig had my phone number, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t call him and he couldn&amp;rsquo;t call me. Nor could I call Abby to let her know when John and I were done and heading home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;finishing-the-hike&#34;&gt;Finishing the hike&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made it to North Park, but then &lt;em&gt;got lost&lt;/em&gt; in the trails. I had route maps on my phone, but my phone was dead. &lt;em&gt;Luckily&lt;/em&gt;, I had brought some paper printouts of some road maps of North Park (but no trail maps!!). As long as we got out of the woods and onto the roads, I was sure we would find the shelter and my car and be OK. At worst, there would be people around in North Park we could ask for more detailed directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it began to rain. Really hard. My paper maps were getting blurry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We eventually got to a road, and asked random people where the Harmar Shelter was, but they didn&amp;rsquo;t know. After some wandering around, we finally figured out where we were on the printed maps I had (the rain had stopped), and backtracked toward the shelter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then all of a sudden, John pointed at a car and said, &amp;ldquo;That car looks a lot like yours!&amp;rdquo; I replied that a lot of cars looked like mine, and ignored him. But then he noticed some distinguishing features and said it looked like it actually was mine. We were lucky, because it turned out the car was mine!! (Later I would learn from Abby that she had moved the car from where it had been parked in front of the shelter, to some random place further away, and texted me about the move, but of course, since I had not been checking my phone during the hike, and it died, I had no idea.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we made a note of where the car was before heading to the shelter. We saw no trace of Craig or Miranda. Oh great. Since Abby had moved the car, Craig must have left without waiting for us to return because he saw our car gone and assumed we had returned faster and had already gone home! (Later it would turn out that he had texted me as well as left voice mail asking me where I was and then after not getting a reply said he was leaving because he assumed we had finished.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shelter had a big, noisy party going on. We asked some random drunk guy if we could borrow his cell phone to make a call. He was kind enough to lend us the phone, and I called Craig (I was so fortunate that I had written in pen Craig&amp;rsquo;s number on one of the pieces of paper I had on me during the hike), and cleared up the confusion over whether we had finished or gone home. Then I called Abby and let her know John and I were OK, and drove us home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;after&#34;&gt;After&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was very happy to have made it home, and ate a ton of food. I noticed that my toes were numb, from all the hiking and the cold of stream crossing and rain. Also, my ankles were very stiff. The soles of my feet were quite sore. But I had no other leg soreness. So the experiment with footwear partially succeeded. (The numb toes were OK again after a couple of hours.) But still, I cannot imagine hiking more than 20 miles comfortably with the Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek. My feet were simply very sore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-learned&#34;&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned many lessons during this exhausting hike:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trail sweep can be a lonely, arduous task. I&amp;rsquo;m used to hiking with a pack of people, or at least having a pack in sight. Not being the fastest hikers on this hike, being the sweep meant actually being left behind!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am immediately buying a phone charger for my car. It would have saved a lot of trouble if I had been able to charge my phone upon reaching it, in order to access missed text messages and voice mail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; going to completely rely on the phone again for directions or maps. I will always have backup paper printouts of all important information, and in fact, put them in plastic bags in case of rain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will turn off automatic flash in order to save the phone battery when taking photos. Also, turn off unnecessary apps, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The FiveFingers shoes didn&amp;rsquo;t work too badly, but for a truly long distance are not cushioned enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the final hours, John and I simply were no longer enjoying the hike, but just wanted to finish. We don&amp;rsquo;t really want to do a hike this long or grueling again. We did about 20 miles today (extra distance beyond 18.1 because of getting lost in various places). &lt;em&gt;Never again&lt;/em&gt; do I want to hike this long on the Rachel Carson Trail. In 2005, 2006, and 2007, I did the full 34-mile Challenge just to prove I could, not because I actually enjoyed it as such. I don&amp;rsquo;t need to kill myself any more. I enjoy doing long, varied, meditative hikes, but there is a limit to how much I actually enjoy. 8 or 9 miles, as in the hike a month ago, is probably optimal for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew that this Rachel Carson Trail hike was going to be tough, but it got a lot tougher than I expected. I learned a lot as a result of the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Craig for checking up on us and leading the hike and Miranda for being with us on the sweep during the beginning, and thanks to Abby for taking us to the hike!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In April, I reported on a nice &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/04/29/a-pretty-rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-hike/&#34;&gt;8.9 mile hike on the Rachel Carson Trail&lt;/a&gt; I did with John, the second of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge/rctc12/goaltraining&#34;&gt;eight goal training hikes for the Rachel Carson Trail Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. I looked forward to doing a really long hike on the Rachel Carson Trail with John as my last hike on this trail for the year, and today was the one opportunity I had (during a very busy spring and summer weekend schedule) to get it in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The description of today&amp;rsquo;s hike, the seventh of eight:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sunday, June 3, 2012&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leader: Craig Fowler 412-491-6643&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;18.1 miles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elevation change: 6915 ft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;On this hike we&amp;rsquo;ll cover the second half of this year&amp;rsquo;s Challenge course. Starting in Springdale near the Springdale Veterans Association Hall, we&amp;rsquo;ll hike through Springdale then hit Log Cabin hill, Lefever Hill, and Rich Hill. Then we&amp;rsquo;ll stick the landing in North Park. Meet at the Harmar Shelter in North Park. Directions: Take I279 north to the McKnight Road exit and travel 6.4 miles north. Take the North Park/Ingomar Rd. exit east and turn right at the third traffic light onto Babcock Blvd., then take the next left onto Hemlock Drive, then left again into the swimming pool lot. Follow the perimeter drive all the way back and bear right. The Harmar Shelter is ahead on the left, behind the guardrail.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that a lot of things went wrong during this hike, but we survived!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;volunteering&#34;&gt;Volunteering&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the season, there had been a call for volunteers to lead or assist in the goal training hikes. I felt like giving back to the Rachel Carson Trail community, but didn&amp;rsquo;t feel ready yet to actually lead a hike. Instead, I accepted the role of helping (with John) by assisting in one of the longer ones, serving as trail sweeps in the back, aiding Miranda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;footwear&#34;&gt;Footwear&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to do a very long hike as a test of whether my feet could hold up in Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek shoes, on tough terrain as well as a very long distance. I always had problems (toe jamming, blistering, knee and ankle pain) wearing trail running shoes in the past hiking the Rachel Carson Trail in previous years when going about 20 miles or longer. In April&amp;rsquo;s Rachel Carson Trail hike, my feet got sore but otherwise I felt great. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how things would scale up to a much longer distance. So this was an opportunity to test my limits in FiveFingers shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;camera&#34;&gt;Camera&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/03/22/paradox-i-will-observe-the-national-day-of-unplugging-but-just-bought-my-first-smartphone-this-week/&#34;&gt;I have a smartphone, finally&lt;/a&gt;, I no longer have to lug around the bulky digital camera that I&amp;rsquo;ve had to use for the past couple of years for taking photos. So I decided to bring just the phone for this hike. On the April hike, my new phone&amp;rsquo;s camera had been dead for days (I ended up getting a replacement phone, whew!), so I had used John&amp;rsquo;s camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;meeting-up-at-north-park&#34;&gt;Meeting up at North Park&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John and I had a weird carpooling arrangement to get to North Park. Only John and I were hiking, but Abby needed to be up in the vicinity to visit her parents and pick up her car that they had, so we all went together. Abby dropped us off, the idea being that her parents were going to stop by North Park later in the morning to give her car back so that she could drive back home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parked at Harmar Shelter:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_08.11.20.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;hike&#34;&gt;Hike&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took quite a while to ride back in a carpool to Springdale for the start. That just made us think of how long it would take to hike back to North Park!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I am, ready to start hiking:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Denser and higher greenery in June than a month ago:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_09.00.53.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Years ago, when I did the Rachel Carson Trail Challenge, the trail in Springdale went through a section of land called the &amp;ldquo;roller coaster&amp;rdquo;. Sadly, in recent years, because of problems landowners had with misbehaving hikers, they revoked the permission they had given for so long to go through their land. This force some rerouting of the trail through the streets of Springdale. Ironically, the rerouting resulted in the trail finally actually passing by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://rachel_carson_homestead.myupsite.com/&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Homestead&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_09.15.03.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some dirt road hiking:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_09.22.15.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A critter!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_09.26.37.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Butterfly:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_09.32.10.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Inevitable road walking, part of the whole Rachel Carson Trail experience:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_10.14.12.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Up:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_10.20.34.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Nice view into the distance:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_10.23.54.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_10.32.43.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now descending toward the road:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_10.35.29.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Looking back toward John:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_10.37.49.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the woods:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_10.45.23.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the &amp;ldquo;Rachel Carson Trail&amp;rdquo; signs, yellow on brown:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_10.52.30.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Back to road:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_11.08.39.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Dirt road:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_11.17.59.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Big descent coming up; you can see how there will be a valley:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_11.19.29.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_11.23.27.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The thing to remember is that after getting to the bottom, the trail does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; go back up. It actually makes a left.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_11.23.33.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_11.26.37.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the woods again:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_11.43.49.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_11.58.15.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Stream crossing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_12.30.28.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_12.31.41.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very convenient that the trail passes through Emmerling Park, because you can get water from the fountain and use the restrooms here before going on.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_12.39.41.jpg&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;An unpleasant section of high-speed road with no sidewalk:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_13.15.13.jpg&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Looking like it might rain:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_15.14.01.jpg&#34; /&gt;

&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_15.18.08.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;oops&#34;&gt;Oops&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, at this point, six and a half hours into a very long hike, my phone&amp;rsquo;s battery ran out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a problem because John and I had gotten separated from anyone else for some time already, and I worried about not being able to communicate with the hike leaders, whose responsibility it was to make sure everyone was accounted for at the end of the hike. Craig had my phone number, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t call him and he couldn&amp;rsquo;t call me. Nor could I call Abby to let her know when John and I were done and heading home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;finishing-the-hike&#34;&gt;Finishing the hike&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made it to North Park, but then &lt;em&gt;got lost&lt;/em&gt; in the trails. I had route maps on my phone, but my phone was dead. &lt;em&gt;Luckily&lt;/em&gt;, I had brought some paper printouts of some road maps of North Park (but no trail maps!!). As long as we got out of the woods and onto the roads, I was sure we would find the shelter and my car and be OK. At worst, there would be people around in North Park we could ask for more detailed directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it began to rain. Really hard. My paper maps were getting blurry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We eventually got to a road, and asked random people where the Harmar Shelter was, but they didn&amp;rsquo;t know. After some wandering around, we finally figured out where we were on the printed maps I had (the rain had stopped), and backtracked toward the shelter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then all of a sudden, John pointed at a car and said, &amp;ldquo;That car looks a lot like yours!&amp;rdquo; I replied that a lot of cars looked like mine, and ignored him. But then he noticed some distinguishing features and said it looked like it actually was mine. We were lucky, because it turned out the car was mine!! (Later I would learn from Abby that she had moved the car from where it had been parked in front of the shelter, to some random place further away, and texted me about the move, but of course, since I had not been checking my phone during the hike, and it died, I had no idea.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we made a note of where the car was before heading to the shelter. We saw no trace of Craig or Miranda. Oh great. Since Abby had moved the car, Craig must have left without waiting for us to return because he saw our car gone and assumed we had returned faster and had already gone home! (Later it would turn out that he had texted me as well as left voice mail asking me where I was and then after not getting a reply said he was leaving because he assumed we had finished.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shelter had a big, noisy party going on. We asked some random drunk guy if we could borrow his cell phone to make a call. He was kind enough to lend us the phone, and I called Craig (I was so fortunate that I had written in pen Craig&amp;rsquo;s number on one of the pieces of paper I had on me during the hike), and cleared up the confusion over whether we had finished or gone home. Then I called Abby and let her know John and I were OK, and drove us home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;after&#34;&gt;After&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was very happy to have made it home, and ate a ton of food. I noticed that my toes were numb, from all the hiking and the cold of stream crossing and rain. Also, my ankles were very stiff. The soles of my feet were quite sore. But I had no other leg soreness. So the experiment with footwear partially succeeded. (The numb toes were OK again after a couple of hours.) But still, I cannot imagine hiking more than 20 miles comfortably with the Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek. My feet were simply very sore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-learned&#34;&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned many lessons during this exhausting hike:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trail sweep can be a lonely, arduous task. I&amp;rsquo;m used to hiking with a pack of people, or at least having a pack in sight. Not being the fastest hikers on this hike, being the sweep meant actually being left behind!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am immediately buying a phone charger for my car. It would have saved a lot of trouble if I had been able to charge my phone upon reaching it, in order to access missed text messages and voice mail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; going to completely rely on the phone again for directions or maps. I will always have backup paper printouts of all important information, and in fact, put them in plastic bags in case of rain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will turn off automatic flash in order to save the phone battery when taking photos. Also, turn off unnecessary apps, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The FiveFingers shoes didn&amp;rsquo;t work too badly, but for a truly long distance are not cushioned enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the final hours, John and I simply were no longer enjoying the hike, but just wanted to finish. We don&amp;rsquo;t really want to do a hike this long or grueling again. We did about 20 miles today (extra distance beyond 18.1 because of getting lost in various places). &lt;em&gt;Never again&lt;/em&gt; do I want to hike this long on the Rachel Carson Trail. In 2005, 2006, and 2007, I did the full 34-mile Challenge just to prove I could, not because I actually enjoyed it as such. I don&amp;rsquo;t need to kill myself any more. I enjoy doing long, varied, meditative hikes, but there is a limit to how much I actually enjoy. 8 or 9 miles, as in the hike a month ago, is probably optimal for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew that this Rachel Carson Trail hike was going to be tough, but it got a lot tougher than I expected. I learned a lot as a result of the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Craig for checking up on us and leading the hike and Miranda for being with us on the sweep during the beginning, and thanks to Abby for taking us to the hike!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
