      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was my second official celebration (with a day off from work as
a holiday) of
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr._Day&#34;&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr. Day&lt;/a&gt;. (I
wrote last year on
&lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2015/01/19/for-martin-luther-king-jr-day-some-black-american-voices-that-spoke-to-me-recently/&#34;&gt;my first official celebration&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For today, I not only reread MLK&amp;rsquo;s 1963
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Letter from a Birmingham jail&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;
as I do annually, but also rewatched my single favorite X-Files
episode,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musings_of_a_Cigarette_Smoking_Man&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;
from 1997.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite unexpectedly, this hilariously entertaining yet dark and sad
episode of the TV series made a deep impression on my mind when I saw
it almost twenty years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;mlk-in-the-x-files-episode-warning-spoilers&#34;&gt;MLK in the X-files episode (warning: spoilers!!)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t watched this old 1997 episode of the X-files before
you might want to go and watch it before reading any further. If you
already have watched it or don&amp;rsquo;t care, here&amp;rsquo;s an unofficial
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.insidethex.co.uk/transcrp/scrp407.htm&#34;&gt;transcript&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, this episode is a Forrest Gump inspired look back at
history, in which the infamous
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smoking_Man&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;smoking man&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;
character is revealed (or is he?) to have had a history involving
having a father who was an executed communist spy, but he himself
grows up into a young man devoted to working covertly to defeat
perceived threats to America. According to the story as it unfolds in
this episode, the smoking man personally assassinated both John
F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What made the part about assassinating MLK poignant was that he
respected MLK, and decided to eliminate him because of a speech by MLK
he heard on his radio against the Vietnam War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The smoking man says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If this were only a civil rights issue, I&amp;rsquo;d vote for a King/Benjamin
Spock presidential ticket. But after last night, it&amp;rsquo;s not&amp;hellip;  I
respect King. He&amp;rsquo;s an extraordinary man. But now he&amp;rsquo;s talking like a
Maoist&amp;hellip; And if he convinces Negroes not to fight in Vietnam, we&amp;rsquo;ll
lose&amp;hellip; and the first domino will have fallen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;mlk-s-1967-speech-beyond-vietnam-a-time-to-break-silence-https-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-beyond-vietnam-a-time-to-break-silence&#34;&gt;MLK&amp;rsquo;s 1967 speech, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_Vietnam:_A_Time_to_Break_Silence&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkatimetobreaksilence.htm&#34;&gt;transcript&lt;/a&gt;
of the actual speech that so angered and saddened the X-Files smoking
man (and in real history, a whole lot of people).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An excerpt used in the X-Files episode: &amp;ldquo;It is a sad fact that because
of comfort, complacency, a morbid fear of communism, our proneness to
adjust to injustice, the Western nations that initiated so much of the
revolutionary spirit of the modern world have now become the arch
anti-revolutionaries. This has driven many to feel that only Marxism
has a revolutionary spirit. Therefore, communism is a judgment against
our failure to make democracy real and follow through on the
revolutions that we initiated. Our only hope today lies in our ability
to recapture the revolutionary spirit and go out into a sometimes
hostile world declaring eternal hostility to poverty, racism, and
militarism.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s audio of MLK himself speaking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zyE4eo_leX8&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-the-us-and-world-were-like-in-1997&#34;&gt;What the US and world were like in 1997&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was watching this episode in 1997, I had been in a state of
apathy and disappointment in the legacy of MLK for a number of years,
partially thanks to having watched Spike Lee&amp;rsquo;s 1992 film
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_X_%281992_film%29&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Malcolm X&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;
and then gone on to read the 1965
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Autobiography_of_Malcolm_X&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. I
had come to get the impression that MLK had failed, because he was too
&amp;ldquo;soft&amp;rdquo;, and Malcolm X was &amp;ldquo;tougher&amp;rdquo;. Note that the 1990s was a dark
time, as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_King&#34;&gt;Rodney King&lt;/a&gt;
beating was in 1991 and the LA riots were in 1992. And the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnian_War&#34;&gt;Bosnian War&lt;/a&gt; 1992-1995 was
fresh in my memory, illustrating that the end of the Cold War in 1991
was just the beginning of a falling apart of the former Eastern Bloc.
So the 1990s were a time when I wondered what had gone wrong, not only
in America, but in the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow, revisiting MLK by accident through this X-Files episode, I
returned to thinking that I wished MLK had lived much longer. It felt
to me that he was only starting his global work when he was shut
down. Yet, as long as his words remain, and are not forgotten, there
may be hope. Not so much the overexposed 1963 words like
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Have_a_Dream&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have a dream&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, but
the 1967 words against the American war on Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why, when 2003 came around, with the beginning of the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War&#34;&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt;, I felt angry and
sad, and remembered that X-Files episode. I knew that MLK would have
warned against the Iraq War as well. Was there any way he could have
stopped it? Or would he have been eliminated, again?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year, I will continue to renew my memory of and my understanding
of what MLK did in his life and what he was in the middle of doing
when he was murdered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>For Martin Luther King, Jr. Day: some black American voices that spoke to me recently</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2015/01/19/for-martin-luther-king-jr-day-some-black-american-voices-that-spoke-to-me-recently/</link>

      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2015/01/19/for-martin-luther-king-jr-day-some-black-american-voices-that-spoke-to-me-recently/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I believe today was the first time in my life I&amp;rsquo;ve officially celebrated &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr._Day&#34;&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr. Day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means many things to me as an American (I am an Asian-American, son of immigrants).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;mlk-day-became-an-official-holiday-at-work-finally&#34;&gt;MLK Day became an official holiday at work, finally&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, I didn&amp;rsquo;t go to work today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, 2015, was the year that MLK Day finally became an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cmu.edu/leadership/president-suresh/presidential-communications/2014/2014-08-21.html&#34;&gt;official university holiday at Carnegie Mellon University&lt;/a&gt;! Our new president, Subra Suresh, decided to finally end the weird CMU tradition of observing MLK Day only as a half-day holiday for students, and turning it into a full-day holiday for everyone (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cmu.edu/cipi/news-events/2014/140114_Frazer-2014-MLK-Keynote-Address.html&#34;&gt;2014&amp;rsquo;s schedule of events&lt;/a&gt; for an example of how things used to be). I am proud of President Suresh for taking the step of turning MLK Day into a full holiday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-recent-black-american-voices-i-heard&#34;&gt;Some recent black American voices I heard&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The media frenzy over the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Michael_Brown&#34;&gt;shooting last year in Ferguson&lt;/a&gt; may have ended, but I have not forgotten &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2014/11/27/report-on-my-fourth-day-of-stoic-week-2014/&#34;&gt;my vow last year to begin engaging more publicly in discussions about race in America&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m starting off small, by linking to eloquent, heartfelt writings I&amp;rsquo;ve read and saved in the past year (independent of Ferguson, just part of what comes my way online) by black Americans who shared their various life experiences so that those of us who are not black can better understand what they have dealt with in their lives in the US. I&amp;rsquo;ve deliberately chosen articles by high achievers to highlight what still remains even after doing all the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; things to try to live as normally as possible as a black American.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-price-of-black-ambition-http-www-vqronline-org-essays-articles-2014-10-price-black-ambition&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vqronline.org/essays-articles/2014/10/price-black-ambition&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The price of black ambition&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an essay by a black female writer, Roxane Gay, daughter of Haitian immigrants, whose life was marked by great ambition and hard work. She kept hoping that it would be enough to overcome racism. She writes, &amp;ldquo;I have come to realize how much I have, throughout my life, bought into the narrative of this alluring myth of personal responsibility and excellence.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-other-side-of-diversity-http-medium-com-ericajoy-the-other-side-of-diversity-1bb3de2f053e&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://medium.com/@ericajoy/the-other-side-of-diversity-1bb3de2f053e&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The other side of diversity&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This poignant essay by a black woman discusses what it has been like to work in a predominantly white male tech community, thereby facing the dilemmas of minority status in two dimensions (race, gender). She has found it challenging to simply be who she wants to be, &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;a black woman who happens to work in the tech industry&amp;rdquo;, rather than something additional seemingly expected of her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-taught-my-black-kids-that-their-elite-upbringing-would-protect-them-from-discrimination-i-was-wrong-http-www-washingtonpost-com-posteverything-wp-2014-11-06-i-taught-my-black-kids-that-their-elite-upbringing-would-protect-them-from-discrimination-i-was-wrong&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/11/06/i-taught-my-black-kids-that-their-elite-upbringing-would-protect-them-from-discrimination-i-was-wrong/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;I taught my black kids that their elite upbringing would protect them from discrimination. I was wrong.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article by Lawrence Otis Graham talks about how he and his wife tried to shelter their children from racial discrimination by giving them an upper-middle-class upbringing. &amp;ldquo;My wife and I, both African Americans, constitute one of those Type A couples with Ivy League undergraduate and graduate degrees who, for many years, believed that if we worked hard and maintained great jobs, we could insulate our children from the blatant manifestations of bigotry that we experienced as children in the 1960s and ’70s.&amp;rdquo; Especially check out the detailed &amp;ldquo;rules&amp;rdquo; of behavior that they taught their children in hope that they would not be mistakenly targeted through racial profiling!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;mlk-s-letter-from-a-birmingham-jail-http-www-africa-upenn-edu-articles-gen-letter-birmingham-html&#34;&gt;MLK&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Letter from a Birmingham jail&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I want to simply quote MLK himself from his brilliant essay, &amp;ldquo;Letter from a Birmingham jail&amp;rdquo;. The key to his work, often forgotten or deliberately obscured, is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro&#39;s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen&#39;s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to &#34;order&#34; than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: &#34;I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action&#34;; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man&#39;s freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a &#34;more convenient season.&#34; Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political &amp;ldquo;moderation&amp;rdquo; is often praised and held up as superior to &amp;ldquo;extremism&amp;rdquo;, but in fact, the &amp;ldquo;moderate&amp;rdquo; is often a large part of the problem when it comes to change and doing the right thing. I have more to say about this general topic, but not right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, read the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html&#34;&gt;whole letter&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most brilliant examples of the art and science of that rhetoric I have ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I observed MLK Day today by reviewing writings by black Americans and rereading MLK&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Letter from a Birmingham jail&amp;rdquo;. In the US, we still have a long way to go in race relations, but we continue to make progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you observe MLK Day today? What is on your mind today? Did you participate in a reading or a march? Do you oppose what MLK did and believe there should be no holiday in his honor? Or do you feel he didn&amp;rsquo;t do enough, that nonviolence didn&amp;rsquo;t work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
