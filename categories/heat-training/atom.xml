&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s less than one month less before the Pittsburgh Marathon, yet I have done no interval training for it until today. In ordinary circumstances, I would have been doing weekly interval training for some time now, but I had a late start with training in the winter, and so I simply have not felt ready for hard interval training until this week! Up till now, I have simply been scrambling to increase mileage and survive the long runs without injury and burnout, and this has been challenging enough: last week, I was fortunate to &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/04/06/comeback-from-pittsburgh-marathon-overtraining/&#34;&gt;bounce back from clear overtraining&lt;/a&gt;. But now I&amp;rsquo;m actually starting to feel strong, so it&amp;rsquo;s time to sharpen up with interval training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-interval-training&#34;&gt;Why interval training?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_training&#34;&gt;Interval training&lt;/a&gt; is well-known from research to be extremely beneficial for improving performance at distance running. It builds the body as well as the mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-workout&#34;&gt;My workout&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decade ago, I used to do interval training on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://athletics.cmu.edu/facilities/gesling&#34;&gt;CMU track of Gesling Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, but I never really liked running around a synthetic track. There are other options, of course. I have good memories of running around the 1K dirt track (not the synthetic 400m track) at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pittsburghparks.org/schenley-sports&#34;&gt;oval in Schenley Park&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But nowadays, I find that the most convenient place for interval training is a trail loop near home in Frick Park that just happens to be very close to 800m in length. The drawback, of course, is that the length of this loop means I can only do intervals of multiples of 800m. Unfortunately, I prefer doing 1200m long intervals, while I find 1600m to be on the brutal side for an interval workout. But 800m will do for my first interval workout of the year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up doing 6x800. Oh, and it turned out to be a heat training workout too, because it suddenly got very warm, like summer already. I really hope that it cools down quickly and stays cool for the Pittsburgh Marathon! I don&amp;rsquo;t want summer conditions to come until &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 15 minutes of easy running, I launched into the intervals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purely by subjective feel, I ended up running these intervals in an average of about 3:37 each, with 1:50 timed recovery:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3:38, 1:54&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3:40, 1:51&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3:37, 1:47&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3:34, 1:50&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3:35, 1:53&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3:39&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The numbers don&amp;rsquo;t mean much to me right now, except as a checkpoint for the future. The workout was pretty tough. I felt semi-pukey and exhausted by the end!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;footwear&#34;&gt;Footwear&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am now running only in Luna Sandals. I still have chafing issues, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see if they clear up with time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-about-high-intensity-interval-training&#34;&gt;What about high-intensity interval training?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training&#34;&gt;High-intensity interval training&lt;/a&gt; has become very popular in recent years, and for good reason. I was doing some on the treadmill in the winter in order to kickstart my running, but then put it aside when I left the treadmill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expect to start incorporating serious HIIT into my training to get even sharper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s good to finally be back to interval training, after basically some years of not being serious and strong and disciplined enough to do it systematically.&lt;/p&gt;
