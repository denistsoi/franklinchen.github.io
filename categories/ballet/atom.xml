      <title>Copland&#39;s Appalachian Spring danced by the orchestra musicians: confronting my memories of boredom four years ago</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I follow Greg Sandow&amp;rsquo;s blog on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.artsjournal.com/sandow/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;future of classical music&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. He posted an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.artsjournal.com/sandow/2014/05/essential-video.html&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; that got me thinking: he was all excited about an unorthodox performance of Aaron Copland&amp;rsquo;s half-hour-long &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Spring&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Appalachian Spring&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; by the University of Maryland Symphony Orchestra in which the students of the orchestra actually moved around and danced as well as played their instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a confession to make: back almost four years ago, in November 2010, I went to a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cmu.edu/news/archive/2010/November/nov15_cmunightwithpso.shtml&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Carnegie Mellon Night at the Symphony&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; in which &amp;ldquo;Appalachian Spring&amp;rdquo; was on the program. &lt;strong&gt;I got very bored during the piece.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to remember is that the orchestra suite was actually arranged by Copland from his original piece that was an actual ballet for Martha Graham! So it&amp;rsquo;s actually kind of unnatural to experience this music &amp;ldquo;purely&amp;rdquo; as music. To me the suite is rather long and redundant without some kind of &amp;ldquo;story&amp;rdquo; to go along with it. So I watched the video of the orchestra-danced performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was definitely more interesting seeing action. At the same time, I got bored eventually anyway, after about 15 minutes. But I lasted longer with the physical action. However, I was also distracted by thoughts of how difficult it must have been for the orchestra to pull this off. I mean, marching band is one thing, but this is an orchestra and there was a ton of choreography and it&amp;rsquo;s not just marching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s interesting that a commenter on Sandow&amp;rsquo;s blog criticized the
effort, writing: &lt;em&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s nicely done, I suppose, if you must do this
sort of thing. But when I go to an orchestral concert, I&amp;rsquo;m there for
the music, not for this sort of thing. To me, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t tell the
audience &amp;ldquo;this music is worth your time and attention,&amp;rdquo; it tells them
&amp;ldquo;we have so little faith that youâ€™ll enjoy the music that we feel
compelled to trick it out with distractions.&amp;rdquo; I used to sing in a
chorus that was fond of &amp;ldquo;chorusography,&amp;rdquo; and it annoyed me as a
performer, too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think? Do you like this idea or does it annoy you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judge for yourself:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>100th anniversary: remembering the first time I heard Stravinsky&#39;s &#34;The Rite of Spring&#34;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s been a crazy amount of media coverage about the 100th anniversary of the performance of Igor Stravinsky&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rite_of_Spring&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Rite of Spring&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; that caused riots (what great publicity then and even now). I&amp;rsquo;ve been bombarded with a lot of commentary. Some of it was interesting and insightful, but eventually I got tired of reading any further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to go back to the source, and listen to it again, and also actually &lt;em&gt;watch&lt;/em&gt; it for the first time ever!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-first-time&#34;&gt;My first time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I totally remember the first time I ever heard excerpts of &amp;ldquo;The Rite of Spring&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was in a music class in college in around 1989 or 1990.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was taking a two-semester music theory course sequence for non-majors. The instructor at one point played back for us excerpts of this music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was very startling music to me, very harsh and chaotic and confusing. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t say I hated it, but I certainly did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; enjoy it at all. I had a rather conservative musical taste in college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you know what, I was quite stimulated in that our instructor didn&amp;rsquo;t require us to love it, but just put it on, showed his enthusiasm, and &lt;em&gt;analyzed&lt;/em&gt; what was going on in some of the music, such as the changing irregular meters; the random accents; the bizarre orchestration; the deliberate violation of conventional harmonic voice leading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noticing some of the structural characteristics of the music didn&amp;rsquo;t always make them less harsh on my ear, but at least let me understand that this wasn&amp;rsquo;t just noise but was really thought out for a purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t voluntarily listen to this music again for another quarter of a century, but those excerpts still stuck in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;today-a-quarter-of-a-century-later&#34;&gt;Today, a quarter of a century later&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ballet&#34;&gt;Ballet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main thing I decided was to actually watch the music as intended for ballet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YouTube made this easy. Here&amp;rsquo;s the Joffrey Ballet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/ewOBXph0hP4&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will confess that watching the ballet made the music much more engaging, because of correlations with action, and especially the drawn out repetitive nature of the music get boring for me in the absence of &amp;ldquo;something&amp;rdquo; going on, a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was struck by how much I enjoy this music now. The textures Stravinsky creates are fresh and transparent, gorgeous even. The music emerges as though from the world itself. Many moods are portrayed, from the mysterious to the somber to the creepy to the deadly to the ecstatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s clearly not something I&amp;rsquo;d listen to every day, but I would happily revisit it now and then as I would a favorite film. This music lights my brain on fire!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;computer-animation&#34;&gt;Computer animation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing I did was check out a computer animation of the score by Stephen Malinowski, thanks to an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/2013/05/27/186461168/watch-a-mind-blowing-visualization-of-the-rite-of-spring&#34;&gt;NPR blog post I saw mentioning it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved it! Being able to see all the parts and how the voices flow with or against one another gave me a real thrill, an added dimension to just listening. You can see what is regular, what is irregular, what is sheer freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;selected-commentary&#34;&gt;Selected commentary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said I quickly got tired of reading commentary. Nevertheless, here are some interesting links:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/public/article1275660.ece&#34;&gt;Robert Craft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was interesting to revisit strange music after a quarter of a century to find that my musical enjoyment had changed considerably. When I was in college, I thought &amp;ldquo;The Rite of Spring&amp;rdquo; was weird; now, I think it is a work of amazing beauty, expression, and creative freedom. Wow. And that was a hundred years ago. How could music ever be the same again after that!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pittsburgh OvreArts concert &#34;Art songs and interludes&#34;</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/04/18/pittsburgh-ovrearts-concert-art-songs-and-interludes/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2013 23:30:35 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/04/18/pittsburgh-ovrearts-concert-art-songs-and-interludes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I heard about a free community concert by a local Pittsburgh music group called &lt;a href=&#34;http://ovrearts.org/&#34;&gt;OvreArts&lt;/a&gt; and decided to check it out, since it promised to perform new works. Abby came along. The program was called &amp;ldquo;Art songs and interludes&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a video prelude to the concert:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/zJOAig1fkDw&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And some words from the young composers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/5Fma5Lv0RWQ&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-concert&#34;&gt;The concert&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a confession to make. I&amp;rsquo;m not generally so interested in songs, as opposed to purely instrumental music. So I got fatigued by the program of one short work after another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, much of the music had a sacred setting. Outside of that, there were love songs of a largely gentle nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was unusual to me to encounter music that had an &amp;ldquo;old-fashioned&amp;rdquo; feel to it from such young composers, but this is apparently part of the united mission of the OvreArts group. I respect their philosophical and musical convictions, but I found the program for this particular concert to be too sedate and not stimulating enough for my taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-work&#34;&gt;Other work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair, I looked online to see more about previous work of OvreArts and it seems that I would have enjoyed attending a live performance of a ballet by composers of OvreArts, such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://ovrearts.org/infinity-a-ballet-in-15-tableau/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Infinity&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. I found this excerpt definitely stimulating:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/G-kpzKIZnmY&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will keep an eye out for new music by OvreArts composers, now that it&amp;rsquo;s on my radar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
