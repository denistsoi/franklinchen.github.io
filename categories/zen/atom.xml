      <title>Staring at the Wall With Nowhere to Go</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s 4:30 PM, and I scramble to finish up my work early for this day, and rush over to a little room across campus, where every Wednesday I embark on an adventure in which I don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly what I will find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may be six other people in the room. Or there may be fifteen. Or just three. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how many. In this room, our main mission is to line up facing the wall and sit down on &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zafu&#34;&gt;cushions&lt;/a&gt; on the floor and remain silent, and just see what the heck happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the world of Zen meditation, aka &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zazen&#34;&gt;zazen&lt;/a&gt;. Carnegie Mellon University is truly lucky to have an arrangement to offer free weekly meditation sessions on campus, held by &lt;a href=&#34;http://citydharma.wordpress.com/author/jisen3/&#34;&gt;Rev. Jisen Coghlan&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://deepspringzen.org/&#34;&gt;Zen Center of Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;. These meditation sessions, offered to all CMU students, faculty, and staff, began in January of 2011, after much positive response to her keynote address in June 2010 at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://events.web.cmu.edu/ecal/event/127446959876236137&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Pathways to Health&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; event offered at CMU to staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been attending this event since the second week it was offered (I missed the initial meeting because I had not heard about it in time). I have been very grateful for the opportunity to sit with others, since for a couple of years I had periodically meditated privately at home, but never with other people, and felt I missed something as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically we have a short orientation for those new to meditation (almost every week someone new joins us to try it out), and then we sit for 20-30 minutes, do walking meditation (aka &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinhin&#34;&gt;kinhin&lt;/a&gt;) for 10 minutes, then sit for another 20 minutes (prefaced by a short reading from a text), then have a brief open discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve had a good mix of students, staff, and faculty come to the sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to describe what happens, for me, when I meditate. First of all, physically, sitting meditation is physically tough for me (I find walking meditation much easier; others find the opposite). I&amp;rsquo;m perpetually trying to adopt a &amp;ldquo;relaxed&amp;rdquo; but upright posture. My legs get sore and used to fall asleep. I wonder whether my arms and hands are in the right place and relaxed. I may feel an itch on my face and wonder whether to scratch it. I may wonder whether my breathing is too loud and annoying my sitting neighbor. Etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The physical discomfort is nothing compared to the mental discomfort. I may feel anxious about things I need to do, or conflicts in my life. I may worry about whether other people are sitting better than me. I may have random thoughts about my childhood, or about the future. I may feel very sleepy and start nodding off and slumping on the cushion. We are instructed to observe our thoughts non-judgmentally and let them go. Therefore, the most annoying thought to come up during meditation is the thought that I&amp;rsquo;m not letting my annoying thoughts go! It&amp;rsquo;s a riddle. Yet, after a while, things usually do settle down a bit. A bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would never call meditation &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;relaxing&amp;rdquo;, although sometimes it is calming. Other times it is an ordeal and makes me frustrated or angry. In any case, I keep on going, week after week. I get the sense that it is beneficial for me. But mainly, it is a &lt;em&gt;practice&lt;/em&gt; for me. It is something I do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
