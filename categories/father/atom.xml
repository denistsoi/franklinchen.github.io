      <title>What unexpected life lessons have you learned from your father?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I came across a great story by a guy who wrote an article,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-32961309&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;How my father gave me a terrifying lesson at 10&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please read the whole thing before reading further below, where I&amp;rsquo;ll
share some stories about my own father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-misunderstood-lesson&#34;&gt;The misunderstood lesson&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Warning: this is a spoiler if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already read
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-32961309&#34;&gt;the story&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you guess what the lesson was going to be before reaching the
  end of the story? At what point did you get the idea that the author
  of the story did not grasp for twenty years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw it coming as soon as terrifying accidents started happening down
in the coal mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, the father was trying to terrify his son out of becoming a
coal miner like him. It was an act of manipulation but also of
compassion. And it worked, but not without his son bearing resentment
for the apparently mean and senseless prank for twenty years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-stories&#34;&gt;My stories&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was reminded of some less drastic manipulation that I faced in my
childhood that had unexpected benefits that I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand at the
time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the author, I was about ten years old when these incidents
occurred: old enough to feel embarrassment, shame, self-consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-cigar&#34;&gt;The cigar&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day my father came home from work with a box of cigars. I guess it
was some kind of present. Neither he nor my mother smoked at all, so I
was surprised that he lit one up and handed it to me to try out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this was around 1980, when I had lived ten years in the
1970s when I still saw a lot of smoking in old TV show and movies, and
I saw the Marlboro Man everywhere in print (he just
&lt;a href=&#34;http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/01/27/3207091/marlboro-man-dies-smoking/&#34;&gt;died last year from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease &lt;/a&gt;. Today&amp;rsquo;s
anti-smoking culture in America did not exist yet then. I knew lots of
people who smoked: my relatives, doctors, you name it. In fact, in the
blue-collar neighborhood where we lived, half the teachers smoked,
probably half my schoolmates smoked by the time they got to around age
12, our next door neighbors and their children all smoked. The local
chess club my father took me to, located in the basement of the
community center, was always filled with smoke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I had not yet reached an age when I might have started running
around with a smoking crowd and gotten into it myself. I had a little
bit of curiosity, but not much. Still, enough that I was excited that
my father was going to share something &amp;ldquo;grownup&amp;rdquo; with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had no idea what I was doing, took a puff, and coughed with total
disgust. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know at the time that there were proper ways to
handle a cigar; I guess it was a good thing I didn&amp;rsquo;t know that. All I
knew was that I was in agony, the special treat from my father was
bullshit, that I never wanted anything to do with a cigar, or by
extension a cigarette, again in my life. I was &lt;em&gt;angry&lt;/em&gt; that he did
this thing to me. We never talked about this incident again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And therefore, I have never smoked in my life. The memory of that
experience was just too painful, and also by middle school, I started
hearing preaching by some other adults (and some crusading classmates
as well) about the health dangers of smoking. I was so traumatized
that this information alone put me off permanently, overriding any
natural curiosity I had about how pleasurable smoking had to be that
people would take risks and pay money to engage in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-beer&#34;&gt;The beer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something similar happened with alcohol. One day my father had some
cans of beer around, probably left over after some office party. We
never had alcohol around. My parents did not drink. At least, so I
thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, to my surprise, he opened a can and said to take a sip and try
it out. I knew this was a &amp;ldquo;grownup&amp;rdquo; thing to do that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t supposed
to, so I eagerly tried it out. The taste was revolting. Meanwhile, he
drank the whole thing. Then he quickly got very red and acted funny. I
learned a couple of lessons immediately from this: he shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be
drinking, I hate beer, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get all red and funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I was completely immune, all the way through high school,
to any peer pressure to drink. Never mind that eventually I learned
that you may have to get used to the taste, or that there were entire
other worlds of alcohol, such as wine, that tasted different. For a
long time, I just didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like experimenting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time I drank alcohol again was right before college, some
champagne at an awards ceremony for a science competition that took
place the summer after I graduated from high school. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I
got red, but I was told that I was acting funny, and so I went to my
room and fell asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to a party the first week of college and there was beer, and
now under the influence of many new friends, I drank some. But I still
didn&amp;rsquo;t like it, didn&amp;rsquo;t like how everyone ended up behaving funny,
wasn&amp;rsquo;t too happy that we were all underage, and so I never drank again
in college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since college, I have now and then partaken of beer and wine, and
acquired more of an appreciation, but because I get very dizzy and
sleepy quickly, currently I almost completely avoid drinking. It&amp;rsquo;s
just for the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lecturing one&amp;rsquo;s children not to do something doesn&amp;rsquo;t always work, but
sometimes trickery apparently works. I&amp;rsquo;m not praising it or condemning
it, because I&amp;rsquo;ve endured other forms of trickery from my parents that
backfired. I&amp;rsquo;m just surprised by how strongly I reacted and how
susceptible I was to first negative experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have happy or sad examples of this kind of parental
  manipulation? Did they work on you or not, and was this to your
  long-term benefit or not? If you are a parent, are you above this
  trickery, or do you deliberately and cleverly use it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>RIP Robert Byrne, American chess grandmaster and columnist who gave my childhood meaning</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/04/15/rip-robert-byrne/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I learned today that the American chess grandmaster and columnist &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Byrne_%28chess_player%29&#34;&gt;Robert Byrne&lt;/a&gt; died last Friday, April 12, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon hearing this news, my mind was flooded immediately with childhood memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-scene&#34;&gt;The scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am eight years old, walking alone on a Sunday morning through the woods. I carry some pocket change given to me by my father. My task: go to a local convenience store in town to buy a copy of the New York Times to bring back home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the shortcut through the woods. When school is in session, I take that shortcut when I&amp;rsquo;m walking alone, whether stomping through crunchy autumn leaves, shivering through slushy snow, or getting shade as the school year is ending and the sun is bright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t always take the shortcut, because sometimes I walk to school with a friend or two who live in another direction, and in that case we walk over frozen ponds or run up and down the grassy hill instead (where I once fell going too fast and was lifted up by some older kids and brought back home; still have the scar on my right knee today). But the shortcut is my secret. I don&amp;rsquo;t tell my parents about the shortcut, because they might be worried. But it&amp;rsquo;s my private time to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;at-home&#34;&gt;At home&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I buy the newspaper, and keep it rolled up as I return home. My father likes to read about world news. But I like to read about chess. Magically, in this huge bundle of paper there is a chess column every week, by someone named Robert Byrne. In this column, he lists the moves to some recent chess game that is interesting, with his annotations and explanations of important moves in the game, places where someone made a bad move or found a great one. There are some diagrams to help out in case one does not have a chess board at hand to play out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My job is to clip out and save the chess column so that my father can staple it into his notebook. He likes collecting these chess columns. Where else could we hear about chess news from around the country and the world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of those days, my father gets particularly excited, because a &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/08/30/why-i-do-not-play-chess-online-chess-as-a-human-activity/&#34;&gt;Chinese player beat a Westerner (a Dutchman)&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so I keep on following the New York Times chess column, until we move to Michigan a year later, and I lost my ritual of getting the Sunday Times for the family. No longer living in the New York City area, my father buys a subscription to a local newspaper instead; there is no chess column in this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, Robert Byrne, for enriching the life of a young chess fan.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My father always said &#34;Think of it as exercise&#34;</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/01/26/my-father-always-said-think-of-it-as-exercise/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 26 Jan 2013 13:17:24 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/01/26/my-father-always-said-think-of-it-as-exercise/</guid>
      <description>&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/shoveled-sidewalk.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Shoveled sidewalk&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Maybe you have a father like mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was growing up, I noticed that every time there was some menial chore to do, he would tell me, &amp;ldquo;Think of it as &lt;em&gt;exercise&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hanging up clothing to dry (he doesn&amp;rsquo;t believe in dryers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;washing dishes (he doesn&amp;rsquo;t believe in dishwashers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mowing the lawn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;picking up and bagging the grass cuttings &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; mowing the lawn (since he didn&amp;rsquo;t believe in &amp;ldquo;high tech&amp;rdquo; lawn mowers with bag attachments)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;packing and carrying boxes when moving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hauling and assembling furniture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shoveling snow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t enjoy physical activity at all (being rather sickly and weak when young), so I treated his remark as a taunt and a way to get me to do chores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, it was partially a taunt. But underneath, given that he actually practices what he preaches, even today, there is something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now find myself saying &amp;ldquo;Think of it as exercise&amp;rdquo; too, both to Abby and to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happened? (No, I have not yet &amp;ldquo;become my father&amp;rdquo;!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-very-concept-of-exercise&#34;&gt;The very concept of exercise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve found that many people of my parents&amp;rsquo; generation have no concept of &amp;ldquo;exercise&amp;rdquo;, and for good reason: they grew up involved in much physical activity &lt;em&gt;out of necessity&lt;/em&gt;, and it was just a part of life. They didn&amp;rsquo;t have access to or could not afford to buy various &amp;ldquo;labor-saving&amp;rdquo; devices and services. So for them, going to the gym or something like that is just a totally foreign concept, something that only the freaks who were professional athletes or narcissists do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they&amp;rsquo;re right. It&amp;rsquo;s completely unnatural to spend vast amounts of time hooked up to some &amp;ldquo;exercise&amp;rdquo; machines if you&amp;rsquo;re actually going around chasing down deer, running after chickens, pulling weeds, building your own roof, washing loads of laundry, going to the river repeatedly to haul buckets of water back, walking miles to get anywhere at all, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human beings have always &lt;em&gt;moved&lt;/em&gt;. And we are adapted to move. The dilemma of modern industrialized life is that very often, we do not &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to move. We can outsource our labor to a machine or to someone else. Supposedly this is an advance because we can then exert our energies on &amp;ldquo;higher&amp;rdquo; pursuits, like writing labor-saving computer programs, endlessly being entertained by TV and YouTube, and writing blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;re-imagining-exercise&#34;&gt;Re-imagining exercise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I learned something a decade ago when I started &amp;ldquo;exercising&amp;rdquo; and changed my life. Although engaging in traditional &amp;ldquo;exercise&amp;rdquo; benefited me tremendously, I still did not feel &amp;ldquo;whole&amp;rdquo;, truly human. So over the years, I gradually backed away from what I considered &lt;em&gt;alienating&lt;/em&gt; forms of labor, toward more natural types of activities, to the point that most recently, I have moved toward &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/17/the-joys-of-convict-conditioning-bodyweight-exercising/&#34;&gt;body weight strength training&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past year, going even further in my awareness, I&amp;rsquo;ve gravitated toward actually finding value and opportunity in everyday chores that require physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; winter in my life in which I have not complained about shoveling snow, for example. (Not that it&amp;rsquo;s my favorite thing to do!) I &amp;ldquo;think of it as exercise&amp;rdquo;; I treat it as a serious, interesting workout. In the past, I&amp;rsquo;d just do it and grumble. Now, I do it &lt;em&gt;mindfully&lt;/em&gt;, thinking of which muscles I&amp;rsquo;m using and what form I have. Shoveling well is actually pretty tricky, because you have to watch your back, manage torque and leverage, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve not only gone out to shovel snow from my sidewalk when needed, but I&amp;rsquo;ve also stopped grumbling when one of my neighbors fails to shovel snow from their sidewalk. I just go and do theirs. Maybe they&amp;rsquo;re out of town or something. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what the reason, but the sidewalk needs to be shoveled and so I do it. It&amp;rsquo;s my exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, brushing snow off my own car is exercise as well and again, involves lots of interesting movements. I like using long cross-body swipes to be efficient at getting snow down and off my car.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/car-snow.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;My car with snow off&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to pretend that various physical chores are my favorite things to do, but by taking my father&amp;rsquo;s old advice, &amp;ldquo;Think of it as exercise,&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ve made life more interesting and fun for myself, and it makes me feel more connected to my core humanity as a physical being. Spending much of my earlier life living only in my mind was a mistake. There is much joy in simple physical pleasures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-of-2013-02-10&#34;&gt;(Update of 2013-02-10)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby alerted me to this article exploring the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-01/osu-sft012813.php&#34;&gt;benefits of everyday activity such as taking the stairs and raking leaves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The special bond between children and their fathers, through chess</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/01/13/the-special-bond-between-children-and-their-fathers-through-chess/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 13 Jan 2013 18:25:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/01/13/the-special-bond-between-children-and-their-fathers-through-chess/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was reading the January 2013 issue of &amp;ldquo;Chess Life&amp;rdquo; magazine (which you can read &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uschess.org/content/view/12035/365/&#34;&gt;online as PDF if you are a USCF member&lt;/a&gt;) and couldn&amp;rsquo;t help notice that by sheer coincidence, two different articles happened to mention how the article&amp;rsquo;s subject was shaped through their experiences playing chess in their childhood with their fathers. I was very moved because I always get emotional when &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/06/03/why-i-am-grateful-that-my-father-never-let-me-win-a-chess-game-against-him/&#34;&gt;reflecting on how chess gave me a special bond to my father&lt;/a&gt; as well. Similar stories are often true for children and their parents, through any shared activity at all, whether music, hunting, cooking, baseball, sewing, auto repair, stargazing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are two excerpts from the articles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;chess-life-article-excerpts&#34;&gt;Chess Life article excerpts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;corbin-seavers-of-the-potter-s-house-scholastic-chess-club&#34;&gt;Corbin Seavers of The Potter&amp;rsquo;s House Scholastic Chess Club&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seavers, who was an anti-apartheid activist, formed The Potter&amp;rsquo;s House Scholastic Chess Club to reach out to children, especially low income and minority youth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I only cared about chess because my father cared about chess. I only learned the game because my father taught it to me. That is why today I tell fathers chess is one way you can build a common interest and hobby with your child. It brought my father and me closer together, and I can say that it has definitely helped me in building a closer relationship with my daughter.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;alejandro-ramirez-young-grandmaster&#34;&gt;Alejandro Ramirez, young Grandmaster&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GM Ramirez achieved the GM title at age 15. In the article about him, he said quite a bit about the role of his father in his life and chess career. An excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
My dad was instrumental in my development as a person and as a chess player. Despite the fact that he can&#39;t really see tactics or see more than a few moves ahead, he has a deep understanding of psychology and can sense positions quite well. If I explain a game to him, he can infer things I can&#39;t see, such as the mood of the player, the causes for blunders and many others.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-father-and-chess-today&#34;&gt;My father and chess today&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heck, when I called home to my parents today, I asked my father whether he might start playing in chess tournaments again. It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time (about thirty years) since we used to play in tournaments together. If he were living near me, I&amp;rsquo;d be dragging him to the local tournaments that I have been playing in again. I think it&amp;rsquo;s great that he has been playing regularly for fun again after retiring, but there&amp;rsquo;s nothing like playing in an actual tournament, ha!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next time I see him, I&amp;rsquo;ll be sure to show some of my recent games to him, so we can laugh and talk s-t about the dumb moves I made or my opponent made. He likes seeing games. Every time we see each other, I give him all the issues of &amp;ldquo;Chess Life&amp;rdquo; that I&amp;rsquo;ve accumulated since the last visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-sister-and-chess&#34;&gt;My sister and chess&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My younger sister also played chess, but retired at the age of six, after her very first tournament, the Michigan Youth Championship, in which she played well and won a trophy. This is a sad story that was very instrumental in the development of her life, but since it is her story, I need to ask her whether I can tell it someday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you think about your childhood, what do you remember as being special and formative between you and your father or mother? Have you ever thanked them for what they gave you? Very often they might not even realize how important something was to you. Don&amp;rsquo;t wait until it is too late to show them your gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you are a parent, what do you think your children really appreciate about their relationship with you? You might be surprised. It might even be something that you think is trivial that they never talk about but is actually the most important thing to them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why I do not play chess online: chess as a human activity</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/08/30/why-i-do-not-play-chess-online-chess-as-a-human-activity/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Aug 2012 01:19:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/08/30/why-i-do-not-play-chess-online-chess-as-a-human-activity/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I found out, while reading the magazine &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_Life&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Chess Life&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, to which I am subscribed to as a &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/08/21/returning-to-chess/&#34;&gt;member of the United States Chess Federation&lt;/a&gt; (USCF), that there are apparently plans to offer &lt;a href=&#34;http://uschess.org/onlineplay/&#34;&gt;online chess play&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to confess that I have &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; been interested in playing chess online. I also do not like to play chess against computers, and not just because &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/05/30/life-lessons-i-learned-from-a-lunch-recess-chess-game-at-age-seven/&#34;&gt;my first experience playing chess against a computer was bizarrely negative&lt;/a&gt;. I understand that many people take great pleasure in both of these activities, but I still restrict myself to playing chess only against humans, and face to face. Here&amp;rsquo;s why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;growing-up-with-chess-with-my-father&#34;&gt;Growing up with chess with my father&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve written about some &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/06/03/why-i-am-grateful-that-my-father-never-let-me-win-a-chess-game-against-him/&#34;&gt;life lessons I learned from playing chess with my father&lt;/a&gt;, but not actually told the story of how we ended up joining the USCF and playing in rated tournaments. Here&amp;rsquo;s the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;taking-chess-more-seriously-in-the-3rd-grade-because-of-china&#34;&gt;Taking chess more seriously in the 3rd grade because of China&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/06/01/life-lessons-i-learned-from-a-lunch-recess-chess-game-with-a-classmate-at-age-seven/&#34;&gt;getting into chess more seriously in the 2nd grade because of a strange incident at school&lt;/a&gt;. My story picks up from there in the 3rd grade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day in 1978, my father excitedly clipped out a chess game annotated in the regular chess column in the Sunday New York Times, and showed it to me playing it out. He might still have this clipping saved somewhere in a folder. It was a famous (notorious) game in which a relatively weak chess master from China, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Wenzhe&#34;&gt;Liu Wenzhe&lt;/a&gt;, won against a Dutchman, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Hein_Donner&#34;&gt;Jan Hein Donner&lt;/a&gt;, a strong grandmaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to understand that in the 1970s, China was not taken seriously in the West. This was the first time in which a chess player of Chinese descent had scored a major upset against a Westerner. For my father, this was a big deal: he had always played a good game of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiangqi&#34;&gt;Chinese chess&lt;/a&gt;, but never invested any time in improving at &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Western&amp;rdquo; chess&lt;/a&gt;. Just seeing that someone of Chinese descent could play well caused him to become truly enthusiastic about Western chess. (For the curious, here is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lubomir-kavalek/chess-in-clouds-of-smoke_b_1270659.html&#34;&gt;record of the famous Donner-Liu game&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From that day on, every time I walked off to the local store on Sunday morning to buy the New York Times to bring back home, my father and I would immediately clip out the chess column and study it together. We both got more serious about studying chess books we got from the public library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-of-2013-04-15&#34;&gt;(Update of 2013-04-15)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author of the New York Times chess column, Robert Byrne, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/04/15/rip-robert-byrne/&#34;&gt;just died&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;fourth-grade-joining-the-local-chess-club&#34;&gt;Fourth grade: joining the local chess club&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we moved after my third grade, my father found out that there was a chess club that met in the basement of the local community center, and he brought me there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cigar-smoke-and-chess-with-the-guys&#34;&gt;Cigar smoke and chess with the guys&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was quite an experience entering the chess club. The place was filled with cigar smoke and loud men slamming chess pieces around, wisecracking and swearing. Many of the guys were old, but there were younger guys also, although the youngest one was about twenty years old; I was just ten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow, in the midst of this chaos, I was welcomed to the club and enjoyed playing. Sometimes my six-year-old sister came along too, but it was clear that she didn&amp;rsquo;t really belong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tournaments&#34;&gt;Tournaments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t long before the guys told us about USCF and ratings and tournaments and encouraged us to join USCF and play in rated tournaments. So my father and I signed up and played in the Michigan Open. We both won trophies in our first tournament, and continued to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;social&#34;&gt;Social&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, a very shy boy who had relatively little interaction with his schoolmates outside of school, playing chess became the closest thing I had to a &lt;em&gt;social life&lt;/em&gt;. So I have always associated chess with being social, with seeing people smile and frown, with sitting across from someone and noticing his (or very occasionally, her) changes in emotion, concentration, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;playing-chess-against-computers-or-by-means-of-a-computer&#34;&gt;Playing chess against computers or by means of a computer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never even touched a chess computer again (after my mentioned initial experience in the 2nd grade) until well into high school, when I bought a &lt;a href=&#34;http://tluif.home.xs4all.nl/chescom/EngFidExc.html&#34;&gt;Fidelity Excellence&lt;/a&gt; in the 11th grade. Playing against this computer was frustrating. In the mid-1980s, an affordable chess computer or program was still rather weak. I had no real fun playing with the computer. My enjoyment of chess was tied to the human aspects of the game rather than the purely calculational aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t really touch chess again after high school until twenty years later. I was surprised by how much better computers had gotten but again took no pleasure in playing against a program running on my computer. And I saw that online chess had become popular, but had no interest in participating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;back-to-humanity&#34;&gt;Back to humanity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2004, I became a member again of the USCF and started receiving &amp;ldquo;Chess Life&amp;rdquo; in the mail. I opened up the first issue I received, and noticed that it had an article mentioning my old chess buddy &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Finegold&#34;&gt;Ben Finegold&lt;/a&gt; whom I first met back in the cigar-smoke chess club days in Michigan when I was ten and he was eleven. We&amp;rsquo;d played a good amount of blitz chess together as well as three rated tournament games. Unlike me, he went off to become a chess professional and one of the top chess players in the US, while my chess skill stagnated and I went to college, etc. I wondered whether to take up chess again, to see if I could continue my improvement where I left off as a kid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While visiting my parents for Christmas in 2004, I challenged my father to a chess game for the first time in over twenty years. We played, I did well, and when I returned to Pittsburgh, I searched online and found the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pittsburghcc.org/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Chess Club&lt;/a&gt; and stopped by for a visit. The guys were really friendly, I started playing blitz chess, like the old days, and in early January 2005, I joined the club and registered for my first tournaments in twenty years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was good to be back. To humanity, really, more so than to chess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes me feel old-fashioned, but I have no interest in playing chess online. To me, the game simply has a deeper significance to me than some kind of intellectual puzzle, a significance rooted in its role in my life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing a lot recent about life lessons learned from playing chess as a kid. Here are some life lessons I learned as a result of the fact that &lt;strong&gt;my father never let me win a chess game against him&lt;/strong&gt;. Based on what I have seen adults doing with children, I somewhat suspect this is unusual. I get the impression that parents like to let their children &amp;ldquo;win&amp;rdquo; at something, presumably for the purpose of giving them a &amp;ldquo;self-esteem&amp;rdquo; boost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to demonstrate compassion and judgment in encouraging children in their pursuits, but based on my own experience, I am not sure it is necessary to let a kid &amp;ldquo;win&amp;rdquo; when the win is nowhere near deserved objectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My father &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; let me win a chess game against him. I played many games with him starting from around age 3, and I did not win a single chess game against him until age eleven, on my own merits alone, when I had overtaken him in my strength. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what his rationale was, but I do know what his behavior taught me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-life-lessons&#34;&gt;The life lessons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reason and logic have a force of their own, that lies beyond nepotism and other external factors, and must be respected and cultivated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes one deserves to lose, based on reality, and a child should learn to be a loser and not let losing be correlated with self-esteem or love.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Children at some point can detect lying, and my father showed me respect by not pretending to lose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Children also appreciate compassion, and I knew my father was not always playing at full strength (he magically got better as I got better), but also knew that by not playing at full strength he made the game challenging yet fun for me, rather than demoralizing and impossible to learn level-appropriate lessons from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I actually finally won, it was a big deal, not something that just randomly happened for no reason; I knew that I had reached a true milestone in my life, in which I had through hard work actually surpassed my father at something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;postscript&#34;&gt;Postscript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it turned out that when I won my first game with my father, that was the last game we ever played again for two decades. We never talked about why we stopped playing. After that game, simultaneously neither of us asked again to play the other. There was some kind of unspoken awkwardness. I was heading toward puberty and had begun acting up and resisting authority by that time, and he had been discouraged in his own quest for chess improvement, so he basically quit playing chess after I beat him for the first time. It was an awkward time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We played our first game in decades only when I was into my thirties and I was visiting one Christmas and invited him to play. We played, and I showed no mercy, and I won, but it was an honest game. Like old days. We still play now and then when visiting each other. He knows my level, I know his level, and we know I am basically always going to win, but what can we do other than play some honest games and enjoy the artistry we create together, no matter who wins?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of official competitions, winning is not the only thing. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t when I was a child, and it isn&amp;rsquo;t now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;photo-of-me-playing-chess-with-my-father-in-summer-2010&#34;&gt;Photo of me playing chess with my father in summer 2010&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found a photo of my father and me playing a game of chess at my parents&amp;rsquo; home when Abby and I were visiting in summer 2010. (My actual first chess game with my father in two decades was when I was visiting over Christmas 2004.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-of-2013-02-27&#34;&gt;(Update of 2013-02-27)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The renowned chess instructor Bruce Pandolfini gave a nuanced, thoughtful answer to a parent&amp;rsquo;s question about whether to let a child win. (&lt;strong&gt;Update of 2013-12-22&lt;/strong&gt;: Unfortunately, the link I originally provided to his article no longer works, as Chess Cafe has begun removing archives of its content).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still think that how my father operated worked out well for me. I learned to value getting better, rather than winning. I trusted that getting better would eventually lead to winning, and it did. Even as an adult who has limited time and ambition, I still value getting better over winning. And &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/02/20/pittsburgh-chess-club-championship-2013-round-6-winning-as-black-like-a-madman/&#34;&gt;I just won the 2013 Pittsburgh Chess Club Championship&lt;/a&gt;. I am in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pscfchess.org/ratings/regtoppa.htm&#34;&gt;top 40 of the active rated chess players in Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be here if my father had not instilled in me a love of excellence and an honest self-evaluation. I don&amp;rsquo;t even feel good when I win. I only feel good when I judge that I &lt;em&gt;deserved&lt;/em&gt; to win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-of-2013-12-22&#34;&gt;(Update of 2013-12-22)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hugh Patterson at The Chess Improver posted a great article &lt;a href=&#34;http://chessimprover.com/some-thoughts-for-parents/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Some Thoughts for Parents&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, although I am not a parent yet, I am teaching chess now, so I&amp;rsquo;m personally facing practical decision-making in how I try to simultaneously install love for chess, sheer fun, and a healthy drive for excellence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-of-2015-12-21&#34;&gt;(Update of 2015-12-21)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years later, I made a focused push, temporarily putting many
things aside in my life, in the fall of 2015 to &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2016/01/22/on-finally-achieving-the-us-national-master-chess-title-at-age-45-part-1&#34;&gt;achieve my US Chess
National Master&lt;/a&gt; title, and finally made it, a dream come true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it wasn&amp;rsquo;t winning that matters to me in this achievement: it is
that I have actually been playing pretty well and feel I finally
deserved the title. When I was not playing well, I did not feel I
deserved.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>They published my brilliant chess game, hinting it was not so original, but was it?</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/06/02/they-published-my-brilliant-chess-game/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 02 Jun 2012 12:19:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/06/02/they-published-my-brilliant-chess-game/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The past couple of days, I have been writing about what I learned through playing chess as a kid. I continue today by discussion a game I played right before retiring from chess at age fifteen. This game came to my mind when I was writing about the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/05/30/life-lessons-i-learned-from-a-lunch-recess-chess-game-at-age-seven/&#34;&gt;chess computer game I played at age seven&lt;/a&gt;, because I played against the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence,_Accelerated_Dragon&#34;&gt;Accelerated Dragon of the Sicilian Defense&lt;/a&gt; in that game, and in my retirement tournament I also played a game against that opening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My final tournament before I started the 11th grade and became fully absorbed in academic study was kind of special because I played reasonably well, achieving an Expert rating just as I retired, jumping from a rating of 1934 to over 2000, and because it was one of those tournaments held in East Lansing, which meant visiting and staying with my &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/03/16/remembering-my-uncle-steve/&#34;&gt;aunt and uncle and cousins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game I played in the Michigan Open was the second to last chess game I played in a serious tournament before returning to chess over twenty years later. It ended up being published in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michess.org/interim/magazine/1980s/MC8510.pdf&#34;&gt;following Michigan Chess magazine issue&lt;/a&gt;, warranting a short note that it was reminiscent of a &amp;ldquo;famous Fischer-Reshevsky debacle&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;pride-or-shame-creative-or-original&#34;&gt;Pride or shame? Creative or original?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was playing my game, I was feeling pretty proud of my winning combination, even though I knew it was not completely original; I in fact had been inspired by a theme in the Fischer-Reshevsky game that I had remembered when first encountering it in a book with my father back when I was eight years old. When I read the Michigan Chess magazine column and saw that, of course, the editor saw the resemblance, I felt deflated. As a result, I never showed my father the mention of my game in the magazine, nor did I show the game to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But today, I am going to display this game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-game&#34;&gt;My game&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my game, I embarked on a double sacrifice combination that, if one had never seen the theme before, looks spectacular. If one had seen the theme before, it might look boring. But actually, it required accurate calculation to make the concrete variation of the theme actually work: playing simply by analogy is disastrous in chess because any small difference in a position can radically change its evaluation. So although I cannot take credit for spotting the theme, I think I can take credit for making sure that it actually applies in context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the critical position of my game, with White to play and win:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../chess/accelerated-dragon-trap_files/diag3FDFE53F3ECA481F.gif&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Chen-Winfield, Michigan Open 1985&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here is the critical position of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1008376&#34;&gt;Fischer-Reshevsky, US Championship 1958&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../chess/accelerated-dragon-trap_files/diag3FDFE554B3C66396.gif&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Fischer-Reshevsky, US Championship 1958&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you have not seen either game before, do you see the similarities? Can you spot the forced wins?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-full-annotations&#34;&gt;The full annotations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out my annotations of both &lt;a href=&#34;../../chess/accelerated-dragon-trap.htm&#34;&gt;my game and Bobby Fischer&amp;rsquo;s game&lt;/a&gt;. My annotations go further into what I was thinking during the game. (The game page pops up defaulting to showing my game; use the upper-right corner selection menu to switch view to Fischer&amp;rsquo;s game.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-discussion-of-the-theme-and-variations&#34;&gt;A discussion of the theme and variations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you have looked through the games now, you can see that the basic theme is of trying to trap Black&amp;rsquo;s Queen and win it, and in order to avoid losing the Queen immediately, Black has to move the King out and risk being checkmated. And the key moves for White are to play Bxf7+ to remove the f Pawn that defends e6, and then Ne6 attacking the Queen. What is critical is evaluating whether Black can just take the Knight on e6 with the King and survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some real differences in how the theme plays out in my game and Fischer&amp;rsquo;s game:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Fischer&amp;rsquo;s game, the Queen really is trapped; and taking the Knight on e6 with the King leads to a quick forced checkmate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In my game, the Queen is not actually trapped, because the Queen can always go to e8, but in that case, I win the rook on c7 instead; finally, in my game, Black can in fact take the Knight on e6 with the King, and this does not lead to a forced checkmate, because Black has Bxc3+ freeing up the g7 square for the King to possibly escape to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, I should not have been too ashamed by the resemblance to Fischer&amp;rsquo;s game, because there were real differences that lead to completely different calculations and variations in winning the game. I did have to use my own mind. The calculations are not so hard for a strong player, but I was not even at an Expert rating yet at the time, so my game was pretty good for a Class A rated player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-have-learned&#34;&gt;What I have learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some useful lessons I have learned upon revisiting this game:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having a deep background in already existing knowledge (such as already played games) helps one spot a theme and apply it in a new situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no shame in stealing and using someone&amp;rsquo;s good idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even when stealing an idea, it requires one&amp;rsquo;s own ingenuity to make sure it works in a new context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not let your own honest judgment of your work be swayed too much by what is said about it in a publication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I could have been more proud of myself in front of my parents when I was a kid and shared my excitement at my personal accomplishments.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two days ago, I wrote about &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/05/30/life-lessons-i-learned-from-a-lunch-recess-chess-game-at-age-seven/&#34;&gt;life lessons I learned from playing a chess game against a computer in the 2nd grade during lunch recess&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I&amp;rsquo;m writing about what I learned from the only other chess game I played on site in elementary school. I played this game much earlier than the computer game; I played it with a classmate who had seen me looking at chess books in the classroom library and challenged me to a game. Let&amp;rsquo;s call him X. Here are our school photos:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Classmate in 2nd grade I played one chess game with&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-game-with-x&#34;&gt;My game with X&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was nervous when we sat down to play, because I had up till this point never played chess with anyone but my father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody was watching us. It was just the two of us sitting on the floor in a corner where books and games were stored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The game lasted no more than two minutes; it lasted four moves before ending!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;X was playing very quickly, spending no more than a split second per move. Furthermore, he played completely unlike my father and unlike any of the sample instructive games I had seen in chess books. His first move, h4, totally confused and unnerved me. I tried to play according to vague principles I recalled about how one should play, moving my center Pawns, even as he did a strange Rook lift maneuver I had never seen in my entire life. On his third move, he attacked my e Pawn with this rogue Rook and I protected it. On his fourth move, he attacked my Pawn with his d Pawn. We had reached this position:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/second-grade-chess-game.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;My only chess game with another kid in elementary school&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I got excited because it looked like he had made a mistake. His Pawn on d4 is protected only once, by his Queen, while I was attacking it with both my Knight and my Pawn at e5. Therefore, his Pawn was &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; for me to take!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I momentarily overlooked that my e Pawn was pinned and took his d Pawn with my e Pawn. (Note: taking the Pawn with the Knight would have lost it; X was definitely no dummy and may even have been a far better chess player than me at the time.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-argument&#34;&gt;The argument&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;X, who had something of a stern, morose temperament, suddenly broke out into a big smile of victory, grabbed his Rook and took my King, jumped up from the ground, and said he won the game!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I protested that I had overlooked that I had made an illegal move, and asked him to give my King back so that I could put all the pieces back to where they were before I made the illegal move, saying that we can&amp;rsquo;t make illegal moves, and Kings cannot be captured in chess, so not only could I not take the Pawn, but he also could not take my King. (I was correct, of course; illegal moves cannot be allowed to stand, and the King can never be taken during a chess turn.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;X refused to listen to me and just gloated. As I had no desire to create a scene and ask for a teacher to adjudicate our dispute, I just walked away. I never played a chess game with him again, and I never told anyone in my life about this incident, until today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;life-lessons-i-learned&#34;&gt;Life lessons I learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the things I learned from this incident:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X may have gotten away with claiming to have won against me, but lost a potential playmate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some people are uninformed but very sure they are right, and there is no use arguing with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even when playing a game by the rules, the ultimate outcome in the real world may depend on whether others are playing by the rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I needed more experience in facing unexpected, strange openings and strategies, in order to avoid getting mentally flustered and inattentive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I needed more experience in staying calm against someone who behaved aggressively and intimidated me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I needed to look at the larger context when it seemed that something was free for the taking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I needed to pay more attention to threats directed toward my King from afar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I needed to be &amp;ldquo;defensive&amp;rdquo; against illegal game endings by not making illegal moves myself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-did-with-what-i-learned&#34;&gt;What I did with what I learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;X did me a little favor by teaching me all these lessons. I went home and actually studied his Rook strategy and came up with ways to deal with it if anyone ever played it against me again. I also never played an illegal move again in my life. (Note: up till this point, I was still having some problems &amp;ldquo;seeing&amp;rdquo; that pieces or Pawns of mine were pinned, and would sometimes play illegal moves against my father too.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also decided it was time to go beyond kids&amp;rsquo; chess books and learn more about strategy, going beyond just the basic rules and counting piece points. Luckily for me, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gti.net/mocolib1/&#34;&gt;Morris County Library&lt;/a&gt; had a great chess collection, and I got my father to drive us there regularly, where we took out lots of chess books (as well as books on all the other subjects that interested me). My father never asked me why I was getting so excited about chess, but was happy to get into it more himself. We went over serious game collections and opening books, for the first time in our lives, and in months I felt I was much more informed and stronger as a chess player. That set the stage for my proud accomplishment of obtaining a &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/05/30/life-lessons-i-learned-from-a-lunch-recess-chess-game-at-age-seven/&#34;&gt;winning position against a chess computer later in the 2nd grade&lt;/a&gt;, which also taught me more life lessons already discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Recently, I have had the opportunity to play chess casually with kids at parties. I could not help reflecting on my own childhood memories of playing chess. I feel that there was much I learned about life from the chess activities of my youth, whether casual or serious. This is the first of a planned series of posts about chess.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This post is about the first time I played with a chess computer and was surprised to find myself winning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-little-bit-of-my-chess-history&#34;&gt;A little bit of my chess history&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supposedly I first learned chess at some time between the ages of two and three, accidentally picking it up while my father was learning the game along with grad student classmates of his. At the time chess was becoming extremely popular in the United States because of the &amp;ldquo;Fischer boom&amp;rdquo; resulting from &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Fischer&#34;&gt;Bobby Fischer&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s world championship match and victory against Boris Spassky. Since I don&amp;rsquo;t remember anything from before age two and a half (I remember the months leading up to my celebrating my third birthday), I don&amp;rsquo;t remember a time when I didn&amp;rsquo;t know at least the basic rules of chess!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;kindergarten&#34;&gt;Kindergarten&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was in Kindergarten, I came across some chess books targeted toward children and filled in some gaps (since my father actually had been confused about some of the rules, involving the details of castling and capturing &lt;em&gt;en passant&lt;/em&gt;). I played casually with my father, but nobody else, getting beaten every time (although in retrospect, I have doubts about whether we were playing completely legal games).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;second-grade&#34;&gt;Second grade&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the second grade in elementary school, I was much improved because I had started going through chess books geared toward adults, checked out from the local public library. I had earlier spent some time in the school library going through all the basic chess books there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chess-challenger-iii&#34;&gt;Chess Challenger III&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://tluif.home.xs4all.nl/chescom/CC3.JPG&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Chess Challenger III from 1977&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One day at lunch recess, a lunch proctor who had heard that I played chess brought me her new &lt;a href=&#34;http://tluif.home.xs4all.nl/chescom/EngCc3.html&#34;&gt;Chess Challenger III&lt;/a&gt; computer. I started playing a game with it (with me as White and the computer as Black). To my surprise, I was winning against this computer, which had fallen into a trap I had set! (Up until this point, I had only ever played chess with my father, and he had always won.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White to play and win:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../chess/chess-challenger-iii_files/diag3FE05522BFCEDF4D.gif&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Critical position in game&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the bell rang shortly after I had trapped Chess Challenger III&amp;rsquo;s Queen and I excitedly told everyone I was beating the computer. The proctor just sniffed and dismissed my claim, practically calling me a liar. I never talked to her again in my life and never asked to play the computer again for a rematch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I learned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chess computers are not perfect, and even a child might play better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adults in school often misunderstand or disrespect students who do something unexpected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-game-against-chess-challenger-iii&#34;&gt;My game against Chess Challenger III&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have fully annotated my one and only &lt;a href=&#34;../../chess/chess-challenger-iii.htm&#34;&gt;game against Chess Challenger III&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am guessing the computer was set at a default &amp;ldquo;easy&amp;rdquo; level; I am guessing that at its highest level (which unfortunately would have led to its playing too slowly in a recess setting), I may not have been able to beat it. I had never played with anyone other than my father by this age (I started playing with other people only at age ten, with some exceptions I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss later), but I&amp;rsquo;m guessing my ELO rating strength at age seven was probably no higher than 1200.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Remembering my Uncle Steve</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/03/16/remembering-my-uncle-steve/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Mar 2012 18:19:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/03/16/remembering-my-uncle-steve/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I got a call from my mother informing me that my Uncle Steve, husband of my mother&amp;rsquo;s sister Aunt Soo-kin, died yesterday. He had been sick for quite some time, and last year, in the hospital for something else, they found cancer in addition, so it was a very tough battle for him, and he was always a fighter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was very grateful for the opportunity in July 2010 to visit Aunt and Uncle in East Lansing when he was still very much active. I had not seen either of them in possibly twenty years; my parents and Abby and I went up to their home, and they got to meet Abby for the very first time (he was not well when we married in 2009).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the only photo I currently have of him (my parents have the family photo album that must have a lot more photos from the past forty years since we&amp;rsquo;ve all been in the United States). (From left to right: Abby, my mother, Aunt Soo-kin, my father, and Uncle Steve.)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Update: my brother-in-law André just sent me some more photos, from the wedding of my sister Linda and him in 2010 that he did manage to attend.)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What do I remember most about Uncle Steve, and how did he impact my life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-visit-in-july-2010&#34;&gt;The visit in July 2010&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncle Steve was full of energy and insisted on taking us around Lansing, giving all of us a tour of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_Capitol&#34;&gt;Michigan State Capitol&lt;/a&gt; as well as the Michigan State University campus, especially the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cpa.msu.edu/beal/&#34;&gt;botanical garden&lt;/a&gt;. He also took us to his favorite Chinese buffet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, typical of him, he had originally planned to get us on a cruise on the river. We had gone down to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lansingcitymarket.com/&#34;&gt;Lansing City Market&lt;/a&gt;, where he bought tickets, but then it turned out that the timing was bad and nothing was available that day, so we had to cancel on the plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;uncle-steve-s-traits&#34;&gt;Uncle Steve&amp;rsquo;s traits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main thing I will always remember about Uncle Steve is how different he was from other relatives. He was very energetic and aggressive, outspoken, adventurous compared to the rest of us. The way he talked, drove, and ate was quite different from how my father behaved, so in my childhood, the contrast between my two main adult male role models was striking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw him (and aunt and their two children, my cousins) more often when I was in elementary school, middle school, high school in Michigan. Then when I went off to college, I saw them much less often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-number-one-memory-how-to-take-risks-and-win&#34;&gt;My number one memory: how to take risks and win&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a child, sometimes I had the opportunity to play ping pong. I didn&amp;rsquo;t do it often, because we didn&amp;rsquo;t have the space, but every time we went up to East Lansing to visit Uncle and Aunt and my cousins, I looked forward to using their ping pong table. I got to play with my father, and then Uncle would step in and totally destroy both of us with his ultra-aggressive style. He was pretty serious about anything competitive (he played tennis also), and he had high-quality ping pong bats such that he could create a lot of spin, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main thing is that Uncle Steve moved fast and went for hard, fast killer shots whenever possible (while using the backhand spin defensively as appropriate). He didn&amp;rsquo;t always make it, but he went for it. I really admired his style of play. He used a &lt;a href=&#34;http://tabletennis.about.com/od/griptypes/a/jkpenholdgrip.htm&#34;&gt;Japanese-style penhold grip&lt;/a&gt; to maximize his forehand attacking style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used the Chinese-style penhold grip (learned from my father) for a long time whenever I played ping pong. The Japanese-style grip seemed too extreme for me. In any case, from Uncle Steve I learned to &lt;em&gt;stay on the attack&lt;/em&gt; in ping pong. Even though for much of my life I used to be shy and anxious, there were a couple of areas in my life in which I adopted a relentlessly aggressive persona. I have Uncle Steve to thank for showing me how it&amp;rsquo;s done. To this day, if I play ping pong, I will play in an attacking style, not a defensive style. I will err on the side of hitting the ball out of control and out of play losing points rather than playing &amp;ldquo;safe&amp;rdquo; and missing an opportunity to hit a winner. I don&amp;rsquo;t really know why, but I somehow absorbed this huge &lt;em&gt;life lesson&lt;/em&gt; from Uncle Steve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point, I did start switching around between the penhold grip and the shake-hand grip, because of comfort. I don&amp;rsquo;t play ping pong much these days; I think the last time was a year ago when I was back at my parents&amp;rsquo; home, where they have had a ping pong table for twenty years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a photo of my father and me playing ping pong twenty years ago:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-closing&#34;&gt;In closing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncle Steve leaves behind his wife, two children, and their children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Uncle Steve never got to see my new nephew Jack, born last month. But the cycle of life continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will miss Uncle Steve&amp;rsquo;s energy and fighting spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How school made me hate computer science and programming</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/01/16/how-school-made-me-hate-computer-science-and-programming/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Jan 2012 19:57:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/01/16/how-school-made-me-hate-computer-science-and-programming/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some months ago, when the legendary computer scientist &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)&#34;&gt;John McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; died, I wrote a blog post in which I briefly reminisced about the way &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/25/rip-john-mccarthy-but-lisp-will-never-die/&#34;&gt;I hated computer programming before I came to love it&lt;/a&gt;. Today I am filling in some more details about how school (elementary school through college) made me fear, misunderstand, and hate computer science and programming. I am inspired to do this because&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just a few weeks ago, I came across an old article from 1992 by someone who had a similar experience, and I wanted to complete my story. Although my story also goes back more than two decades, I feel that the same fundamental stumbling blocks exist to &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/12/09/why-everyone-should-learn-computer-science/&#34;&gt;the universal computational competence that I now advocate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The topic of learning &amp;ldquo;coding&amp;rdquo; has exploded into the popular media, with hundreds of thousands of people having signed up for &lt;a href=&#34;http://codeyear.com/&#34;&gt;Code Year&lt;/a&gt; and even New York Mayor Bloomberg stating that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.businessinsider.com/mike-bloomberg-pledges-to-learn-to-code-on-codecademy-this-year-2012-1&#34;&gt;he has signed up&lt;/a&gt; for the free &lt;a href=&#34;http://codecademy.com/&#34;&gt;Codecademy&lt;/a&gt; online tutorial courses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goals in telling my story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to raise awareness among those who might this year be jumping into &amp;ldquo;coding&amp;rdquo; that they might encounter the same kinds of stumbling blocks that discouraged me at first, so that they don&amp;rsquo;t prematurely jump to such conclusions as &amp;ldquo;programming is boring and confusing&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;programming requires special talent I don&amp;rsquo;t have&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want for educators to take note of the barriers facing students who may not be &amp;ldquo;naturals&amp;rdquo; to understanding computation or writing computer programs in the context of currently common programming environments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a forthcoming article, I will engage in a severe critique of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://codecademy.com/&#34;&gt;Codeacademy&lt;/a&gt; lessons I have so far examined and gone through, while helping my wife learn programming from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;6th-grade-and-basic-in-the-early-1980s&#34;&gt;6th grade and BASIC in the early 1980s&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was in middle school in the 6th grade, my math teacher was crazy about computers. He was convinced that his best math students, including me, should learn computer programming. I was basically coerced into staying after school for sessions in which he taught us to program in BASIC for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80&#34;&gt;TRS-80 microcomputer&lt;/a&gt;. The BASIC language was very primitive. We used line numbers and &lt;code&gt;GOTO&lt;/code&gt;. Some boys got totally into programming, and tried writing video games. I was not one of them. I was not a natural at programming. I will admit it: I never really understood &lt;code&gt;GOSUB&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;PEEK&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;POKE&lt;/code&gt; at the time. In fact, one beautiful spring day, since it was nice outside, I decided to simply walk home from school instead of staying around for his class. After missing a couple of sessions, I was shocked that he contacted my parents and basically made me continue on. I finished out the year, then never wrote a BASIC program again (until college).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did like playing computer games, however. I just had no interest in making them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;7th-grade-and-pac-man&#34;&gt;7th grade and Pac-Man&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 7th grade, I was crazy about video games and my sister and I managed to save enough allowance money to buy an &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600&#34;&gt;Atari 2600&lt;/a&gt; video game console. I had encountered an IBM PC by then, but had no interest in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;9th-grade-and-my-first-programming-class&#34;&gt;9th grade and my first programming class&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started high school in the 9th grade, there was a requirement that all students take a semester of &amp;ldquo;computer literacy&amp;rdquo;. After several meetings of that class, I wanted out. We were shown slides of tape drives, told about bits and bytes, and I had no interest whatsoever in any of that. I heard that there was a way out of the requirement, which was to take an actual computer programming class. Since my father was working as a mainframe programmer (his degree in information sciences being from the 1970s), he suggested I take &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL&#34;&gt;COBOL&lt;/a&gt;, which were offered by my high school (in addition to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran&#34;&gt;Fortran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_RPG&#34;&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt; and probably others I don&amp;rsquo;t remember).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I switched to the COBOL class. Here we learned about pseudocode, used &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.retroist.com/2009/01/11/ibm-flowcharting-template/&#34;&gt;flowchart templates&lt;/a&gt; to draw symbols on paper, wrote our programs out in pencil, and used the big keypunch machine to punch out our programs. Every day we had the opportunity to submit a punch card deck to the teacher (with the appropriate job control and compiler cards) to drop off for overnight processing at some mainframe somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hated the class. The whole rigid process we were supposed to go through, the verbosity of the COBOL language, and the nature of the programs we wrote, made computing seem very boring. I started not doing any homework, and after several weeks, I was failing the class, and the teacher called my parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dutifully caught up on all the missing programming projects, got my A in the class, and then never touched COBOL again, and forgot any COBOL I &lt;em&gt;pretended&lt;/em&gt; to learn while basically copying and pasting from example programs in the textbook and modifying stuff until it &amp;ldquo;worked&amp;rdquo;. I have a confession to make: despite my A in the class, I never really understood COBOL or programming. I was just going through the motions. It was truly &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;cargo-cult programming&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;This is a warning to all educators to actually verify whether someone has learned something, as opposed to cleverly faked it!&lt;/strong&gt; (I will come to this subject again.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;10th-grade-and-pascal&#34;&gt;10th grade and Pascal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 10th grade (in a new high school), my math teacher made it mandatory to write some rudimentary programs in Pascal to illustrate the trigonometry and other stuff we were learning. We used the MacPascal interpreter on the Macintosh for this purpose: there was a computer lab where we did our work and printed out our programs and results. I have almost no memory of any of this except that I was intrigued by the automatic formatting and the proportional fonts in MacPascal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should note that at this time in my life, I had no interest in computers. We still did not have one at home, and I had long since outgrown the Atari video game console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;11th-grade-and-advanced-placement-computer-science&#34;&gt;11th grade and Advanced Placement computer science&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 11th grade, I had the opportunity to take an Advanced Placement course in computer science, taught using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)&#34;&gt;Pascal&lt;/a&gt; programming language. (I mentioned this in &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/25/rip-john-mccarthy-but-lisp-will-never-die/&#34;&gt;my previous article&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I signed up for the class. You might wonder why, given that I had no interest in computers or programming (in Pascal or any other language). I had a perverse incentive. Advanced Placement courses were advertised as a way to get out of equivalent courses in college. I figured that if I ended up in college with a computing course requirement, I wanted to place out of it! So I signed up for Advanced Placement computer science because I &lt;em&gt;hated&lt;/em&gt; computers and wanted to get the pain over with earlier rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course was taught by a math teacher who made us use as a textbook a book that I found totally over my head, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Solve-Computer-Prentice-Hall-International-Science/dp/0134340019&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;How to Solve It by Computer&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m betting that if I had a copy of this book now to look at, I might actually enjoy it, but at the time, it was forbidding. It was all about &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_invariant&#34;&gt;loop invariants&lt;/a&gt;, proving your algorithms to be correct, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One side effect of the course was that pretty soon it became clear that it was the most time-consuming course. I simply did not have enough time in the computer lab to get my programs running correctly. I had my father buy me an Apple IIe computer so that I could do my coding and debugging at home into the wee hours of the night as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found it annoyingly difficult to get out of the BASIC and COBOL mindset into the &amp;ldquo;structured programming&amp;rdquo; enforced by Pascal. As a result, I am sensitive to the idea that &amp;ldquo;learning&amp;rdquo; inferior programming languages can genuinely get in the way of further progress as a programmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not enjoy the class at all, but did enjoy the side effect of having a computer at home, which I used for playing some games as well as for word processing, so that I no longer needed to use a typewriter and scissors to work on drafts of papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I will admit that for much of the class, I was proceeding with no real understanding of what I was doing. I was copying and pasting and cargo-culting my way through the class, and through my receiving a 5 on the Advanced Placement exam. After this class, I thought I was done with programming for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem was that we never wrote any programs to do anything I found interesting, and was never exposed to the general possibilities of what we could do through programming. Writing a recursive program to generate fractals was not very interesting to me. My biggest project in the class was writing a program to maintain a library of books and be able to sort and search it and write it out to floppy disk and read it back in. That was also not very interesting to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;motivations&#34;&gt;Motivations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hobbies at the time included playing chess, learning languages (I was enthusiastic about French and had taught myself Latin), reading lots of books. If the world had been different then, and someone had told me what I could do by knowing how to program, I could have been very interested. For example, suppose that the Web existed then. Suppose someone told me that by knowing how to program, I could write code to create my own flashcard system for learning languages. Then there would be a question of whether an application already exists for purchase that can do that. (It turns out that I have never been satisfied with any flashcard program I have used.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that to attract interest in computer programming, it is vital to give people reasons that they can relate to. And it is not helpful to &lt;em&gt;discourage&lt;/em&gt; potential programmers by telling them that they should be doing something else, like, just focusing on being a doctor or salesman, giving the argument that the &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; programmers are already doing their job creating applications ready to use, and that therefore &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage&#34;&gt;comparative advantage&lt;/a&gt; says that only professional programmers should learn how to program. This is like telling someone centuries ago that it is no use learning to read or write because others can already do it and probably do it much better. I think the proliferation of information means that more and more people need to be able to analyze it. Whether you call it &amp;ldquo;scripting&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;macros&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;customization&amp;rdquo;, the truth is that at some point, real programming is necessary in order to truly understand and control one&amp;rsquo;s data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;after-11th-grade&#34;&gt;After 11th grade&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the story, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/25/rip-john-mccarthy-but-lisp-will-never-die/&#34;&gt;I already told earlier&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My K-12 schooling did nothing to encourage me to actually understand and apply computer science and programming. I wonder to what extent the kind of experience I had still applies today in K-12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;postscript&#34;&gt;Postscript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upcoming topics I will write about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My eye-opening experience as a teaching assistant for an undergraduate computer science course.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My current monitoring of Codecademy&amp;rsquo;s offerings and my ongoing efforts to teach my wife computer programming.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I was in my basement looking for stuff and happened to find three of my childhood &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/flute/&#34;&gt;flute&lt;/a&gt; books:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Belwin-Band-Builder-Part-Flute/dp/B000M0CLSW&#34;&gt;Belwin Band Builder part 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Rubank-Intermediate-Method-Piccolo-Educational/dp/1423444221&#34;&gt;Rubank Intermediate Method: Flute or Piccolo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Marcel-Franks-Classical-Tunes-Flute/dp/B002JVQCWI&#34;&gt;Marcel Frank&amp;rsquo;s 95 Classical Tunes For The Flute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my memories of my usage of these books and how I might use them now, three decades later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;belwin-band-builder&#34;&gt;Belwin Band Builder&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Belwin Band Builder is a completely trivial and boring beginning band method that I used when learning flute in the 5th grade under Mr. Peters. The amusing thing is the &amp;ldquo;home practice record&amp;rdquo; at the back of the book, which still has my father&amp;rsquo;s signatures, as you can see from the photo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, my memory in my &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/11/09/taking-up-flute-again-after-decades/&#34;&gt;blog post about starting flute up again&lt;/a&gt; of being delinquent with practice has been completely validated! There are a lot of &amp;ldquo;0 minutes&amp;rdquo; written down, on days when I didn&amp;rsquo;t even touch the flute and couldn&amp;rsquo;t even get myself to write down an exaggerated number of minutes of practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that only the first six weeks were graded by Mr. Peters, and in the first week, I had gotten a B- that I had tried to erase. At some point, Mr. Peters&amp;rsquo; health problems got bad, I think, and he stopped paying attention to our practice record. My father did keep on signing, for sixteen weeks, and I put down three final weeks that I didn&amp;rsquo;t even have him sign, because Mr. Peters wasn&amp;rsquo;t checking anything any more anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;rubank-intermediate-method&#34;&gt;Rubank Intermediate Method&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I recall correctly, Mr. Peters started teaching 6th grade band when he suddenly got so ill he had to retire, and our subsitute Mr. McLaughlin became permanent band director (I had him for the rest of 6th grade band and in intermediate band after that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Mr. Peters left, he gave me a list of two flute method books he recommended, and I dutifully gave the list to my father, who ordered them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that I never used them. I may have glanced at them, and fooled around a few minutes with them, but I never used them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rubank Intermediate Method was one of these books. Despite the physical age of my copy, the only evidence that I ever touched it is my name crudely written in marker on the front cover. I just started using the method and had to bend back on stapled binding so that the book would open flat for my music stand! The method looks useful to me now, with lots of technical exercises for all keys, interspersed with some musical excerpts such as gavottes and minuets, but back when I was eleven years old and not a classical music fan, this book must have seemed to me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;foreign&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pointless&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that age, I was mostly interested in playing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;marches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;syncopated rock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;big band swing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;marcel-frank-s-95-classical-tunes-for-the-flute&#34;&gt;Marcel Frank&amp;rsquo;s 95 Classical Tunes For The Flute&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all classical stuff. Enough said: my eleven-year-old self did not find much of this music interesting. There are exceptions, however! Flipping through this book, I recognize some excerpts as music I definitely tried playing at the time. Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Song of India&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleeping Beauty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roses from the South&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Radetzky March&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My explanation is quite simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I loved &lt;em&gt;marches&lt;/em&gt; of any kind (hence my later joining marching band).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I loved fast &lt;em&gt;waltzes&lt;/em&gt;, through exposure to them from TV cartoons such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_and_Jerry&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tom and Jerry&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were pieces I &lt;em&gt;recognized&lt;/em&gt; as having heard (such as &amp;ldquo;A Song of India&amp;rdquo;) because of random &amp;ldquo;Greatest Classical Masterpieces&amp;rdquo; types of LP records (and there were many varieties of this kind of material) that my mother sometimes bought at garage sales and flea markets and brought home. Being familiar with a tune (and liking it) definitely was a motivation to at least try playing it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I do not particularly like the selections or length (each just a single page) in this compilation. So I don&amp;rsquo;t expect to use this book much. I have other flute music already I have been enjoying practicing, especially the music that comes with a good accompaniment CD (this makes such a big difference).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-reflections&#34;&gt;My reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s funny to me that even now, thirty years later, my mind still operates in a similar way. I still like marches. I still like fast waltzes (and even originally took up &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/ballroom-dance/&#34;&gt;ballroom dance&lt;/a&gt; specifically because I wanted to eventually dance the Viennese waltz. I still am more motivated to play something new if I&amp;rsquo;ve heard it before and like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;rsquo;m also more mature now, more open. I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to a whole lot more and whole lot more variety of music since I was a child. And I&amp;rsquo;m willing to try listening to or playing any kind of music now. In fact, just last year, most of the music I&amp;rsquo;ve played on any instrument has been completely new to me, as a listener or performer. And that&amp;rsquo;s great. It&amp;rsquo;s part of the whole fun of living, experiencing more and different music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was amusing rediscovering my old flute books. The intermediate method looks like a good one to use for practice. It&amp;rsquo;s never too late to continue where I left off as a child, with a different mindset and more mature self-discipline!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin&amp;#39;s flute&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Tonight, on a whim, I decided to try out my flute yet again.  Every couple of months for several years now I have pulled it out to see if I might want to start playing it again.  Each time, I encountered serious problems with producing a decent sound at all, and thought that maybe I wasn&amp;rsquo;t meant to play the flute, because the embouchure is such a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, for the first time in several years, I found that maybe I can get back into playing flute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This possibility pleases me, because the story of me and flutes goes back decades, and is actually rather sad but perhaps instructive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;elementary-school&#34;&gt;Elementary school&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story starts in the last year of elementary school, 5th grade, when a bunch of us students were given the opportunity to choose and start playing a musical instrument. I can still remember Mr. Peters, the music teacher, asking each of us individually what we wanted to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this time in my life (ten years old), I had received minimal musical instruction so far. I did not grow up in a sufficiently privileged family to receive formal musical lessons, and in fact had never even touched or seen in real life any other musical instrument than the upright piano we just got at home because my mother and younger sister wanted one. I did not listen to any music, had never gone to any kind of musical concert or event before, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d asked my mother earlier what I should ask Mr. Peters to play, so I was ready to answer him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I timidly asked, &amp;ldquo;Piano?&amp;rdquo; Mr. Peters smiled and said, no, that&amp;rsquo;s not something available in the music program. I then asked, &amp;ldquo;Violin?&amp;rdquo; Again, no. I was getting really embarrassed now, because I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know what a violin was: I&amp;rsquo;d never heard one or seen one, but it was a word planted in my head by my mother! (Only many years later did I find out that all Asian kids are supposed to play piano or violin.) Finally, I said, &amp;ldquo;Flute?&amp;rdquo; Yes, flute was an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s how I started out on flute. I had never encountered a flute before. It was just a word to me. To this day I don&amp;rsquo;t know why my mother had this instrument in her mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;renting-an-instrument&#34;&gt;Renting an instrument&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of my classmates and I ended up renting instruments through the school. My father was not at all interested in my playing music and only because my mother thought I should learn a musical instrument did he cough up the cash to rent a flute for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t particularly like the flute, but I did enjoy getting started playing it. Mostly, I enjoyed the new social group I had: those of use who started on an instrument would gather and learn to play together. That was new to me, and fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;practice&#34;&gt;Practice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I did not like practicing. I &lt;em&gt;hated&lt;/em&gt; it. Worse, we were given time sheets to fill out indicating how much time we spent practicing at home every day, and have that signed by our parents as witnesses. Well, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t practicing enough, and got scolded by Mr. Peters. I started lying or padding my estimate of how much time I practiced (I still remember writing in &amp;ldquo;30&amp;rdquo; for minutes practiced inside little boxes). What did my father know anyway about what happened when I supposed got started practicing at home and then ended half an hour later?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;middle-school&#34;&gt;Middle school&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When middle school began, I took 6th grade band. Band ended up being the basis of my social life as it was. I still wasn&amp;rsquo;t really practicing flute. Furthermore, I had come to &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; flute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;bad-instrument&#34;&gt;Bad instrument&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that happened was that flute rental was over, and I had my father buy me a flute. Of course, he bought a totally beat up piece of crap from some garage sale or something somewhere. It was a horrible instrument. The pads got sticky, the mouthpiece was bent, and it was just no fun to play, it was hard to make a good sound out of it, and I knew it was a lot worse than my elementary school rental.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used that flute for another two years before I stopped playing it, forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;girly-instrument&#34;&gt;Girly instrument&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that happened was that most of the other kids playing flute was girls. Oops, I had ended up with a girly instrument! This was not a trivial matter, given that puberty was starting to kick in, along with a lot of social awareness and anxiety that I never had in elementary school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-instrument-i-really-wanted-to-play&#34;&gt;The instrument I really wanted to play&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, finally being exposed to a whole bunch of different instruments, hearing them, especially hearing the really good kids, I realized that I really wanted to play the cornet (from which there was a clear path to trumpet).  I liked that the cornet/trumpet was prominent, loud, got the main melodies, everyone could hear it (not always the case with the flute parts!), and of course, it was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; girly (although, interestingly, a number of girls did play it and were really good at it, and I had a crush on all of them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I knew there was no chance my parents would allow me to switch to trumpet. So all I did was dream about playing trumpet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I played flute in the 6th grade, and then in the 7th grade.  I played without &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; enjoyment of the flute during those two years. I did enjoy the social bonding from band, but that was basically it. Also, playing in band allowed one to place out of physical education (don&amp;rsquo;t ask me why), and I dreaded gym class, so I stuck to music to get out of gym (a big mistake, in retrospect).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;high-school&#34;&gt;High school&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;9th-grade&#34;&gt;9th grade&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I skipped the 8th grade of middle school (for reasons beyond the scope of this blog post), and started the 9th grade of high school. Again, I took band in order to avoid gym. It was a miserable experience. Not only did I have to wake up super early to have my mother drive me to marching band practice at 5 AM before school classes started at 7 AM, but also, as a young 9th grader I felt particularly out of place among students who were as much as four years older than me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall the 9th grade was a miserable part of my life, and band was just one part of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;10th-grade-through-12th-grade&#34;&gt;10th grade through 12th grade&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the 9th grade, because I threatened to drop out of school, the family moved to a different city and a different school after that, and I started 10th grade in a 10-12 high school.  Because of my miserable experiences with flute and with band, and the fact that there was no longer a gym exception for being in band, it never even occurred to me to look into joining a band at the new high school. Of course, that was perfectly OK with my father, who never liked my wasting my time on music anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This high school also had an orchestra, which I knew nothing about other than that it existed (remember, I had still never seen a violin in real life, upon reaching high school).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of high school was another miserable part of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;college&#34;&gt;College&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fell in love with music all over again in college, because of a kind of accident. There was a requirement to take courses from a &amp;ldquo;core curriculum&amp;rdquo;, and first semester of freshman year, I randomly signed up for &amp;ldquo;Piano Music of the 19th Century&amp;rdquo;. It was a great class. Combined with making new friends who listened to classical music, I started listening to a lot of music. I also started trying to teach myself piano. In retrospect, I should have tried to get real instruction, but I knew that there was no parental support for my &amp;ldquo;wasting my life&amp;rdquo; on a new musical hobby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;buying-a-new-flute&#34;&gt;Buying a new flute&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another decade or so after college, I got the idea that maybe I should try out flute again! After all, the adolescent days of thinking it was &amp;ldquo;girly&amp;rdquo; were over. The flute has still never been my favorite instrument to listen to, but I already had a head start on it, and various other instruments are more expensive to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I bought a brand new flute (the one pictured in this blog post). Unfortunately, I kept on having a hard time making decent sounds on it, until tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;trumpet&#34;&gt;Trumpet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I had the wild idea of finally realizing my childhood dream and learning trumpet. I bought a trumpet. I started practicing, but realized a couple of things.  One was that it is a &lt;em&gt;very loud&lt;/em&gt; instrument. I have neighbors and stuff. I got a mute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More seriously, I found the pressure on my lips unpleasant, and the pressure in general gave me a headache. Reluctantly, I concluded that it was not healthy for me to really play the trumpet, and put it aside. Recently, I &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/01/run-shadyside-5k-outrunning-mickey-mouse-and-lending-a-trumpet/&#34;&gt;lent&lt;/a&gt; it to someone who is hopefully making more use of the instrument than I was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-future&#34;&gt;The future&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding taking up the flute again as a result of tonight: I already started playing a new musical instrument this year, the &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/recorder/&#34;&gt;recorder&lt;/a&gt;, and I already spend an average of an hour a day practicing it.  (I also got started on &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/accordion/&#34;&gt;accordion&lt;/a&gt;, but have not had time so far to continue with it.) So it&amp;rsquo;s unclear to me how much I can devote to restarting the flute. I&amp;rsquo;d like to spend some time at least messing around in order to evaluate whether it&amp;rsquo;s worth restarting. One nice thing about the flute is that it is very versatile and if I were to get competent at playing it, I could play it in more contexts than I can currently play the recorder in. I enjoy the recorder, but it has various limitations as an instrument (which is why in Bach&amp;rsquo;s time the Baroque flute came to replace the use of the recorder, and then the modern flute was invented).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Joys of Convict Conditioning: Bodyweight Exercising</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent the vast majority of my life completely, utterly sedentary. Let&amp;rsquo;s put it this way: I was on the phone with my father yesterday and he said he went to some free senior citizen fitness program in a mall and ended up getting sweaty, and seemed concerned. I said, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m glad you got some good exercise!&amp;rdquo; In other words, I was raised to never get sweaty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when I neared age 30, and was getting heavier and heavier, and almost certainly going &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediabetes&#34;&gt;prediabetic&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to completely change my life. I took up &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/running/&#34;&gt;running&lt;/a&gt;, karate, dancing, and weight lifting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I always ended up having trouble with was weight lifting. I&amp;rsquo;d go to the gym and mess around with the machines since they were there, but although I built up some muscle, the whole process was boring, I never felt like I was really accomplishing anything, and I felt out of whack. It took years of trial and error to come to some sort of strength training regimen that I actually enjoyed and felt really benefited me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably my first step out of the confusing world of strength training was the book &lt;a href=&#34;http://store.coreperformance.com/store/Products/Core-Performance-Book__AP-BOOK.aspx&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Core Performance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I still find the advice and exercises from the book tremendously useful, and highly recommend checking out the tips and videos free at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.coreperformance.com/&#34;&gt;Core Performance web site&lt;/a&gt;. (I will blog more about Core Performance in the future.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I found that when pressed for time, I would not necessarily be in the mood to get to my balance ball and free weights and do exactly what was in Core Performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I gravitated toward a whole philosophy of &amp;ldquo;exercise anywhere, anytime, with no equipment necessary&amp;rdquo; that removes all excuses and mental friction. Welcome to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dragondoor.com/shop-by-department/books/b41/&#34;&gt;convict conditioning&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-goals&#34;&gt;My goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let&amp;rsquo;s get straight what my goals are when it comes to strength training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not a goal&lt;/strong&gt;: getting big muscles, getting ripped. I&amp;rsquo;m a bit surprised by how many of my male friends are obsessed with getting ripped. A while ago I saw an interesting article discussing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.freakonomics.com/2011/07/27/culture-bound-syndromes-run-amok/&#34;&gt;this obsession&lt;/a&gt;. Anyway, I have no goal of getting ripped (maybe because of my Asian cultural heritage, as suggested in the article), plus it is not possible for me anyway without steroids or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal&lt;/strong&gt;: to feel fit, feel strong, and &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; strong: i.e., so I can do reasonable things like lift and throw and punch and break a fall, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-convict-conditioning&#34;&gt;What is convict conditioning?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Convict conditioning basically refers to what one can do if, say, one were in jail and had no access to any particular equipment and wanted to get functionally strong, to do what is necessary to survive in such an environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, I don&amp;rsquo;t plan on being in such a grim survival environment, but I like the minimalist idea of making do with what one has, and not being dependent on any gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I found that once I started trying to really do pushups, pullups, and squats, they are &lt;em&gt;amazingly hard&lt;/em&gt;. I mean, it&amp;rsquo;s one thing just mechanically choosing weights at a gym and going through fixed motions with them, but it&amp;rsquo;s another thing being faced with your own body weight and realizing that you are naked, asking, &amp;ldquo;What can I do with my very body?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate to sound mystical or something, but it&amp;rsquo;s like the distinction between subject and object blurs, and also the whole &amp;ldquo;isolating muscles&amp;rdquo; mentality disappears (which Core Performance started me on the path out of). I believe our bodies and minds are whole, and should work entirely in concert, not in isolation. So taking up bodyweight exercises seriously is, in the end, even a philosophical statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not saying that we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t also take advantage of machines and gadgets (in fact, I still find balance balls, medicine balls, rowing machines, etc. to be useful). I&amp;rsquo;m just saying that I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; enjoy exercise when away from all that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-detour-concerning-inactivity-and-exercise&#34;&gt;A detour concerning inactivity and exercise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve come to believe that it is totally unnatural to compartmentalize one&amp;rsquo;s life the way I once did: sitting down working much of the day and then allocating some discrete block of time for exercise in some special location (home or gym).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.timferriss.com/&#34;&gt;Tim Ferriss&lt;/a&gt; and his long-running &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; and his recent book &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fourhourbody.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 4-Hour Body&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as well as sources from the whole broad &lt;a href=&#34;http://robbwolf.com/&#34;&gt;paleo&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.marksdailyapple.com/&#34;&gt;primal&lt;/a&gt; diet and lifestyle, and hearing about the research showing how bad it is to be &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.geekosystem.com/sitting-health-dangers/&#34;&gt;sitting&lt;/a&gt; for an extended period at all, I&amp;rsquo;ve made sure to take frequent breaks away from my computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When taking a break, I might just walk to get some water or stretch, but now that I know of the benefits of intermittent sprints of intense activity, convict conditioning becomes even more relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;practical-advantages-of-bodyweight-exercising&#34;&gt;Practical advantages of bodyweight exercising&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a practical point of view, pushups, pullups, and squats are great because I can do them almost anywhere, anytime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will often just get down on the floor at work or at home, and do various forms of pushups, or squats. That gets the blood flowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pullups are trickier, because although I have tried doing them by grasping onto the top of my office door frame at work, it&amp;rsquo;s painful and unreliable.  However, at home, I have on the frame of one entryway a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.doorgym.net/&#34;&gt;Door Gym&lt;/a&gt; pullup bar, which I use at random times when passing through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, bodyweight exercising comes in handy also when traveling, or attending some all-day conference or other such event. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to go hide somewhere momentarily and do a bunch of pushups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I have found in the past year that just doing a few seconds of intense activity to boost my metabolism before eating has a noticeable effect in decreasing my fat percentage. This stuff works!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;progress&#34;&gt;Progress&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pullups have always been really hard for me, but as of today, to my surprise, I&amp;rsquo;m finally up to eight reps from a dead hang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still am nowhere near doing a single one-arm pullup or pushup. I love a challenge. We&amp;rsquo;ll see when I get there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
