&lt;p&gt;I learned that &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheo_Feliciano&#34;&gt;Cheo Feliciano&lt;/a&gt; just &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/17/showbiz/cheo-feliciano-obit/&#34;&gt;died in a car accident at age 78&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-i-have-been-a-fan-of-cheo-feliciano&#34;&gt;Why I have been a fan of Cheo Feliciano&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Born in Puerto Rico, he was one of my favorite singers of salsa and bolero when I was regularly doing Latin dancing and seeking out the best music out there. As a particular fan of bolero, I was drawn to his magnetic voice and style: rich, smooth, flexible. His singing always seemed so resonant and never harsh; in particular, as a learner of Spanish, I appreciated how easy it was to hear his words, because of his clear, conversational articulation even as he sang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check him out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-favorite-musical-selections&#34;&gt;Some favorite musical selections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My single favorite recording of his is of the bolero (you know how I love bolero) &amp;ldquo;Delirio&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/M4Unt7OwkJc&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was fantastic at uptempo salsa too, of course. Here is a video of him performing &amp;ldquo;Busca lo Tuyo&amp;rdquo;. I particularly like his &lt;em&gt;improvisation&lt;/em&gt; in salsa: he sounds so natural while inventive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/erddzOK3Eys&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you love classic salsa and bolero, take some time out to review his old albums and remember how great he was. And remember to keep dancing to his fine music!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you feel when you learn that a favorite musician of yours has died? Do you do anything to celebrate his or her life and contribution to yours? I like to reflect on what I found so special that touched my life, and share that so that others will remember, or learn anew.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
