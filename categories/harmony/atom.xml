      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I enjoyed yet another monthly meeting of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/lukas/pcars/Welcome.html&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh chapter of the American Recorder Society&lt;/a&gt;. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been talking much about playing recorder, because I&amp;rsquo;ve been focused almost entirely on flute in my own practice, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been faithfully attending the monthly meetings of the recorder society, because I very much enjoy playing in an ensemble and continuing to learn to be a more aware and sensitive ensemble musician.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we were packing up, Fred and Mike spontaneously started sight reading a movement from Telemann&amp;rsquo;s Sonata No. 6 in G major for two recorders, Op. 2, TWV 40:106.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was so struck by the qualities of their playing that I aspire to reach, that I took a short video clip as a reminder to myself:&lt;/p&gt;
