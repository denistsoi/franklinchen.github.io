      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow is my birthday, and I will be running the Pittsburgh Marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea how it will turn out, because I spent the past week not knowing whether I would even make it to the start line!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s been happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;last-saturday-recovering-from-injury&#34;&gt;Last Saturday: recovering from injury&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week ago I was in despair as &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/04/27/missing-the-final-steel-city-road-runners-taper-run-because-of-injury/&#34;&gt;I skipped a planned Steel City Road Runners final taper run because of injury and burnout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sunday&#34;&gt;Sunday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continued to rest and apply cream to my foot skin cracks. My right shin is OK again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;monday&#34;&gt;Monday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After three days off from running, I was worried about losing fitness. My feet were healing slowly. I did just a mile on the treadmill, wearing Vibram FiveFingers Bikila LS, not Luna Sandals, in order to keep my feet from drying out. I felt very sluggish and weak. I wanted to verify that I could at least run at all though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tuesday&#34;&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My right foot was hurting again, healing not complete. Also, I was feeling simply physically exhausted, like I was getting sick or something: I had a headache waking up. I took a day off work to do a lot of napping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;wednesday&#34;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought my friends who have been following my marathon training progress for the past two months should know what was up, so &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/franklin.chen/posts/10201292146683473&#34;&gt;I posted on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;If the marathon were tomorrow, I would not go to the start line. I hope another three days of healing will get me there.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later I did feel better and get in a short 1-mile run, in Luna Sandals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started carb-loading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;thursday&#34;&gt;Thursday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt better, my feet were mostly healed, and I got in a 2-mile run. I publicly declared &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/franklin.chen/posts/10201298432760621&#34;&gt;on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m on for the marathon on Sunday!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the day, in a freak accident, unfortunately, I fell down the stairs at work. Basically, I missed one step when taking a step with my left foot. I ended up landing really hard and awkwardly on my left foot on the second step down instead of the first step down, with considerable pressure on my left knee, which buckled to the side a bit, and then I landed on my right foot, with less pressure on my right knee, then I fell to the right and banged up my right ankle also. I was surprised that I didn&amp;rsquo;t actually break anything, but I was shaken. I tried to joke about this &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/franklin.chen/posts/10201299844715919&#34;&gt;on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, but the incident did not help me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;friday&#34;&gt;Friday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tired. No running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;saturday-today&#34;&gt;Saturday (today)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woke up exhausted, spent the whole day napping. Finished carb-loading. I gained about three pounds in the past three days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve done what I could in order to make it to the start line of the Pittsburgh Marathon tomorrow. Everything is out of whack, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to cancel doing it, or switch to doing the half marathon. I haven&amp;rsquo;t had a real run in &lt;em&gt;nine days&lt;/em&gt;. I regret completely messing up my preparation for the marathon, but as long as I think I can finish it, I am doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may not be quite logical, but emotionally, in the past week, I have felt that I need to do the marathon, not so much because I have done so much for it (OK, that&amp;rsquo;s the sunk cost fallacy, I know), but because I signed up for it with an agreement with Abby that this was going to be my last marathon for 15-20 years, and lately, in light of my suffering (and her collateral suffering), I amended that to tell her that I was never going to do a marathon again, ever!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Missing the final Steel City Road Runners taper run because of injury and burnout</title>

      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/04/27/missing-the-final-steel-city-road-runners-taper-run-because-of-injury/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/04/25/back-from-injury-an-unexpected-fast-finish-steel-city-road-runners-training-run/&#34;&gt;Two days ago, I reported on coming back from injury and doing a Steel City Road Runners evening training run&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that the unexpected fast pace that I &lt;em&gt;stupidly&lt;/em&gt; went along with took its toll on me. I am now in &lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt; trouble with just one more week to go before the Pittsburgh Marathon. This morning I did not at all feel like running, and so I skipped attending the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.steelcityrrc.org/scrrcevents?eventId=619967&amp;amp;EventViewMode=2&amp;amp;CalendarViewType=1&amp;amp;SelectedDate=4/6/2013&#34;&gt;final (and 6 mile) Steel City Road Runners Saturday morning run that I had so looked forward to all these months&lt;/a&gt;!! I take these Saturday training runs seriously and have really enjoyed them, writing about each one that I participate in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I do not know whether I will be able to even go to the start line of the marathon in a week.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;injury-and-burnout&#34;&gt;Injury and burnout&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of yesterday, I simply felt tired and sore. I&amp;rsquo;ve been battling burnout on marathon training for some time now, basically since my &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/04/13/my-final-16-mile-long-run-before-pittsburgh-marathon-featured-two-radical-experiments/&#34;&gt;16-mile long run of two weeks ago&lt;/a&gt;, which was the last time I felt really strong and stable. The last &lt;em&gt;two weeks&lt;/em&gt; have been very worrisome to me, as I&amp;rsquo;ve reported on overtraining and injury &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/04/19/going-out-too-fast-yet-again-in-my-third-random-distance-run/&#34;&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/04/20/on-overtraining-and-feeling-injured-two-weeks-before-the-pittsburgh-marathon/&#34;&gt;times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My legs are hurting. My left &lt;em&gt;knee&lt;/em&gt; is a little weird, my right &lt;em&gt;shin&lt;/em&gt; is hurting (I have not had shin splints all year so far!), I&amp;rsquo;ve been waking up with tightness and pain under my left foot (plantar fascia?). These are serious problems, not run-of-the-mill training soreness. It feels like I&amp;rsquo;ve run my body into the ground. It&amp;rsquo;s such a shame, because I was feeling so great two weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst physical problem is my &lt;em&gt;skin&lt;/em&gt;! My dry cracking skin on my right foot has gotten worse. The crack at the big toe has reopened. A new crack has formed near the ball of my foot. I cannot put pressure on this foot without extreme pain. I also have a crack near the heel of my left foot that had been healing earlier but now is bothering me as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-now&#34;&gt;What now?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I can do is rest and hope to get back my energy, and also fix my skin problems. I am soaking my feet and rubbing off dry skin and rubbing on foot cream in order to try to heal the cracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was really stupid of me to have deviated from my tapering plans two days ago and run much faster than I should have, given that I was just coming back from injury. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t on my schedule to do such a thing. Now I&amp;rsquo;m in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Back from injury: an unexpected fast finish Steel City Road Runners training run</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/04/20/on-overtraining-and-feeling-injured-two-weeks-before-the-pittsburgh-marathon/&#34;&gt;Five days ago, I reported on feeling overtrained and injured.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I report on my progress with recovery and continued training for the Pittsburgh Marathon during the first week of my taper period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;recovery&#34;&gt;Recovery&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that I&amp;rsquo;m bouncing back. I still have a way to go before I feel completely healthy and strong, but I&amp;rsquo;m not doing too badly, considering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;knee&#34;&gt;Knee&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, I did take Sunday off from running (and from wearing Luna Sandals). My left knee was still shaky on Monday, plus I simply felt tired, so I took Monday off as well. Tuesday, my knee was feeling better, so I did an easy 3.5 mile run and called it a day. That really improved my mood, because I was really upset about whether I could run the marathon at all. Wednesday, my knee seemed completely OK, so I ran an easy 4.5 miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;feet&#34;&gt;Feet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My left foot skin injuries are healing; two days ago there was still some rawness:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/left-foot-healing.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Left foot healing&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But today, everything is completely scabbed over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My right foot is still problematic with a crack in the dry skin at the big toe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, I have been back to wearing Luna Sandals since two days ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;new-shorts&#34;&gt;New shorts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All my runs this week have been in a new pair of running shorts that I will probably use for the marathon. I bought this at Elite Runners and Walkers a month ago when picking up my race packet for the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/03/30/report-on-just-a-short-run-my-first-half-marathon-in-nine-years/&#34;&gt;Just A Short Run half marathon&lt;/a&gt; there, but hadn&amp;rsquo;t gotten around to wearing them yet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am liking this &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.brooksrunning.com/Infiniti-Short-III/210277,default,pd.html&#34;&gt;Brooks Infiniti Short III&lt;/a&gt; a lot. It seems extremely well-designed. I have not sensed chafing problems, and the pockets for a key and gel seem sturdy. Believe me, I have had all kinds of problems with many running shorts in the past decade, mostly involving chafing, deterioration of materials, and pockets becoming non-functional because of how they are sewn, so I can spot design and quality problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-run&#34;&gt;The run&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I wanted to do a marathon pace (9-minute pace) run of no more than 6 miles. It turned out that Steel City Road Runners along with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.truerunner.com/&#34;&gt;True Runner&lt;/a&gt; had organized a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.steelcityrrc.org/events?eventId=675354&amp;amp;EventViewMode=EventDetails&#34;&gt;Thursday evening 6-mile training run&lt;/a&gt;. I almost never run in the evening, but just this once, I decided to check it out, and John joined me also, for our first run together since the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/03/09/11-pittsburgh-bridge-crossings-in-one-12-mile-run/&#34;&gt;12-miler that put him out of commission almost two months ago and led him to cancel his Pittsburgh Marathon registration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was pretty cold, relatively speaking. The temperature was around 50 and getting colder, windier, and it was cloudy and it looked like it might rain (it turned out that near the end of the run, it did drizzle a bit).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;pace&#34;&gt;Pace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We followed a guy who was supposed to lead a roughly 9-minute pace for 6 miles, doing two 3-mile loops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My impression was that we shot out noticeably faster, and I fell off the pack and just tried to stay in contact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-note-on-dense-urban-evening-running&#34;&gt;A note on dense urban evening running&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running in the Shadyside area at this time of day is stressful, it turns out, because of all the road traffic, the narrow sidewalks, and stop lights. We had to stop more often than I prefer:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/shadyside-run-stopped.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Waiting for light in Shadyside run&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well, this was a learning experience, reminding me of why I prefer to run in the morning, and in less congested areas such as Beechwood Boulevard or Homewood Cemetery in Squirrel Hill, or Frick or Schenley Park!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;first-loop&#34;&gt;First loop&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite going slower than everyone else in the supposedly 9-minute pace group, I was feeling pretty good, probably finally completely recovered from last week&amp;rsquo;s overtraining. My stride rate was fast and I felt relatively relaxed and efficient, except that I knew we were going faster than I feel I will be able to sustain in the marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw a guy in front of me wearing calf sleeves. I had forgotten to wear mine. I should wear them more before the marathon in order to make sure to be completely used to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finished the first loop in around 26:18. Um, that&amp;rsquo;s 8:47 pace. I was right, we were going faster than 9:00 pace. I had in fact wondered why our pacer had slowed down some blocks before we got back to True Runner, and meanwhile most of the rest of us just followed whoever was in front of the pack!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;second-loop&#34;&gt;Second loop&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people stopped to drink Gatorade or water, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t take any. Then we headed off again. This time, the pace was slower, possibly even a bit slower than 9:00 pace. That was fine with me. But after about a mile, we started going faster and faster. I almost had to laugh. We were going considerably faster than in the first loop even.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pacer eventually fell back and &lt;em&gt;we all just passed him&lt;/em&gt;. Later I reflected on this bizarre group mentality we engaged in. We must have simply ended up following whoever wanted to go fastest. I decided I might as well treat this run as a super fast finish run rather than the steady run I had originally intended. We were clearly going at 8:30 pace and then even faster, down to 8:00 pace and even possibly 7:45 by the end. It was crazy. I felt like I was running in a race. For some reason, everyone decided to push it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finished the second loop in something like 24:59 (we&amp;rsquo;d done the first loop in 26:18).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That I was able to maintain alert turnover and also speed things up as I felt like it gave me some confidence that I am bouncing back OK from the past two really hard weeks of training. I have one more week of tapering to go before the marathon!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On overtraining and feeling injured two weeks before the Pittsburgh Marathon</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/04/13/my-final-16-mile-long-run-before-pittsburgh-marathon-featured-two-radical-experiments/&#34;&gt;Last week&amp;rsquo;s 16-mile run with the Steel City Road Runners&lt;/a&gt; was my longest run during the past two months of training for the Pittsburgh Marathon. I knew that it was about time to start &lt;a href=&#34;http://running.competitor.com/2012/08/training/the-art-of-the-marathon-taper_57754&#34;&gt;tapering&lt;/a&gt;, but I felt that because of my relatively low mileage (mostly under 30 miles a week), I should put in one last hard week of training, and then have two weeks of tapering before the marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this week I overdid things and &lt;a href=&#34;http://steelcityrrc.org/scrrcevents?eventId=619965&#34;&gt;today&amp;rsquo;s 11-mile run&lt;/a&gt; was very revealing. I ended that run with a whole slew of real problems that I need to immediately fix, or else I will not be able to even make it to the start line of the marathon in two weeks!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;this-week-s-workouts&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s workouts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;monday&#34;&gt;Monday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/04/19/commuting-on-foot-during-cmu-carnival-week-as-cross-training-for-the-pittsburgh-marathon/&#34;&gt;walking 2 miles to work&lt;/a&gt;, I did a tough &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/02/03/my-favorite-running-workout/&#34;&gt;high-intensity Billat workout&lt;/a&gt; on the CMU track, thinking that having taken Sunday off from running, I was ready to get back into action. After doing about 12 minutes of this workout (after warming up first, of course), I was beat. I was feeling pressure on my knees and shins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, I was not sufficiently recovered from my 16-miler on Saturday, and I made a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I walked 2 miles back home from work, with sore legs and feet, and still wearing Luna Sandals all day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tuesday&#34;&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did an easy 6-mile run, which included 1 mile of running to work, 4 miles of running in Schenley Park on the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/09/07/running-my-8th-pretty-good-race-5k-dealing-with-disappointment/&#34;&gt;Pretty Good Race course&lt;/a&gt;, and 1 mile on the CMU track. Despite taking this run slowly, I felt rather sore afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;wednesday&#34;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to take a day completely off from running, and off from Luna Sandals, to give my legs and feet a rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;thursday&#34;&gt;Thursday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran 5 miles in Frick Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;friday&#34;&gt;Friday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did the annual &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/04/19/going-out-too-fast-yet-again-in-my-third-random-distance-run/&#34;&gt;Random Distance Run&lt;/a&gt;. By this time, I was quite looking forward to getting Saturday&amp;rsquo;s run over with and then resting on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;11-mile-run&#34;&gt;11-mile run&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to make the Saturday run a kind of dress rehearsal for the marathon. I would wake up at approximately the same time, and dress and eat as though running the marathon, and run at marathon pace, and the only difference would be that I would do 11 miles, not 26.2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I ate some salted, boiled potatoes for breakfast, and took a gel pack to eat right before the run, and planned to take a gel during the run also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was really cold yet again (temperature below 40F, and I saw some stray snowflakes), even colder than last week, so I substituted a short-sleeve T-shirt and shell and long pants in place of the long-sleeve T-shirt and shorts I wore last Saturday. I still had the glove liners and hat, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wore, for the first time, my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cepcompression.com/1922-Allsports-Sleeves.aspx&#34;&gt;calf sleeves&lt;/a&gt; that had just arrived, and that I plan to wear during the marathon:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;CEP Compression calf sleeves&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;moment-of-silence-for-boston&#34;&gt;Moment of silence for Boston&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole week has been very weird for me because the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/04/15/boston-marathon-tragedy-please-avoid-the-news-porn/&#34;&gt;Boston Marathon bombing on Monday has been on my mind&lt;/a&gt;; I did what I could to avoid media coverage of the hunt for the bombers. It turned out that just last night, they caught the remaining official suspect, so that brought a little closure to the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The training run was preceded by a moment of silence for Boston as well as updates on changes to the Pittsburgh Marathon setup for increased security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this run, I wore blue as well as a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.races2remember.com/PrintBib.php?bib=BOSTON2013&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;We are all Boston Marathoners at heart&amp;rdquo; bib&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;We are all Boston Marathoners at heart&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-run&#34;&gt;The run&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/scrr-2013-04-20/start.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Waiting to start run&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I intended to try to follow a 9-minute pace group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that the group went out pretty fast. I could not tell whether it felt fast because it really &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; faster than 9-minute pace, or because I was so fatigued from my week of training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point, I did speed up (as I usually seem to do in my runs, starting out slowly before I&amp;rsquo;m all warmed up and ready to go faster). Then the problem was that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what the route was exactly, once I started passing people! Yes, I got the printed map right before the run, but that&amp;rsquo;s never a great time for me to study and memorize the map, and I hate pulling out the map while running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;getting-lost&#34;&gt;Getting &amp;ldquo;lost&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point when we reached downtown again in Pittsburgh, and we were supposed to eventually cross over north, I asked some runners around me what the route was, and unfortunately, one guy made some assumption and we followed him. Later I learned he made the wrong assumption. In fact, since I ran past him and was following some other people ahead of me, I got myself into more trouble. At one point, I saw someone behind me go right, while the guy ahead of me by a block kept going straight. I immediately smelled that the guy was &lt;em&gt;not part of our group&lt;/em&gt; (lots of people were out running, I could tell), and sure enough, I looked back and everyone was taking a shortcut through someone&amp;rsquo;s back yard to get back to Liberty Avenue and cross the 16th Street Bridge, and so I backtracked and followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By that time, I was tired and demoralized by all the weird twists and turns the route had become after having reached downtown earlier, and now that I knew where I was, I just slowed down and didn&amp;rsquo;t bother to catch up to any pack again, and took some photos:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/scrr-2013-04-20/bridge.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;View from Sixteenth Street Bridge&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/scrr-2013-04-20/16th-street-bridge.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Crossing Sixteenth Street Bridge&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t really know how far I ran or how fast. It just seemed really intense to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;after-the-run&#34;&gt;After the run&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/scrr-2013-04-20/after.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;After run&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After the run, I ate two bananas and some cookies and went inside to stretch and inspect the damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;feet&#34;&gt;Feet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Luna Sandals:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/scrr-2013-04-20/luna-venado.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Luna Venado&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h4 id=&#34;tops-of-feet&#34;&gt;Tops of feet&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/scrr-2013-04-20/feet.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Feet&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My right foot felt OK, despite some indentations from tight laces:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/scrr-2013-04-20/right.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Right foot&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But my left foot took a lot of damage, with skin scraped and some blood; the problem was that the strap had been loose, but I had neglected to stop and tighten and readjust it, and as a result, it shifted around and therefore chafed me:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/scrr-2013-04-20/left.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Left foot&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It was good to learn this lesson once and for all: I will be more careful in the future to make sure the laces are tight enough, and also not ignore sensations of chafing, and take the time to stop and readjust if I really have to. I could not have run a full marathon with my left foot being chafed in this fashion for the whole distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;soles-of-feet&#34;&gt;Soles of feet&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My soles revealed some developing problems from the entire week.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/scrr-2013-04-20/soles.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Soles of feet&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My left sole was basically OK, despite some dry skin that I should really deal with, but my right sole had more serious dry and cracking skin problems. In particular, near my big toe, there was a noticeable crack that caused me discomfort with every step:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/scrr-2013-04-20/right-sole.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Right sole of foot&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;calves&#34;&gt;Calves&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the calf sleeves did help me, even in just an 11-miler. They were not obtrusive at all as I wore them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;knee&#34;&gt;Knee&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the afternoon at home, I noticed that I had developed a debilitating left knee problem. I have no idea what exactly caused it, but the general overtraining had clearly caught up to me. When I put weight on my left leg at certain angles, the pain is excruciating. This particular happens when I go down the stairs. On the other hand, I can control whether I feel pain, by stepping very carefully. Something is loose and out of alignment, clearly. This has happened to me before, so I&amp;rsquo;m not as worried as I could be, but just two weeks away from the marathon, it is not good news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;recovery-plans&#34;&gt;Recovery plans?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My left knee is my highest priority right now. I am immediately taking a break from running. I will take tomorrow off, and possibly Monday as well. I will do whatever it takes to get the knee all good again, because there is no way I would even go to the start line of the marathon with the knee being as it is today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really need to fix my feet, and especially the right one. I really dried out my feet by wearing the Luna Sandals exclusively for running (and almost exclusively for walking) in the past week. So I&amp;rsquo;m putting lotion on my feet and deciding to wear socks and cushioned shoes for a while. There&amp;rsquo;s more I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to do for my feet also. I&amp;rsquo;ve never in my life had this dry skin problem before on my feet, because in the past when it&amp;rsquo;s been cold and dry, I&amp;rsquo;ve always worn socks and closed toe shoes, whether of the usual monotoed variety or Vibram FiveFingers. I&amp;rsquo;ve never had my feet so exposed before. Especially, running in temperatures of the 30s with huaraches seemed to cause some of my problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the next two weeks really are supposed to be tapering for me. I will be running easy and short and slow for the most part, just to maintain some fitness, but do not plan on doing any super hard workouts any more. We all know that the body takes about two weeks to adapt to any training, and so no hard training I do now will have an effect on my performance in the marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I yet again pushed myself to the edge and overtrained, and have some real knee and feet problems to solve as quickly as possible. I am so ready to dial down the training and get the marathon over with. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to sound pessimistic or depressed, but that&amp;rsquo;s the reality of how I&amp;rsquo;m feeling at this moment. I hope that within the next couple of days, I&amp;rsquo;ll have recovered from this low point.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My final 16-mile long run before Pittsburgh Marathon featured two radical experiments</title>

      <pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2013 21:26:37 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/04/13/my-final-16-mile-long-run-before-pittsburgh-marathon-featured-two-radical-experiments/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Pittsburgh Marathon is just three weeks away. According to some training schedules, today&amp;rsquo;s long run should be the last really long one, followed by two shorter taper runs in the next two weeks. However, because I had a late start in training, and my mileage is not all that high (I reached a &lt;em&gt;lifetime peak weekly mileage&lt;/em&gt; of &amp;ldquo;only&amp;rdquo; 36 last week, before coming back down for this week), I have not yet decided whether to do another really long run next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one thing was sure: today&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.steelcityrrc.org/scrrcevents?eventId=619966&amp;amp;EventViewMode=2&amp;amp;CalendarViewType=1&amp;amp;SelectedDate=4/14/2013&#34;&gt;16-mile run with the Steel City Road Runners&lt;/a&gt; was going to be important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used this run as an opportunity to perform two radical experiments, which succeeded beyond expectation!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/steel-valley-trail-run/trail.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Steel Valley Trail&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-route&#34;&gt;The route&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s run started at Dick&amp;rsquo;s Sporting Goods in the Waterfront and was an out-and-back on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.traillink.com/trail/steel-valley-trail---great-allegheny-passage-.aspx&#34;&gt;Steel Valley Trail&lt;/a&gt; along the Monongahela River, crossing it to McKeesport before turning back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe id=&#34;mapmyfitness_route&#34; src=&#34;http://snippets.mapmycdn.com/routes/view/embedded/191220198?width=560&amp;height=400&amp;elevation=true&amp;info=true&amp;line_color=E60f0bdb&amp;rgbhex=DB0B0E&amp;distance_markers=1&amp;unit_type=imperial&amp;map_mode=TERRAIN&amp;last_updated=2013-04-10T11:41:50-04:00&#34; height=&#34;590px&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: right; padding-right: 20px;&#34;&gt;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;http://mapmyrun.com/routes/create/&#34;&gt;Create Maps&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;http://mapmyrun.com/routes/&#34;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; from 80 million at &lt;a href=&#34;http://mapmyrun.com&#34;&gt;MapMyRun&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;experiment-one-footwear&#34;&gt;Experiment one: footwear&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was on the cold, cloudy side (temperature started off below 40F and probably never reached 50F), and rather windy, but I was dressed just enough for the conditions: a long-sleeve T-shirt, shorts, glove liners, and a hat. I felt it was particularly important to wear shorts on this long run, because I expect to be wearing (these) shorts in the Pittsburgh Marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been running exclusively in Luna Sandals since last week&amp;rsquo;s long run. I am still breaking them in, but the chafing has decreased (although the scabs are old evidence of it), and the shoes are forming to my feet. I still have a problem with heel slippage on my right foot, but hope to figure that out eventually without lacing too tight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hope has always been that I will be able to wear the Luna Sandals in the marathon itself. I have rather enjoyed running in them instead of Vibram FiveFingers, but the Luna Sandals have their own drawbacks I&amp;rsquo;m working out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;experiment-two-fuel&#34;&gt;Experiment two: fuel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I planned to do this run as a &amp;ldquo;long, steady run&amp;rdquo; rather than a &amp;ldquo;fast finish long run&amp;rdquo; as I did last week, but with a twist: deliberate &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mcmillanrunning.com/index.php/articlePages/article/2&#34;&gt;depletion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ate &lt;em&gt;no breakfast&lt;/em&gt; before the run. And I planned to &lt;em&gt;drink no Gatorade&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;eat no GU gel&lt;/em&gt; during the run, if possible. I wanted to only drink water, and see if I experience glycogen depletion, and if so, try to run through it. The marathon is a hard event. To be ready, I want to at least partially simulate what it might feel like in the second half of a marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-run&#34;&gt;The run&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had never run on the Steel Valley Trail before, so it was a new, interesting experience. Some of it is on dirt, but most of it is asphalt. I have to confess to not being a fan of smelling fumes from plants in operation, and seeing and hearing a lot of trains up close, but it was otherwise a peaceful, continuous path, and I do like running along a river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to plan, I started out slowly, paying no attention to the pace groups. (I am not going to follow any pace groups in the Pittsburgh Marathon either; all these group runs as well as the Just A Short Run half marathon have taught me that I should just follow my body&amp;rsquo;s own rhythm).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;footwear&#34;&gt;Footwear&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was wearing Luna Sandals for the longest run ever in them; the longest run I had done up till now in them was 7.5 miles, less than half of 16! Embarrassingly, for the first mile or so, I kept on stopping to readjust the laces, because of heel slippage. I finally realized that because it was under 40F, and I had just hopped out of bed, my feet were smaller than in other runs I&amp;rsquo;d done (it&amp;rsquo;s been crazy warm recently until today).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a couple of miles, I was fine in the sandals for the rest of the run!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;fuel&#34;&gt;Fuel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were two fluid stations, hence three stops (one of them being at the turnaround point). As planned, I took only water, no Gatorade. And although I carried one gel with me during the entire run, I ended up never using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;observations&#34;&gt;Observations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first observation was how &amp;ldquo;clean&amp;rdquo; I felt, mentally and physically, running without breakfast and with no fuel in my stomach. Of course, I believe that in the actual marathon I will need fuel, and I will need it regularly, in order to prepare for the final miles, but this was the &lt;em&gt;first time&lt;/em&gt; in my entire life that I had run as far as 16 miles without any prior breakfast or fuel during the run! It was confidence-boosting to me that for at least 16 miles, I could run without external aid, and just rely mainly on fat-burning rather than pumping in carbs. I did start feeling hungry in the second half of the run, and when I finished the run realized I was quite hungry, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, my feet were just fine in the Luna Sandals. Apart from starting off pretty cold, and encountering surprisingly annoying particles that got between my feet and the soles during the dirt sections of the trail, I got no blisters, chafing was minimal, and my knees and toes and hips felt, after the run, better than they had ever felt after a run of this distance. I felt a bit tight, but &lt;em&gt;not crampy yet&lt;/em&gt;. That was a pleasant surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I will keep on refining my use of the Luna Sandals, but I fully expect, after this experience, that I will run the Pittsburgh Marathon in these sandals!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of cushioning is a virtue of these minimalist sandals, I believe: being less cushioned than the Bikila LS, I can better feel if my form is poor, because then I feel jarring impact. And I can also feel when I make subtle form adjustments, which the minimal sole enable me to make at all (in the Bikila LS shoes, I feel they induce too much lateral motion sometimes). The feedback cycle enables me to refine my form constantly.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/steel-valley-trail-run/luna-sandals-feet.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Wearing Luna Sandals&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;speed&#34;&gt;Speed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I timed myself on this run, but without calculating any pace during the run itself: I only made note of the start time, turnaround time, and end time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first half, when I started really slow (and had to stop to adjust my laces), but then picked it up naturally, I ran 8 miles in 1:15, or 9:23 pace. That&amp;rsquo;s actually faster than I thought I was going. I did not want to go too fast, since this was not supposed to be a fast run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second half, I did pick it up, because I was feeling good, and decided to try to find a &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; faster pace in order to see what I might comfortably do as actual marathon pace. I finished the last 8 miles in 1:12, which is exactly 9:00 pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That translates to a marathon finish time of 3:56, which I&amp;rsquo;d be completely happy with. So I think it may be realistic after all, despite my abbreviated training season (I really wish I had an additional month, actually, to doing a couple more 16 mile runs), to aim to go under 4:00. I will decide during my final tapering week what my actual plan is for marathon day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;recovery&#34;&gt;Recovery&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went home and immediately slurped down a planned snack, before eating more food. My first snack was potatoes I had boiled earlier, along with some garlic salt:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/steel-valley-trail-run/potatoes.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Boiled potatoes with garlic salt&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Boiled potatoes go down really well for me. That gives me an idea: on marathon day I will carb-load with potatoes for breakfast, and maybe even bring a potato to the start line to eat before the gun goes off. Despite my fuel-less experiment succeeding for 16 miles, I have every intention of somehow packing in the fuel before marathon day. I need to figure out a plan to top off the fuel without upsetting my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I had lower total mileage than last week; I&amp;rsquo;m down from 36 to 31. I hope to ramp it back up for the coming training week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My two experiments during the 16-mile run gave me increased confidence in my footwear and fueling plans and robustness. I will continue to do some fasting, fuel-less runs as well as wear the Luna Sandals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A comeback from Pittsburgh Marathon overtraining</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/04/06/comeback-from-pittsburgh-marathon-overtraining/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 06 Apr 2013 15:59:23 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/04/06/comeback-from-pittsburgh-marathon-overtraining/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I reported on running Just A Short Run, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/03/30/report-on-just-a-short-run-my-first-half-marathon-in-nine-years/&#34;&gt;my first half marathon in nine years&lt;/a&gt;. One very real concern I had &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/03/03/my-first-steel-city-road-runners-winter-5k-race/&#34;&gt;when I put this race on my calendar a month ago&lt;/a&gt; was that recovery from it might interfere with my marathon training. Although I did not race Just A Short Run all out, I did put in a hard effort, and sure enough I did end up having a really tough training week afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the overtraining this week was partly my doing. Here I explain how I ended up feeling like I was falling apart, and how I recovered and felt pretty good during today&amp;rsquo;s long run.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/wow-run.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Pittsburgh Marathon Warmup on Walnut run&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;after-the-half-marathon&#34;&gt;After the half marathon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in my report, I had some issues after the race: my right lower calf/Achilles area seized up for a bit, and also my right second and third toes did as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, a day later, I was feeling very sore in my right lower calf and second toe. I should mention that I have &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morton%27s_toe&#34;&gt;Morton&amp;rsquo;s toe&lt;/a&gt; on both feet, although my left second toe is only barely longer than the big toe, while it is my right second toe that is noticeably longer than the big toe and therefore has a real tendency to cause me some problems:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/mortons-toe.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;My Morton&amp;#39;s toes&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So I did take a day off running after the half marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;monday-trying-to-be-careful&#34;&gt;Monday: trying to be careful&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even on Monday, I was still feeling sore. I decided that I should do some light running anyway, to avoid two days off completely from running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I very much wanted to finally start running in my new Luna Sandals, which I had received last week but put aside because of the half marathon. These are the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lunasandals.com/products/33-venado&#34;&gt;Venado with ATS laces and MGT footbed&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://s3.amazonaws.com/lunastore/images/255/full.jpg?1351720427&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Luna Sandals: Venado, ATS laces, MGT footbed&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I ended up running just an easy 2 miles on the treadmill in the morning in my Vibram FiveFingers Bikila LS shoes, and then after work, running 1.5 miles in the Luna Sandals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tuesday-new-shoes&#34;&gt;Tuesday: new shoes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, I was still not yet completely recovered either from the half marathon, but I felt I was ready to go for a normal run. I decided to do a real run in the Luna Sandals and did 5 miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encountered various problems while trying out the Luna Sandals, beginning to break them in. I got chafed in various places from the straps and buckle:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/luna-sandals-2013-04-02/feet.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Feet chafed&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/luna-sandals-2013-04-02/side.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Side view&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/luna-sandals-2013-04-02/wearing.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Feet in&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/luna-sandals-2013-04-02/heel.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;View of heel&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And it was tricky keeping the sandals on at all. I fidgeted a lot with the laces to try to keep my heels from slipping. I kept on having problems with my right heel slipping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, although my calf was healing up, I was more worried about my right second toe, which seemed sore and sensitive. I noticed that my tendency to impact the second toe (after all, it is my longest toe) was causing trouble. I had not really encountered any problems until after the half marathon, but the intensity of that effort, and the fact that my Bikila LS shoes were getting worn down at the toes, must have exposed this biomechanical weakness finally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;wednesday-overexcited&#34;&gt;Wednesday: overexcited&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday, I was excited about running, and used the Luna Sandals again. I still had slippage and chafing issues, but figured that there was a break-in process. The soles were starting to shape to my feet, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I accidentally (because of taking impromptu routes in Homewood Cemetery) ran 9 miles when I had originally intended to run more like 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second toe was startling to tingle and really complain: even normal walking triggered pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;thursday-admission-of-overtraining&#34;&gt;Thursday: admission of overtraining&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday was one of those days when I truly &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/01/14/three-questions-to-ask-yourself-when-you-dont-feel-like-doing-your-scheduled-workout/&#34;&gt;had to ask myself three questions&lt;/a&gt;. I was simply feeling &lt;em&gt;exhausted&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I forced myself to completely take Thursday off from running (or strength training, for that matter), while evaluating my situation. This was no longer just about my toe, but about my overall fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I had to fix this toe problem somehow, and soon, because I had a long run planned for Saturday. So I observed myself closely while walking. I noticed that I had a tendency to do a weird retracting motion on the toe when walking, a motion I do not use on my left foot. I questioned the purpose of this reflex. I found that I could &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; not to perform the retracting motion. It was difficult to make this choice, but if I really focused, I could control how I &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; my foot. I remembered lessons from &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_technique&#34;&gt;Alexander technique&lt;/a&gt; about observing and unlearning habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I discovered the reason my right hip has sometimes felt sore: my right hip has sagged in my posture. I also found that correcting this shifted the balance of weight on my right foot, and alleviated the pressure on my second toe, shifting more weight where it should be, more toward the big toe under the ball of the foot. These were very interesting discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, I felt so tired that I decided to go ahead and cancel my Sunday plan to play in the final round of the Pittsburgh Chess League season; I had really wanted to put in one final appearance for our team, after not having actually played for us since &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/11/11/pittsburgh-chess-league-round-3-back-to-chess-after-a-month-off/&#34;&gt;last November&lt;/a&gt;, because something kept on coming up every month since then, but I had little confidence that I would be mentally alert on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;friday-still-playing-it-safe&#34;&gt;Friday: still playing it safe&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday, I was feeling energetic enough to run, but I forced myself to take another day off for the sake of my right toe. It was not easy, but I reminded myself that &lt;em&gt;not being able to do my long run&lt;/em&gt; was not worth one more missed day of training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of running, I did one rep of the Cathedral of Learning stair climb, just to get some activity in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;saturday-my-14-mile-long-run&#34;&gt;Saturday: my 14-mile long run&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, I felt my right toe had recovered sufficiently that I was going to be OK doing my planned long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Steel City Road Runners had a 10-mile run lined up starting in Shadyside after a program of dynamics warmups by Dr. Vonda Wright, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pittsburghmarathon.com/wow.asp&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Warmup on Walnut&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, outside of sponsor &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.truerunner.com/&#34;&gt;True Runner&lt;/a&gt;. My plan was to skip that program, but create a 14-mile run by running 2 miles from home to the Shadyside point and then joining the group run and then running 2 miles back home afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the 10-mile loop:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe id=&#34;mapmyfitness_route&#34; src=&#34;http://snippets.mapmycdn.com/routes/view/embedded/187175578?width=560&amp;height=400&amp;elevation=true&amp;info=true&amp;line_color=E60f0bdb&amp;rgbhex=DB0B0E&amp;distance_markers=1&amp;unit_type=imperial&amp;map_mode=TERRAIN&amp;last_updated=2013-04-01T09:44:11-04:00&#34; height=&#34;590px&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: right; padding-right: 20px;&#34;&gt;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;http://mapmyrun.com/routes/create/&#34;&gt;Create Maps&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;http://mapmyrun.com/routes/&#34;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; from 80 million at &lt;a href=&#34;http://mapmyrun.com&#34;&gt;MapMyRun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-goal&#34;&gt;My goal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal for this long run was to make it a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mcmillanrunning.com/index.php/articlePages/article/2&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;fast finish long run&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. In particular, in planning my run, I had noted that the last 5 miles of the course involved a steady uphill as well as a steeper uphill through Oakland on Forbes Avenue. In the 2003 Pittsburgh Marathon ten years ago, this uphill had proved a bit discouraging to me (because I had, frankly, gone out too fast). In any case, for psychological and physiological reasons, I wanted to do this whole uphill fast and strong in this particular workout. In the actual marathon in a month, of course, I don&amp;rsquo;t plan to run it as fast, but I did want to remember the landmarks and mental state of doing something difficult but in a relaxed way. I wanted to focus on applying my newly discovered knowledge about my posture and stride asymmetry and &amp;ldquo;run tall&amp;rdquo; up the hill, with balanced hips, while monitoring my right second toe to make sure it did not get battered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was still not comfortable with the Luna Sandals, so I fell back to the shoes I&amp;rsquo;ve been wearing for almost all of my runs in the past three months, the Bikila LS shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;showed-up-late&#34;&gt;Showed up late&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I strangely miscalculated my departure from home to run 2 miles to Aiken Avenue and Walnut Street, and showed up 4 minutes late, just as runners were already heading off. I grabbed a printed map and picked up the pace so that I could try to catch up to the 10:00 pace group. I did, realizing of course that I was making my task in the final miles of my run more difficult as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conquering-the-oakland-hill&#34;&gt;Conquering the Oakland hill&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed the Oakland hill pretty well, being very focused. I continued going hard all the way back to True Runner in Shadyside. Near the end, I felt my calves getting tight, just as in the half marathon last week when my right calf seized up after I was walking after the finish line. I thought it was very useful to have triggered this exact sensation and knowing where it was, because it meant that maybe I would be able to train my body to accept that state of fatigue (after running 12 miles) and continue. Also, the feeling cleared up fairly quickly after I stopped to walk, so I think last week the real trigger was my pointless little sprint near the end. If I avoid any sprinting during the marathon, I might well be able to avoid cramping. At least, that is the plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-decision-about-gatorade&#34;&gt;A decision about Gatorade&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I drank some more Gatorade back at Walnut Street, then ran home. I was really quite tired by this point and my stomach wasn&amp;rsquo;t feeling so great. I ate some actual food and eventually recovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this run, no gels were provided, so I drank Gatorade as my only fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my final conclusion, solidifying a thought I had last week in the half marathon: &lt;em&gt;Gatorade is bad for me&lt;/em&gt;, and I should &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; avoid it in future runs and in the Pittsburgh Marathon! It was good to learn this for sure now. In fact, it is quite possible that some of the issues I had in the 2003 Pittsburgh Marathon were a result of Gatorade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GU gel works OK for me, but according to the official &lt;a href=&#34;http://pittsburghmarathon.com/Course.asp&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Marathon fluid station table&lt;/a&gt;, GU is provided only starting at mile 9.7. Therefore, I am going to pack some gels to ingest during the first 10 miles of the marathon! I will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; drink any Gatorade!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some ill-advised overtraining and injury this week after my half marathon, I forced myself to take two days off to recover, and used the time to diagnose possible causes of my biomechanical problems. I found some good hypotheses and possible solutions, and managed a high quality &amp;ldquo;fast finish long run&amp;rdquo; and am optimistic about my continuing training for the Pittsburgh Marathon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Updated 2013-05-09 with official race videos!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until today, I had not run a half marathon in nine years. This distance had given me a lot of trouble the five times I did it in 2001-2004. So I was very anxious about running &lt;a href=&#34;http://eliterunners.com/just-a-short-run/&#34;&gt;Just A Short Run&lt;/a&gt; this morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s why I feared it, and how I ended up unexpectedly pleased with the experience, including finishing over four minutes faster than my goal time.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/just-a-short-run-2013/franklin.jpg&#34; /&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin done&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;past-participation-in-just-a-short-run&#34;&gt;Past participation in Just A Short Run&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the fifth time I participated in Just A Short Run. This race began in 2001, when &lt;a href=&#34;http://eliterunners.com/running-shoes-pittsburgh/about-running-store/&#34;&gt;Kevin Smith&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://eliterunners.com/&#34;&gt;Elite Runners and Walkers&lt;/a&gt; created in in memory of his younger brother who died of leukemia, to &lt;a href=&#34;http://eliterunners.com/just-a-short-run-about/&#34;&gt;support the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/ipDidl-_qpM&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until today I have done the Just A Short Run four times:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5K in 2001&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;half marathon in 2002&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30K in 2003 (my only DNF in my life, because I went into it sick)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5K in 2004&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;past-half-marathons&#34;&gt;Past half marathons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have only once ever partly successfully executed a half marathon race, and even then, some things went rather wrong. Here&amp;rsquo;s a summary of what went wrong in each of my half marathons up till today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ikea-montour-trail-half-marathon-2001&#34;&gt;Ikea Montour Trail half marathon, 2001&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my very first half marathon, after having run some good 5K races earlier in the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went out too fast (because of an initial downhill that got me too excited), and paid the price. I finished in 1:47:23. My splits for the 13.1 miles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6:31.94&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7:59.53&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8:09.44&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8:16.53&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8:16.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8:19.28&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8:19.64&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7:44.85&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8:01.41&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8:23.29&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8:28.72&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8:42.36&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9:17.34&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0:49.85&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was just struggling in the last miles, and very demoralized. I almost collapsed on my buddy Jude&amp;rsquo;s shoulder after I finished. Also, I had major blisters during the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;just-a-short-run-half-marathon-2002&#34;&gt;Just A Short Run half marathon, 2002&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did this race without any real training at all, just because it was there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got blisters in the race, and also had to deal with weird existential thoughts like &amp;ldquo;Why am I running this?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished in 1:49:34, but actually, the course was found to be long by about a tenth of a mile, so that number does not mean much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ikea-montour-trail-half-marathon-2002&#34;&gt;Ikea Montour Trail half marathon, 2002&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got my revenge in this race, actually training hard specifically for the distance, doing long intervals and a lot of tempo and race-pace runs. Overall I did very well, finishing in 1:38:48, but the experience was marred by some serious problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran mile 4 too fast, but since I was carefully monitoring on my watch, I slowed down for mile 5. Still, one pays the price eventually for going too fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I still was not fueling consistently. I erred by taking both water and energy drink, resulting in dilution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mile 12, my calves started cramping up and I had to stop at one point. I lost about half a minute because of this. In mile 13, I had to run conservatively to avoid cramps. It was very frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, after I finished, while getting on the shuttle bus, I cramped up quite severely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ikea-montour-trail-half-marathon-2003&#34;&gt;Ikea Montour Trail half marathon, 2003&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A total disaster. I finished in 1:45:32, which is 7:44 slower than the previous year. This was while having a 5K fitness similar to the previous year&amp;rsquo;s. Something just went wrong. I felt sluggish throughout, and I cramped up in mile 10. And I had digestive problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chamber-classic-half-marathon-2004&#34;&gt;Chamber Classic half marathon, 2004&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1:46:12. No real training for it, just did it because it was there and I had not been able to do the Montour Trail one. A fiasco, in which I struggled with my usual problems (slowing down in the final miles, cramping).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;preparation&#34;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not go into this race truly prepared to &lt;em&gt;race&lt;/em&gt; the half marathon. I know what it takes to race a half marathon for time: long tempo and race-pace runs, long intervals. I have done little of that so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hardest training run so far has been &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/03/16/18-miles-in-vibram-fivefingers-training-for-the-pittsburgh-marathon/&#34;&gt;16 miles with the Steel City Road Runners, two weeks ago, on an 18 mile course&lt;/a&gt;. I did not truly taper for the half marathon race, although this week including the race I have a reduced mileage of 25 (easy 6, easy 3, speed ladder 3, and then the race).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, what I am really training for is the Pittsburgh Marathon, but I felt that I should do a half marathon race in order to get a taste of what it is like to run in a long race. I have been doing long runs every week for a while now, so running the half marathon distance is not a problem: the challenge for me was to figure out if I could partially &lt;em&gt;race&lt;/em&gt; it, to find my limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I wanted to fix the problems I had in my previous half marathons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blistering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;going out too fast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;slowing way down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cramping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;digestive problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;blistering&#34;&gt;Blistering&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solving the problem of blistering has been trivial for me since I switched to wearing Vibram FiveFingers shoes. I just don&amp;rsquo;t get serious blisters any more; my feet have adapted completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, I just got my Luna Sandals two days ago, but have not run in them yet. Friends helpfully convinced me that it would be crazy to wear them in the race without any actual test of them (I knew that, but just needed validation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;em&gt;first half marathon&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m running in Vibram FiveFingers. Up till now, the longest distance I&amp;rsquo;ve raced in FiveFingers has been &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/09/25/blistered-but-blissful-in-the-burgh/&#34;&gt;10K, when I was still getting blistered by the Bikila LS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;going-out-too-fast&#34;&gt;Going out too fast&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By not treating this as an all-out race whose goal is to minimize time, I could afford to run more conservatively and plan on negative-splitting. I decide to target a time of 1:55:00 (reasonable given &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/03/03/my-first-steel-city-road-runners-winter-5k-race/&#34;&gt;my recent 5K&lt;/a&gt; time of 25:11), with the idea of speeding up if it felt right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;slowing-way-down&#34;&gt;Slowing way down&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I consciously carb-loaded for this half marathon and had a race fueling plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cramping&#34;&gt;Cramping&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea how to really solve this problem. I think I must be genetically predisposed to cramping. People like to claim electrolyte deficiency is the cause, but I don&amp;rsquo;t believe this at all, because I have tried loading up on electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;digestive-problems&#34;&gt;Digestive problems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have concluded that it is safest to avoid Gatorade and the like on the course because people mix it in funny proportions. Sticking with predictable gels and water is my new plan. One gel before starting the race, and then one gel every 45 minutes after that (which in the case of a half marathon means two gels on the course).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I used to drink too much water, resulting in sloshing in the stomach. So I drink less now during a race, and drink more well before it starts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-route&#34;&gt;The route&lt;/h2&gt;

Note the big hill at the beginning. Control of effort going up and down hills is critical, to avoid bad spikes in energy usage.

## The race

Here are the [official race results](http://www.runhigh.com/2013RESULTS/R033013AA.html).

### Start


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/just-a-short-run-2013/announcements.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Announcements&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


I started out with the 1:55:00 finish pacer (8:47 pace):


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/just-a-short-run-2013/pacer.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;My initial pacer&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


Going up the big hill, however, he totally lost me, as I slowed down to avoid prematurely feeling the burn. In fact, a slower pacer even passed me. No problem.

On the downhill, I quickly started regaining ground. I think after around three miles, I had caught up to the original 8:47 pacer, and then that was feeling too slow for me, so I passed him for good, and never saw a pacer again in the race.

### Gatorade error

I made an error at one of the aid stations when I mistaken grabbed Gatorade and threw it in my face. I got stickiness all over my face and the front of my jacket and fingers. It was really disgusting, actually. I will be more careful in the future to ask what stuff is before taking a cup.

Otherwise, I stuck well to my plan of taking water and two gels during the entire half marathon. Note that the race provided [e-Gel](http://www.cranksports.com/products/eGel/), which I had not had before. If I were seriously racing this half marathon, obviously I would have bought and tried this stuff on long runs ahead of time.

### Passing people

The thing about Just A Short Run is that people are running different races and therefore are at different paces, and also in such a huge race, there are always those who are inexperienced and go out too fast and slow down. What this means, in practice, is that if you are running evenly (or for a negative split, like I was doing), you will be needing to pass people constantly. It is very important to be a good judge of your own pace, because otherwise you might think you are doing OK, while the reality is you&#39;re following someone who is slowing down.

I like to target someone who looks faster than me and then try to keep up with him or her. I did this repeatedly in the race.

At one point I asked a guy what his pace was, and he said 8:30. I was feeling good, so eventually I passed him. I realized at that moment that I was going to be able to run considerably faster than 1:55:00, despite my very slow start.

### Last five miles

I maintained speed in the last 5 miles of the race; I might even have gone faster, but without the data, I cannot tell, since when fatigue sets in, effort does not equal actual pace. I was definitely getting tired, but I kept pushing, trying to pretend I was running a 10K race or something. I thought that I just might have a shot at finishing under 1:50:00. I didn&#39;t, but that&#39;s OK. I finished in 1:50:52.

The official [split data](http://www.runhigh.com/2013RESULTS/R033013AF.html) shows that I did the last 5 miles in 42:03, which is about 8:25 pace. Since I averaged 8:28 pace for the whole race, I clearly ran faster in the last 5 miles than in the first 8.1 miles.

If I had known what I was capable of, I could have run faster and more evenly from the start, and finished faster, but that was quite explicitly *not* the goal today. The goal was to finish strong, which I did.

## SPIbelt

This was my first time running a race wearing a SPIbelt. It did not cause me any trouble at all; I barely noticed it. I will wear it during the Pittsburgh Marathon, in order to have my phone on me in case of emergency. I did not use my phone during the race, only before and after it, but it&#39;s always nice to know that I can directly contact Abby if something goes wrong.

## Cramping

I did a little bit of a final sprint across the finish line. The moment I crossed was the moment when I felt both of my calves start to twitch. I realized that I almost crossed the line to full-on cramping, and decided to keep moving. I grabbed a banana and ate it while jogging slowly, and planning to jog off the heaviness in my calves.

Then disaster struck: I stubbed my right toes on the ground and instantly two of my toes cramped up and my lower right calf also cramped up. I ripped off my shoe and luckily, after about twenty seconds, I was OK again. I decided it was unsafe to keep moving, and I went upstairs in the North Park Boat House to just keep warm and stretch in a safe environment. I did not cramp up again.

So I have not entirely solved the cramping problem. Apparently sprinting was enough to push me over the edge. Also, closed-toe shoes are a problem because my toes inevitably get at least somewhat jammed in the course of running in closed-toe shoes. This is why I want to test out the Luna Sandals, which may completely prevent toe jamming and cramping. As for my calves, I don&#39;t know, maybe I just need to do more hard longer runs in order to get them accustomed to the lactic acid buildup or something.

## Post-race eating

My stomach was entirely OK during the race. No water sloshing, no indigestion, no gnawing hunger. I was hungry after finishing, of course.


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/just-a-short-run-2013/food.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Post-race food&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


I made some mistakes after finishing, however. I ate not only a banana, but also a bagel, a Smiley Cookie, a little bag of chips, and a little bag of cookies. I believe I should have excluded the bag of cookies and the chips, and saved the Smiley Cookie for later. I had some digestive discomfort (nothing serious though) for a while after everything I ate. I will remember next time. After a 5K or 10K, I can eat anything, but apparently, after a half marathon, digestion is trickier.

But it is hard not to gobble up a Smiley Cookie:


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/just-a-short-run-2013/smiley-cookie.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Smiley Cookie&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


At home, I ended up deciding to eat familiar leftovers rather than going out to a buffet as I had originally thought of doing with Abby.

## Feet

My feet were sore, but actually, less sore than after each of my long runs in the past month. I think I&#39;ve become more efficient. No knee pain either. After the race, just general inflammation. I think I&#39;ll be OK tomorrow.


&lt;figure &gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin&amp;#39;s soles of feet&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


I did get one small blister, on my right pinkie toe, but I didn&#39;t actually notice it until I was home and took a shower.

## What does all this mean for the marathon?

This [race time predictor](http://www.runnersworld.co.uk/general/rws-race-time-predictor/1681.html) suggests that given that I ran a half marathon in 1:50:52, I can do a full marathon in 3:51:08. I am, frankly, skeptical that I can go under 4:00:00 at all a month from now. I know I want to be conservative in the marathon, and I rather doubt I will be able to negative-split it, and I still have concerns about late-stage cramping or other physical deterioration. We shall see how my training progresses. I am going to start adding &#34;quality&#34; work in the form of interval training in order to toughen up.

## Thanks

Many thanks to my wife Abby, who dropped me off at the race and picked me up after visiting her parents in the vicinity, saving me driving and parking hassles! And thanks to all my friends who have been supportive while I&#39;ve been so nervous for weeks about this race!

I like to thank [Elite Runners and Walkers](http://eliterunners.com/) for putting on a really well-organized race. The instructions were very clear, volunteers giving out water, Gatorade, and gels were everywhere, there was plenty of post-race food, bag check was convenient, and everything seemed to go smoothly. I would like to take this opportunity to say that without Elite Runners and Walkers, I do not know where I would be as a runner. Back over a decade ago, when I started running, the Internet was not what it is now. I got information about running from books and magazines and word of mouth more than anything else. I was told about the new store Elite Runners and Walkers and I got some of my first running shoes and clothing there. I even bought my very first pair of Vibram FiveFingers KSO shoes there, in 2009, before minimalist shoes suddenly became more mainstream and available in other stores, and last year when I got some rips in those first Vibram FiveFingers shoes, I got a new pair of KSO shoes through them also. And the races they put on in the winter and spring are great: I used to run their [Spring Thaw](http://eliterunners.com/events/annual-spring-thaw/) as well as Just A Short Run. And when picking up my race packet at the store this week, Abby and I bought some more shirts and shorts in preparation for summer!

## Conclusion

This was my slowest half marathon ever, but one of the most satisfying, and one of the best-executed, given my actual fitness level, which is substantially lower than that of a decade ago. I may consider *really* racing a half marathon in the fall. Meanwhile, I definitely found the successful completion of this half marathon to be a confidence booster for the upcoming Pittsburgh Marathon. Yes, there is no real comparison between the two distances, but it&#39;s just the fact that this is a long race at all, compared to, say, a 5K or 10K.

### From start to 1:30:00

#### Start

I couldn&#39;t find myself in the half marathon start, because it&#39;s too congested.

#### Additional loop 1

I found myself arriving under &#34;Additional loops&#34; at 27:09 on the clock to begin the first of two 5-mile loops.

(To jump immediately to the spot, click [here](http://youtu.be/BukDHKvc7rk?t=12m50s).)

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/BukDHKvc7rk&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I crossed the start line after 21 seconds, I really ran 26:48 for the first 3.1 miles (average 8:39 pace).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;additional-loop-2&#34;&gt;Additional loop 2&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, watch me cross &amp;ldquo;Additional loops&amp;rdquo; at around 1:09:09 on the clock, which means I did 5 miles in 42:00 (average 8:24 pace).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(To jump immediately to the spot, click &lt;a href=&#34;http://youtu.be/BukDHKvc7rk?t=46m11s&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;from-1-31-00-to-3-21-00&#34;&gt;From 1:31:00 to 3:21:00&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;sprint-finish&#34;&gt;Sprint finish&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch my sprint finish from clock time around 1:51:03 to finish at 1:51:12 (my chip time was 1:50:51, meaning I crossed the start line after 21 seconds), which means I did the last 5 miles in 42:03, almost exactly the same time as I did the first 5-mile loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(To jump immediately to the spot, click &lt;a href=&#34;http://youtu.be/wdjy7eLUlwQ?t=15m41s&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;from-3-23-00-to-4-07-00&#34;&gt;From 3:23:00 to 4:07:00&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was already done, so I am not in this video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/t4Zwv-tSLVM&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-of-2014-03-09&#34;&gt;(Update of 2014-03-09)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, I did not set a goal to run a spring half marathon, so I did not train in the winter months for one, and so I am sadly missing Just A Short Run. Maybe there&amp;rsquo;s still time for me to get back into regular running and aim to do a half marathon in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Only one easy rep of the Cathedral of Learning stair climb</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/03/17/only-one-easy-rep-of-the-cathedral-of-learning-stair-climb/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Team Ferlee met up yet again for a Cathedral of Learning stair climb workout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I originally had not planned to even attend this time, for more than one reason:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;recovery from the crazy tough 18 mile Steel City Road Runners training run yesterday, of which I actually ran around 16 miles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;having a Pittsburgh Recorder Society meeting to attend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;having a St. Patrick&amp;rsquo;s Day party to attend after the recorder society meeting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I missed not having seen the team since &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/03/10/now-at-four-reps-of-the-cathedral-of-learning-stair-climb/&#34;&gt;last week, when I crazily did four reps&lt;/a&gt;. I decided to show up briefly just to say hello before rushing off to the recorder society meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help myself, and ended up doing one leisurely rep before leaving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was actually probably a good thing to have done, because I left feeling less sore and tired. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely true in my experience that the day after a hard workout (as in my 16 mile run), one should resist the temptation to just be sedentary, and instead do something easy that increases circulation and warms the body in order to speed healing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s kind of funny to refer to an &amp;ldquo;easy&amp;rdquo; rep of doing a 36-floor stair climb, but in reality, after these months of gradual buildups, going up once at a leisurely pace is not actually hard for me at all any more. That&amp;rsquo;s encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team was amused I did this in my dress shirt and slacks (I did take off my socks and shoes and jacket and carried them in my hands while going up), but this is, after all, how I got started just before New Year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;six-days-left&#34;&gt;Six days left&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are only six more days left till the Fight for Air Climb. I haven&amp;rsquo;t trained as much for this event as I would have liked, because my priority has been Pittsburgh Marathon training, but at some point this week I need to do some last-minute speed work in order to get at least some race sharpness for the Fight for Air Climb.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>18 miles in Vibram FiveFingers: training for the Pittsburgh Marathon through a St. Patrick&#39;s Day parade</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/03/16/18-miles-in-vibram-fivefingers-training-for-the-pittsburgh-marathon/</link>

      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/03/16/18-miles-in-vibram-fivefingers-training-for-the-pittsburgh-marathon/</guid>
      <description>&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/18-miles/st-patricks-day-parade-prep.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Pittsburgh St. Patrick&amp;#39;s Day preparation&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My second &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.steelcityrrc.org/scrrcevents?eventId=619953&amp;amp;EventViewMode=2&amp;amp;CalendarViewType=1&amp;amp;SelectedDate=3/30/2013&#34;&gt;Saturday group training run with the Steel City Runners&lt;/a&gt; happened to be on St. Patrick&amp;rsquo;s Day weekend, and therefore took place just before the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pittsburghirish.org/parade/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh St. Patrick&amp;rsquo;s Day parade&lt;/a&gt;, which starts at 10 AM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;overtraining-and-knees&#34;&gt;Overtraining and knees&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/03/09/11-pittsburgh-bridge-crossings-in-one-12-mile-run/&#34;&gt;Last week I mentioned&lt;/a&gt; that I was having problems because of overtraining; I ran five days one week only to have to scale back to three the next. This week I consciously got in four days of running, with higher total mileage than either of the previous two weeks (when I did 26 and 23). This week, I got in 29. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy, especially given that I ran last week&amp;rsquo;s long run too hard and therefore had left knee oddness that actually lasted three days! It wasn&amp;rsquo;t so bad that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t run, but I clearly had to let it heal up, which it did in time for another long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, both of John&amp;rsquo;s knees were in serious pain the day after last week&amp;rsquo;s training run, and a week later, he is still waiting for them to heal up, and therefore did not join me for today&amp;rsquo;s training run. Oops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;plan&#34;&gt;Plan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For today&amp;rsquo;s run, I decided to run &lt;em&gt;only the first 16 miles&lt;/em&gt; and then walk the last 2 miles. Also, I joined the 10-minute pace group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that a lot of things went &amp;ldquo;wrong&amp;rdquo; on this run, but I got back to the start OK in the end!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;unknown-territory&#34;&gt;Unknown territory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wore my Vibram FiveFingers Bikila LS shoes again. This is an important test, because I have &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; been on the road for 18 miles straight in these shoes before, run or walk! I need to know whether wearing these for the Pittsburgh Marathon will work out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;weather-conditions&#34;&gt;Weather conditions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had watched the forecast all week with concern that it might be pouring rain, but I was committed to do this run regardless of conditions, because if the Pittsburgh Marathon involves running in rain, I need to be ready to deal with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that we lucked out; although it was cold, there was drizzling rain but no downpour!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Start of run&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-route&#34;&gt;The route&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the route of the 18-mile training run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe id=&#34;mapmyfitness_route&#34; src=&#34;http://snippets.mapmycdn.com/routes/view/embedded/180281790?width=560&amp;height=400&amp;elevation=true&amp;info=true&amp;line_color=E60f0bdb&amp;rgbhex=DB0B0E&amp;distance_markers=1&amp;unit_type=imperial&amp;map_mode=TERRAIN&amp;last_updated=2013-03-11T10:51:41-04:00&#34; height=&#34;590px&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: right; padding-right: 20px;&#34;&gt;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;http://mapmyrun.com/routes/create/&#34;&gt;Create Maps&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;http://mapmyrun.com/routes/&#34;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; from 80 million at &lt;a href=&#34;http://mapmyrun.com&#34;&gt;MapMyRun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-run&#34;&gt;The run&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with the 10-minute pace group. I actually immediately fell back, wanting to start off running more slowly,  but was never too far from the pack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;st-patrick-s-day&#34;&gt;St. Patrick&amp;rsquo;s Day&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately and throughout the run, I saw people in green who were a little loud and clearly had a bit to drink. I was amused that they were up and around already at 8 AM in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended up running on Liberty Avenue through the setup for St. Patrick&amp;rsquo;s Day parade downtown (which begins at 10 AM). We got some cheers (many of us were wearing green) as well as some jeers. It was a strange experience, and I felt a bit embarrassed to be running through parade preparation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/18-miles/st-patricks-day-parade-prep.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Pittsburgh St. Patrick&amp;#39;s Day preparation&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;first-water-stop&#34;&gt;First water stop&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the first water stop, I drank some water and grabbed a GU gel to go. I caught up to the 10-minute pace group at the first water stop, since a lot of people didn&amp;rsquo;t immediately keep going but waited for everyone to get water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My new system with gels is to take one and then eat it some minutes after drinking water, rather than immediately with water. It saves time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;big-uphill-and-losing-my-map&#34;&gt;Big uphill and losing my map&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a big uphill going east on Liberty Ave during which I lost the 10-minute pace group because I prefer to go slower uphill to maintain an even &lt;em&gt;effort&lt;/em&gt; rather than &lt;em&gt;pace&lt;/em&gt;. I always make up the loss on the downhills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;second-water-stop&#34;&gt;Second water stop&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second water stop was near mile 8 in Shadyside. I caught up yet again to the 10-minute pace group at that point, and took another GU gel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I realized that I must have lost my paper map while running up Liberty Avenue. This was bad, because although I roughly knew the route, I did not know all the details. I did have my smartphone on me, but the MapMyRun Web site did not display very well on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worse, it appeared after the second water stop that the 10-minute pace group was either going much slower or I was all &amp;ldquo;warmed up&amp;rdquo; and going much faster, because I could not tolerate their pace, and I decided I had to forge ahead into Oakland, even though there was nobody ahead that I could follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did find two other people who were willing to go at a faster pace along with me, so the three of us took off into Oakland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;birmingham-bridge&#34;&gt;Birmingham Bridge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three of us crossed the Birmingham Bridge together to the South Side. I remarked that the last time I did the Pittsburgh Marathon ten years ago, I was humbled by the uphill going &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; Oakland (in the other direction) on the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/18-miles/birmingham-bridge.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Birmingham Bridge to South Side&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;south-side-and-falling-behind&#34;&gt;South Side and falling behind&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The South Side was a total party scene, as might be expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going east on Carson Street, I suddenly noticed at around mile 11 that I had lost one of my gloves. I had taken off my gloves earlier as it was getting warmer, and put them in my pockets, but just as I had lost my map because I hadn&amp;rsquo;t zipped my jacket pockets, I had now lost a glove. I apologized to my two companions and said I was turning back to find my glove if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, my glove was just a block back, and a group of runners saw it and picked it up and gave it to me. But now my two companions were far away from me. I could still see them, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to run super fast just to catch them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;three-rivers-heritage-trail-and-getting-lost&#34;&gt;Three Rivers Heritage Trail and getting lost&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw my companions turn onto the Three Rivers Heritage Trail. At this point, I no longer knew exactly what the rest of the route was for the last 8 miles. I knew that there was a water/gel stop at some point in the next 7 miles before the West End Bridge, but had no idea where it was!! I really didn&amp;rsquo;t want to miss the final water/gel stop, since that would mean going 8 miles without any water or fuel. Of course, I did have some money on me, so I could stop somewhere to refuel, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t really want to stop if I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I&amp;rsquo;d run around 12 miles and my feet were definitely sore. It was a huge relief to be running on the trail, actually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I made a mistake. I suddenly saw what seemed to be a water stop because a bunch of runners were gathering there. I approached and asked if it was the Steel City Road Runners water stop and they said no, it was Elite Runners and Walkers. They offered to give me some water anyway, but I declined, which was a mistake, because during the seconds I spent on this detour, I lost sight of my two companions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kept on running on the trail but they were just gone, and I never saw them again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;running-to-the-west-end-bridge&#34;&gt;Running to the West End Bridge&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just kept on running west, figuring I would eventually get to the West End Bridge. I went through Station Square and made it across the West End Bridge. Now, I had planned ahead of time to stop running shortly after crossing the West End Bridge, because it was going to be 16 miles then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I started feeling cold, and so I did some run/walking east all the way back to the start. It was very lonely going the last 8 miles of the route alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;safe-and-warm&#34;&gt;Safe and warm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made it back OK. I grabbed two energy bars and went inside to get warm and stretch and devour the two energy bars. My feet were totally killing me, but I had survived 18 miles on them in Vibram FiveFingers Bikila LS shoes. I still have no idea whether I can last a whole marathon in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-feet&#34;&gt;My feet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although my feet are sore, everything seems to be OK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;photos&#34;&gt;Photos&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/steelcityrrc&#34;&gt;Steel City Road Runners Facebook site&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.425827677512050.1073741827.391728257588659&amp;amp;type=1&#34;&gt;photo album of the St. Patrick&amp;rsquo;s Day run&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran about 16 miles of the 18-mile route, as planned, but got lost, which I did not plan. I learned some lessons. In the future, I am zipping my jacket pockets, and I am also studying the printed map thoroughly before starting one of these runs. My super-sore feet have me worried about running the marathon in Vibram FiveFingers, so I will investigate alternatives. I&amp;rsquo;m still waiting for my order this week of &lt;a href=&#34;http://lunasandals.com/&#34;&gt;Luna Sandals&lt;/a&gt; to come in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I&amp;rsquo;m thankful that Steel City Road Runners made it possible for me to do such a long run without feeling completely alone, and not having to haul all the water and fuel I needed during and after the run. Ten years ago when I was marathon training, I did carry along everything I needed, but it really is much nicer to simulate actual race conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am grateful that when I was done and called home, Abby baked a pizza for us to share when I got back. Fuel! Abby has been understanding and supportive during my training for the Pittsburgh Marathon. She thinks it&amp;rsquo;s a crazy thing to do, and it is, but I want to do it this once again while I have the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Now at four reps of the Cathedral of Learning stair climb!</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/03/10/now-at-four-reps-of-the-cathedral-of-learning-stair-climb/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2013 21:07:54 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/03/10/now-at-four-reps-of-the-cathedral-of-learning-stair-climb/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I joined a Team Ferlee group stair climb workout at the Cathedral of Learning for the second time. &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/02/24/finally-doing-the-cathedral-of-learning-stair-climb-as-part-of-team-ferlee/&#34;&gt;Two weeks ago&lt;/a&gt; I did two reps and ten floors total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still in recovery from doing yesterday a really tough 12 mile Steel City Road Runners training run for the Pittsburgh Marathon, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what exactly I planned to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that thanks to Bill, with whom I finally climbed for the first time today, I did more than I had originally intended. In retrospect, I probably shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have, but I did, so what&amp;rsquo;s done is done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-workout&#34;&gt;The workout&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team did the first two reps sort of together, which meant not very fast for Bill or me. That was fine. I like socializing and going easy to warm up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the third rep, Bill decided he wanted to do a fast one, so he timed himself. I tried to follow him, but in my depleted condition had no plan to kill myself to overtake him. I just wanted to test an honest genuinely fast, but not all out, third rep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He ended up doing the third rep in 7:26, his new personal record. I did not time myself, but finished probably about ten seconds behind him, I gathered, so I did around 7:36. This was clearly the fastest I&amp;rsquo;ve also done one rep of the stair climb, not that I&amp;rsquo;ve been timing myself much in the past months (check out &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/01/19/why-ive-chosen-to-perform-only-two-repetitions-of-the-cathedral-of-learning-stair-climb/&#34;&gt;my reports from two months ago&lt;/a&gt;, when I timed myself just to get an idea of my baseline).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-fourth-rep&#34;&gt;My fourth rep&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone was done after the third rep, but I decided to hang around to do one last rep by myself, since I felt strangely OK even after the hard third rep; recovery from that seemed rather quick. The marathon training I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing has clearly helped with my endurance for stair climbing as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I did an untimed fourth rep just because I could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having done four reps with good form is starting to give me confidence that in two weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to put in a good all-out effort in the Fight for Air Climb.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>11 Pittsburgh bridge crossings in one 12-mile run</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/03/09/11-pittsburgh-bridge-crossings-in-one-12-mile-run/</link>

      <description>&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/602768_422297731198378_798317370_n.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;View from Mount Washington&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My first ever &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.steelcityrrc.org/scrrcevents?eventId=568739&amp;amp;EventViewMode=2&amp;amp;CalendarViewType=1&amp;amp;SelectedDate=3/16/2013&#34;&gt;Steel City Road Runners Saturday morning training run&lt;/a&gt; was a 12-mile run. My office mate John went with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time I ran as far as 12 miles &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/02/24/2013-pittsburgh-marathon-training-progress-since-signing-up-three-weeks-ago/&#34;&gt;was in February&lt;/a&gt;, so I expected to do OK. The important difference is that I have been increasing my weekly mileage. I had a monster training week last week, going up from 13 miles to 26 miles last week, the &lt;em&gt;largest&lt;/em&gt; training volume I have had in a single week in years. I&amp;rsquo;ll confess that this has taken a toll on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, I have backed off this week, such that including this 12-mile run (I will not run tomorrow), this week I will have 23 miles. In the long haul, &lt;em&gt;overtraining&lt;/em&gt; is a huge waste of time and energy. Unfortunately, in my attempt to &amp;ldquo;catch up&amp;rdquo; some because of the marathon coming in less than two months, I did in fact overtrain to an extent; last week I ran five out of seven days in order to reach that mileage of 26. This week, I tried to up the mileage but felt tired and wisely decided to rest when I needed to, even though that meant this week I ran only three days! Obviously, in retrospect, it would have been wiser to run four days last week and four this week, with better overall training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I did enjoy today&amp;rsquo;s training run. It involved the most bridge crossings I have ever done in my life in a single day (by foot or otherwise): eleven!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my report on the training run, including, of course, photos of bridge crossings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sign-in&#34;&gt;Sign in&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John and I signed in at 8 AM. It was going to be a beautiful, sunny day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We received printed maps of the route. I did have my smartphone with me, wearing it in my SPIbelt, so I felt pretty safe about knowing where I am or where to go in case I got lost.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/11-pittsburgh-bridge-crossings/sign-in.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Steel City Road Runners sign in&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There is indoor access to restrooms, water fountains, and warmth at these Steel City Road Runners training run meetings. Very nice for winter!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were designated pacers. I was uncertain about which pace group I should join, if any at all. I felt that probably the 10-minute pace group might be on the slow side, but definitely I did not expect to keep up with the 9-minute pace group for a long run. But we decided to start off with the 9-minute pace group and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/11-pittsburgh-bridge-crossings/pace-groups.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Pacers&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I wore my Vibram FiveFingers Bikila LS shoes, which have been my main running shoes all winter (when there is no snow or water on the ground):&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/11-pittsburgh-bridge-crossings/vibram-fivefingers-bikila-ls.jpg&#34; /&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-route&#34;&gt;The route&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the route of the 12-mile training run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe id=&#34;mapmyfitness_route&#34; src=&#34;http://snippets.mapmycdn.com/routes/view/embedded/178234904?width=560&amp;height=400&amp;elevation=true&amp;info=true&amp;line_color=E60f0bdb&amp;rgbhex=DB0B0E&amp;distance_markers=1&amp;unit_type=imperial&amp;map_mode=TERRAIN&amp;last_updated=2013-03-08T12:47:36-06:00&#34; height=&#34;590px&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: right; padding-right: 20px;&#34;&gt;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;http://mapmyrun.com/routes/create/&#34;&gt;Create Maps&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;http://mapmyrun.com/routes/&#34;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; from 80 million at &lt;a href=&#34;http://mapmyrun.com&#34;&gt;MapMyRun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-bridge-crossings&#34;&gt;The bridge crossings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 9-minute pace group was clearly going too fast for me. I hung off the back hoping to simply keep them in sight as they kept getting more ahead of me. To my surprise, John went with the group, even though he has not run in months. I was not sure it was wise of him not to have done any running before this training run, and am worried about his going too fast all of a sudden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;first-water-stop-and-getting-lost&#34;&gt;First water stop and getting lost!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first water stop was after 4 miles:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/11-pittsburgh-bridge-crossings/first-water-stop.jpg&#34; /&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;First water stop&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;By the time I had reached this water stop, John and the rest of the 9-minute pace group were way ahead of me and barely visible. Unfortunately, after I drank some Gatorade, I noticed that I didn&amp;rsquo;t see them at all any more. So for almost the rest of the run, the following 8 miles, I was mostly alone! This was disconcerting because it meant that I&amp;rsquo;d have to try to follow the printed map and directions, and avoid getting lost. It would turn out that I would get lost a couple of times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;10th-street-bridge-inbound&#34;&gt;10th Street Bridge, inbound&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving the South Side:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;liberty-bridge-outbound&#34;&gt;Liberty Bridge, outbound&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not having anyone to follow, I got confused about how to get onto the Liberty Bridge, missing the steps, and had to do some backtracking to find the way to get on.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/11-pittsburgh-bridge-crossings/liberty-bridge-outbound.jpg&#34; /&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;On Liberty Bridge outbound&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;to-mount-washington&#34;&gt;To Mount Washington&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This training run featured a big, long uphill to Mount Washington, with a water stop at the very top!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/11-pittsburgh-bridge-crossings/to-mount-washington.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;To Mount Washington&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After being alone for quite some time, I did encounter John and other runners coming back down Mount Washington when I was still going up. They were going really fast downhill!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/11-pittsburgh-bridge-crossings/up-to-mount-washington.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Uphill to Mount Washington&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;second-water-stop&#34;&gt;Second water stop&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My phone started acting funny when I got to the water stop at the top of Mount Washington, so I did not bother to try take any more photos after that. I was bummed that I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a photo of the view of Pittsburgh from the top, but someone did and posted it on Facebook, so here it is:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/602768_422297731198378_798317370_n.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;View from Mount Washington&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At this water stop, at mile 9, I felt hungry, and saw some GU gels, and took one and ate it before continuing my run. It was &lt;a href=&#34;http://guenergy.com/products/products-roctane-gels&#34;&gt;GU Roctane&lt;/a&gt;. I didn&amp;rsquo;t look at the ingredients till after I got home and did a Web search on it. That explained a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While running down from Mount Washington, I felt a surge of energy and decided to run really, really fast, in hope of possibly catching sight of John at some point. In fact, I did not see any runner again for the next 3 miles until I reached the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;back-across-the-liberty-bridge-inbound&#34;&gt;Back across the Liberty Bridge, inbound&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then running through downtown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;16th-street-bridge-outbound&#34;&gt;16th Street Bridge outbound&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was kind of zoned out and missed the turn onto the bridge because I was just running fast, but luckily, I was off by just a block before I realized my mistake and backtracked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-end&#34;&gt;The end&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got back to the start in a bit less than two hours, so given my rest stops and getting lost, I definitely averaged under 10-minute pace. But I was definitely not running anywhere near 9-minute pace. I&amp;rsquo;ll keep that in my mind for the next training run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John had finished well before me, but he himself had gotten lost near the end also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We snacked on provided orange slices and chips:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/11-pittsburgh-bridge-crossings/after.jpg&#34; /&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Steel City Road Runners snacks&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/11-pittsburgh-bridge-crossings/franklin.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then I drove us back to our places. After both of us had showered and changed, we met up for lunch buffet at Coriander India Grill, a favorite place to eat &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/02/26/snowing-means-sambar-at-coriander-india-grill/&#34;&gt;after getting very hungry after a lot of exercise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-next&#34;&gt;What next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week will be an 18-mile training run. As I have mentioned, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/02/24/2013-pittsburgh-marathon-training-progress-since-signing-up-three-weeks-ago/&#34;&gt;I do not intend to actually do such a long run&lt;/a&gt;, so I will think of a good way to run 16 miles instead: either I start walking earlier, or I walk near the end. And for sure, I will start with the 10-minute pace group rather than then 9-minute pace group. These training runs are not races. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to run too fast. In fact, I&amp;rsquo;m worried that I ran the last 3 miles today too fast, especially downhill from Mount Washington. My left knee is feeling a little funny. I hope it will recover after a day of rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve started to figure out the gel thing. I used eat gels a decade ago, but stopped because I had no reason to, but on these long runs, they do help, and I have to start planning what to use for fuel in the Pittsburgh Marathon, which will officially supply GU gel and Gatorade. I did learn, after the fact, that GU Roctane contains an insane amount of caffeine, and that&amp;rsquo;s probably what got me all hopped up to run super fast, but to my detriment today. So I need to be careful if I use Roctane in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a very instructive and tiring training run. I have a long way to go before being ready for the marathon in less than two months, but am happy to have finally joined a group training run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m very grateful for the opportunity to train with the Steel City Road Runners. Sometimes, it is much easier to commit to getting up early and going for a long run when you know that you&amp;rsquo;ll have company, that there will be support (in the form of a planned route and aid stations). Even for an introvert like me who usually prefers to run alone, the unique pains of marathon training cause me to value camaraderie for some tough runs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My first Steel City Road Runners winter 5K race</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/03/03/my-first-steel-city-road-runners-winter-5k-race/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 03 Mar 2013 18:33:03 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/03/03/my-first-steel-city-road-runners-winter-5k-race/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was the first time I ever ran Vibram FiveFingers for a winter race! As planned &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/02/24/2013-pittsburgh-marathon-training-progress-since-signing-up-three-weeks-ago/&#34;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;, I ran in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.steelcityrrc.org/scrrcevents?eventId=620982&amp;amp;EventViewMode=2&amp;amp;CalendarViewType=1&amp;amp;SelectedDate=3/16/2013&#34;&gt;Steel City Road Runners 5K race&lt;/a&gt; to gauge my current fitness level while training for the 2013 Pittsburgh Marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a little disappointed by how &amp;ldquo;slow&amp;rdquo; I ran, but actually, given the amount of training I&amp;rsquo;ve had so far this winter, I&amp;rsquo;m not doing too badly.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/scrrc-5k-2013-03-04/franklin-finish.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin finishing 5K&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(explanation of misleading clock time below)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-route&#34;&gt;The route&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The route was actually kind of a complement to the &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/pretty-good-race/&#34;&gt;Pretty Good Race 5K&lt;/a&gt; course, overlapping the turnaround point of that race but on the same trail in Schenley Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe id=&#34;mapmyfitness_route&#34; src=&#34;http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/embedded/176780548?width=560&amp;height=400&amp;&amp;line_color=7f0000ff&amp;distance_markers=1&amp;map_mode=TERRAIN&#34; height=&#34;420px&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: right; padding-right: 20px;&#34;&gt;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;http://mapmyrun.com/routes/create/&#34;&gt;Create Maps&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;http://mapmyrun.com/routes/&#34;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; from 80 million at &lt;a href=&#34;http://mapmyrun.com&#34;&gt;MapMyRun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;shoes&#34;&gt;Shoes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because there is still some snow (and ice and mud) on the ground in the trails, I wore my &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/08/28/five-reasons-we-just-stocked-up-on-vibram-fivefingers-kso-trek-shoes/&#34;&gt;Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek shoes&lt;/a&gt;. Also, because of the cold temperature and the water on the ground, I wore Injinji socks, to prevent frostbite! For any run longer than a 5K, I would not even wear the FiveFingers with socks at this temperature. But I figured that I would generate enough heat during a 5K to keep my toes sufficiently warm to avoid frostbite even when wet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-race&#34;&gt;The race&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;before-the-race&#34;&gt;Before the race&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I happened to bump into &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/02/20/pittsburgh-chess-club-championship-2013-round-6-winning-as-black-like-a-madman/&#34;&gt;Kurt&lt;/a&gt;, who said he was there because his daughter was running in the race. Pittsburgh is small; I always keep encountering familiar faces in new contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encountered Pattye Stragar, who is so instrumental in the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/02/08/public-shame-a-great-way-to-maintain-a-habit/&#34;&gt;fitness program at CMU&lt;/a&gt;, and in publicizing the Pittsburgh Marathon and the Steel City Road Runners, and notifying the CMU community of the special deal that I ended up taking advantage of. I asked her if she was doing the marathon and she said she did it the year it came back (it was canceled 2004-2008 and came back in 2009) and she was done with marathons.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://pbs.twimg.com/media/BEek8kdCYAAcX2v.jpg:large&#34; /&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;during-the-race&#34;&gt;During the race&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, my feet did get wet, but I did not have any problems with them freezing. Also, although there were some slippery, icy spots and wet, muddy spots on the trails, they were not too bad. After I got home, my shoes and socks looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/scrrc-5k-2013-03-04/vibram-and-injinji.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Shoes and socks afterwards&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The race course was hilly and not so easy, even if it weren&amp;rsquo;t slippery out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After about the first mile, I noticed a guy running around my pace ahead of me. I decided he was going to be my target to beat in the race. There was plenty of time to make up the gap. It turned out that I actually passed him at one point, but later he passed me; I am used to this kind of thing because I tend to run downhills much better than I run uphills. In the final quarter mile or so, I took off and passed him for the last time. You can see him way back in this photo of me crossing the finish line:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/scrrc-5k-2013-03-04/franklin-finish.jpg&#34; /&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin finishing 5K&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;An explanation about the clock: the race was held in two ways, with bib numbers 1-50 arbitrarily assigned to the first wave, then the rest (including me) assigned to the second wave two minutes later, to avoid congestion on the trails. So in fact, my official finish time was 25:11. I&amp;rsquo;d hoped I would be in shape to run faster than that, but this number is important real data to have, in forming my expectations for how fast I might be able to do the Pittsburgh Marathon. I think it is unlikely I&amp;rsquo;ll be in shape to attempt a four-hour marathon in two months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/steelcityrrc&#34;&gt;Steel City Road Runners Facebook site&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.419910474770437.1073741825.391728257588659&amp;amp;type=1&#34;&gt;photo album of the race&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;after-the-race&#34;&gt;After the race&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was water set out for us to drink after the race. Also, bags of potato chips, plates of cookies, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dibellas.com/&#34;&gt;DiBella&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; subs! Tasty and filling!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the Steel City Road Runners for putting on this race, having the people on the course to direct us, and feeding us afterwards! I had a really fun experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;signing-up-for-another-race&#34;&gt;Signing up for another race&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, a couple of days ago I decided to commit to doing &lt;a href=&#34;http://eliterunners.com/just-a-short-run/&#34;&gt;Just A Short Run&lt;/a&gt; in late March. I will be doing the half marathon version of it as a final checkpoint of my fitness before the marathon, which is a month later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be my first half marathon race in nine years: my last half marathon was in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have actually done Just A Short Run four times in my life so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2001: I did the 5K&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2002: I did the half marathon (the course ended up actually a bit long)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2003: I attempted the 30K as part of training for the 2003 Pittsburgh Marathon, but I was very ill and dropped out after running around 13 miles (my only DNF)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2004: I did the 5K&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not know yet whether I will be &lt;em&gt;racing&lt;/em&gt; Just A Short Run or just using it as part of training. &lt;em&gt;Objectively&lt;/em&gt;, I should not be all-out racing such a distance while marathon training, because recovery from racing a half marathon will only cut into valuable marathon training time. However, there may be psychological benefits in doing well in a half marathon, if I am sufficiently fit to attempt that. I will decide when the time is nearer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not doing any other races, because they would interfere with my long run progression plans. I will wait until after the marathon to enjoy training for and running 5K and 10K races. So this year I&amp;rsquo;m going to skip the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.marthadixon.org/&#34;&gt;Martha&amp;rsquo;s Run 10K&lt;/a&gt; that I&amp;rsquo;ve only ever done once (in 2004), as well as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.montourtrail.org/events/displayevent.asp?id=1&#34;&gt;Burgh&amp;rsquo;s Pizza and Wings Pub 10K&lt;/a&gt; that I also did once (in 2004). Since I&amp;rsquo;m not going to be doing the Pittsburgh Marathon again next year, maybe next year I can run these races.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-of-2013-03-30&#34;&gt;(Update of 2013-03-30)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up partially racing Just A Short Run, which I think was the correct decision. I had a &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/03/30/report-on-just-a-short-run-my-first-half-marathon-in-nine-years/&#34;&gt;great experience&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing my first 5K race this year was a confidence booster for me, being a hard workout. It was also an opportunity to start really quantifying my progress and realistic timeline of improvement over the next months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not run in 2014&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.steelcityrrc.org/events?eventId=797046&amp;amp;EventViewMode=EventDetails&#34;&gt;Steel City Road Runners Campus Challenge 5K&lt;/a&gt;, sadly, because I have not been running much this winter, thanks to not signing up for either the Pittsburgh Marathon (or half marathon) or even for the annual CMU Fitness Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2013 Pittsburgh Marathon training progress since signing up three weeks ago: finally coming up with a plan!</title>

      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/02/24/2013-pittsburgh-marathon-training-progress-since-signing-up-three-weeks-ago/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I finally started creating an &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; training plan for myself for the 2013 &lt;a href=&#34;http://pittsburghmarathon.com/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Marathon&lt;/a&gt;, three whole weeks after &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/01/30/why-and-how-i-am-going-to-run-the-2013-pittsburgh-marathon/&#34;&gt;signing up&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why so &lt;em&gt;late&lt;/em&gt; in the game (the marathon is just two months away, basically), and is it too late to start serious training?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-late&#34;&gt;Why late&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My excuse is that life seriously got in the way this February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was out of town for days at &lt;a href=&#34;http://nescala.org/&#34;&gt;NE Scala&lt;/a&gt; [during one week]((/blog/2013/02/10/ne-scala-2013-my-first-scala-conference/). Then immediately after I came back, Abby broke her foot, throwing our lives into considerable disarray for about two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I never actually formulated a marathon training plan until today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-running-status-so-far&#34;&gt;My running status so far&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been tracking my total weekly mileage from Monday through Sunday. I have mostly been trying to build up a base by running slowly, doing only short spurts of faster running to stimulate some strength and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;week-of-february-4&#34;&gt;Week of February 4&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got in only 10 miles, including one session of early morning hotel treadmill running at the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;week-of-february-11&#34;&gt;Week of February 11&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got in 18 miles, while dealing with the situation of Abby&amp;rsquo;s broken foot; long run was 8 miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I skipped the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.steelcityrrc.org/scrrcevents?eventId=619944&amp;amp;EventViewMode=2&amp;amp;CalendarViewType=1&amp;amp;SelectedDate=2/16/2013&#34;&gt;Steel City Road Runners 15-mile Saturday training run&lt;/a&gt; because I simply was not in any shape to run that long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;week-of-february-18&#34;&gt;Week of February 18&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got in 13 miles, while continuing to spend much of time helping Abby; long run was 12 miles (I managed to squeeze in no other running this week besides a 1 mile treadmill run).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I skipped the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.steelcityrrc.org/scrrcevents?eventId=619948&amp;amp;EventViewMode=2&amp;amp;CalendarViewType=1&amp;amp;SelectedDate=2/16/2013&#34;&gt;Steel City Road Runners 10-mile Sunday training run&lt;/a&gt; (it was Sunday because of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://eliterunners.com/spring-thaw/&#34;&gt;Spring Thaw&lt;/a&gt; race on Saturday) because it just didn&amp;rsquo;t fit in my schedule for today, so I did my long run on my own yesterday instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-plan-for-the-pittsburgh-marathon&#34;&gt;The plan for the Pittsburgh Marathon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that Abby and I have adapted sufficiently to her situation and she is regaining mobility, I finally have the time and energy to gather myself and try to figure out how to proceed with marathon training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I casually mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/01/30/why-and-how-i-am-going-to-run-the-2013-pittsburgh-marathon/&#34;&gt;when I signed up&lt;/a&gt; that it would be nice to finish close to the &amp;ldquo;completely arbitrary magic number of 4:00:00&amp;rdquo;. I now believe that is very unlikely, and therefore it is no longer really a goal. My goal is to get enough training in so that I can actually survive the marathon experience without doing too much damage to myself. There is no way I can build up either huge mileage or a lot of fast training in the time that I have left, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to focus on ramping up both bit by bit and monitoring myself, watching out for overtraining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I want to finally start making it to some Steel City Road Runners training runs, in order to better simulate the experience of running with groups of people on roads in the morning, since that will be the situation on race day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;hansons-marathon-method&#34;&gt;Hansons Marathon Method&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan I have created is my own not-enough-time modification of &amp;ldquo;beginner program&amp;rdquo; in &lt;a href=&#34;http://hansonscoachingservices.com/hansons-marathon-method-the-book/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hansons Marathon Method&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, something I&amp;rsquo;ve heard about over the years. The primary &amp;ldquo;renegade&amp;rdquo; idea behind the book is that the super-long-run that is advocated by &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; training programs is not ideal. Sometimes the training philosophy is oversimplified to being about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://hansonscoachingservices.com/hansons-marathon-method-the-16-miler/&#34;&gt;16-mile long run&lt;/a&gt;, but really what it&amp;rsquo;s about is not the number of miles, but the amount of wear and tear on your body during long runs that leaves you less ready to bounce back immediately and continue training. The Hansons method focuses on building &amp;ldquo;cumulative fatigue&amp;rdquo; by avoiding cycles of training so hard that you need a lot of down time. So my focus will be on running more days per week, while keeping more runs shorter and easier, while putting in an honest long run per week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So actually, this is, relatively speaking, a high mileage training method, rather than a low mileage method: instead of doing a whole lot of hard work in fewer days, you spread out the work over more days and run more. So I am in fact deciding to back away from what I thought I would experiment with when I signed up, and I am substituting a different experiment: choosing not to do any long runs of more than about 16 miles (in practice, since the toll on the body is really about time, this means that I don&amp;rsquo;t really want to run for longer than about 2.5 hours in training; it was these kinds of runs that ten years ago really left me worn out).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;schedule&#34;&gt;Schedule&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to run the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.steelcityrrc.org/scrrcevents?eventId=620982&amp;amp;EventViewMode=2&amp;amp;CalendarViewType=1&amp;amp;SelectedDate=2/16/2013&#34;&gt;Steel City Road Runners 5K race in Schenley Park&lt;/a&gt; as a way to gauge my current level of fitness (and also count it as a tempo workout).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also figured out my tentative weekend schedules for the next nine weeks till marathon day, to make sure I can get in the training I need. When training for a marathon, you kind of have to arrange your life around your training! I will be so happy when the marathon is over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we face setbacks of various kinds when trying to achieve some goal. We have to bounce back by adapting: changing up our expectations as well as the details of our plans. The way I&amp;rsquo;ve done this is to go back to my original motivations and priorities and examine how to modify them. It&amp;rsquo;s easier to deal with setbacks when you already decided up front, before the setbacks, what your priorities are. In my case, &lt;em&gt;finish time&lt;/em&gt; was the least of my priorities, and the easiest to let go of.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>An unexpected afternoon tour: 9 miles of running, 1 Cathedral of Learning stair climb, 2 chess tournaments</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/02/02/an-unexpected-afternoon-tour-9-miles-of-running/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 02 Feb 2013 17:41:31 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/02/02/an-unexpected-afternoon-tour-9-miles-of-running/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had an amusing, completely impromptu Saturday afternoon tour in which I ran nine miles (including a couple of miles with a friend I&amp;rsquo;ve never actually seen running before or run with before), did one repetition of the Cathedral of Learning stair climb, and visited two different chess tournaments in Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of Friday evening, I had only planned to go for a run on Saturday. Here&amp;rsquo;s how I ended up on my unexpected tour instead.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/cathedral-of-learning-full.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Cathedral of Learning&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-did-not-run-in-the-morning&#34;&gt;I did not run in the morning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the week, since I had just &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/01/30/why-and-how-i-am-going-to-run-the-2013-pittsburgh-marathon/&#34;&gt;signed up for the 2013 Pittsburgh Marathon&lt;/a&gt;, I had considered to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.steelcityrrc.org/scrrcevents?eventId=582142&amp;amp;EventViewMode=2&amp;amp;CalendarViewType=1&amp;amp;SelectedDate=2/16/2013&#34;&gt;early Saturday morning training run&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.steelcityrrc.org/&#34;&gt;Steel City Road Runners&lt;/a&gt;, but by yesterday, had felt that I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to get up early on Saturday, and also it was going to be very cold, possible as low as 10 degrees F, and I felt more comfortable running near 20 degrees F as well as close to home so that I could bail out during my own long run and get back home and warm if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not run more than 5 miles continuously in a while. I anticipated running at least 7 miles out in the cold, depending on how I felt. I was certain that I would not run as long as 12 miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By afternoon, it was over 20 degrees F, so I felt fairly comfortable going out for an extended run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;chess-tournament-1-a-delayed-pittsburgh-chess-club-championship-round-3-game&#34;&gt;Chess tournament 1: a delayed Pittsburgh Chess Club Championship round 3 game&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, so I was exaggerating: I did not visit two complete chess tournaments on my tour. I did visit the final unplayed game of round 3 in the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/02/04/pittsburgh-chess-club-championship-2013-round-3-attack-defense-and-sacrifices/&#34;&gt;current Pittsburgh Chess Club Championship&lt;/a&gt; that is played Tuesday nights. The game was between Kurt Wallnau and Peter Jansen, and had been postponed because Kurt couldn&amp;rsquo;t make it on Tuesday. This game was important because likely the winner would be my opponent for round 4 on Tuesday, because of my current perfect score of three wins in the first three rounds so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that shortly before I was about to go for a run in the afternoon, I got word from Kurt that he was about to play his rescheduled game with Peter at the Pittsburgh Chess Club. So I thought I would run there from home (just a bit over a mile away) to stop by and take a look before continuing on with my run.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/wallnau-jansen.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Wallnau-Jansen from round 3&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When I arrived, the game had barely begun, so I just immediately went back out to continue running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;chess-tournament-2-2013-pa-state-game-75-championship-http-www-pitt-edu-schach-chesspa-wpastate-htm&#34;&gt;Chess tournament 2: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitt.edu/~schach/ChessPA/wpastate.htm&#34;&gt;2013 PA State Game/75 Championship&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally I had planned to maybe run in Homewood Cemetery for a bit, but I suddenly changed my mind after running for a while and decided to check out the tournament in progress at the William Pitt Union, the 2013 PA State Game/75 Championship. So I ran into Oakland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as I approached, staring me in the face was the Cathedral of Learning.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/cathedral-of-learning-on-run.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Cathedral of Learning&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;cathedral-of-learning-stair-climb&#34;&gt;Cathedral of Learning stair climb&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly I decided that I would do something I had never done before, which was to do the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/01/31/doing-an-unexpected-workout/&#34;&gt;Cathedral of Learning stair climb&lt;/a&gt; right after having run a couple of miles. An interesting circuit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I did one repetition of the 36 floors. I experimented with just continuing to run up the stairs, but quickly found that this was completely unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As another experiment, I did not just sit down and rest after finishing the stair climb. I stayed on my feet and immediately got on the elevator back down and out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went across the street to the chess tournament in progress. The games in the round were mostly done, so there wasn&amp;rsquo;t that much to see:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/2013-pa-state-game-75.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;2013 PA State Game/75 Championship&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;run-with-jason&#34;&gt;Run with Jason&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I ran back to the Pittsburgh Chess Club in Squirrel Hill to see what was going on there. Kurt and Peter had reached a very strange and unclear position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was planning to go back out to run some more before coming back to the club again when I spotted Jason, a chess club regular whom I have known since winter 2005 when he was one of the first people I met, in addition to &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/12/18/round-6-of-pittsburgh-chess-club-tournament-playing-pragmatically/&#34;&gt;Jeff&lt;/a&gt;, during my first visits to the Pittsburgh Chess Club. (He also happens to have started playing in chess tournaments again for the first time in several years!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joked to him, &amp;ldquo;How come you weren&amp;rsquo;t out running with me?&amp;rdquo; and he said that actually, he was about to go out running again, having run &amp;ldquo;a couple of hours&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/01/27/how-to-gut-out-the-tough-workout/&#34;&gt;in Frick Park&lt;/a&gt; in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still amazed that Jason so quickly became an &lt;a href=&#34;http://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Jason&amp;amp;lname=Maruccio&amp;amp;age=36&#34;&gt;ultrarunner&lt;/a&gt;. A couple of years ago we&amp;rsquo;d gone on some hikes together, and he said he was not a runner. After I hiked the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Trail Challenge&lt;/a&gt; three years in a row, he got excited about signing up for the first time. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge/rctc08/volunteers&#34;&gt;Abby and I volunteered&lt;/a&gt; at an aid station for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge/rctc08&#34;&gt;2008 Rachel Carson Trail Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, and greeted Jason as he came through our aid station. Little did I know that he would continue doing not only the Rachel Carson Trail Challenge again and again, but other endurance hikes as well. Eventually, he decided to start running, and he never looked back, and became a full-blown ultrarunner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Jason went out for a run on the roads in Schenley Park for a couple of miles. It was out first ever run together, actually, and the first time I had ever seen him running. (We haven&amp;rsquo;t hiked together in years.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We came back to the chess club, and I saw that the Wallnau-Jansen game was still in a very strange, complex state, and I decided it was time to go home for the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;back-home&#34;&gt;Back home&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my way back home, I started feeling really cold and hungry and tired and sore (despite having eaten a banana and some nuts an hour earlier that I had brought with me). The temperature was still around 25F, not terribly cold, but clearly I had taxed my body with my adventures. My toes were blistering and cramping up because of my footwear (I still have to really solve the problem of what shoes to wear for winter running).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was grateful to get home, eat and stretch, shower, and warm back up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did some calculations and I ran a total of about 9 miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s fun to just go and have unplanned adventures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why and how I am going to run the 2013 Pittsburgh Marathon</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/01/30/why-and-how-i-am-going-to-run-the-2013-pittsburgh-marathon/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Jan 2013 20:31:41 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/01/30/why-and-how-i-am-going-to-run-the-2013-pittsburgh-marathon/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I surprised myself by deciding suddenly to run the &lt;a href=&#34;http://pittsburghmarathon.com/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Marathon&lt;/a&gt; this year, 2013. This was not part of the plan when I was &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/12/31/why-i-went-frick-park-trail-running-in-snowfall-for-the-first-time-in-a-decade/&#34;&gt;thinking about my running plans for 2013 a month ago&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be my second Pittsburgh Marathon, because the last time I ran it was in 2003, and that was my first marathon ever. It was quite an ordeal to finish, because of a lot of rookie mistakes, but I made it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I am in 2003 near the finish line (photo courtesy of my sister Linda):&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/pittsburgh-marathon-2003/P5040055.JPG&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And here I am wearing my medal for finishing in 2003:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/pittsburgh-marathon-2003/P5040061.JPG&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin inside with medal&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So: why am I running the Pittsburgh Marathon again, &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, ten years later? What do I hope to accomplish? And how?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why&#34;&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;do-it-better&#34;&gt;Do it better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2003, I ran my first marathon for a variety of reasons, and trained in certain ways, had certain expectations. I will write in depth later about that first marathon, because one reason I am running the Pittsburgh Marathon again now is to &lt;em&gt;do everything better&lt;/em&gt; this time, with the benefit of experience and new self-knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maintain a smart pace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finish strong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid leg muscle cramping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid foot blistering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conquer the hills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sharp contrast to my first marathon, I do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; plan to race this marathon as fast as I can. That blew up on me, and I do not have the time or desire to maximize my marathon performance at this point in my life. I do want to run strong, but not maximally. So I am not almost certainly not going to run faster than I did ten years ago; I am specifically expecting to run &lt;em&gt;slower&lt;/em&gt; but to have a &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; overall experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will not be the second time I run a marathon distance; I have done that two or three times on my own while training for the &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/rachel-carson-trail-challenge/&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Trail Challenge&lt;/a&gt; and have also run just over a marathon distance in the annual Sammy&amp;rsquo;s Birthday Run (a 6-hour ultra event) in 2006 and 2008. But those I did pretty slowly just for training and fun, in well over four hours. In the 2013 Pittsburgh Marathon, I&amp;rsquo;d like to finish close to the completely arbitrary magic number of 4:00:00. This is very low priority compared to the other goals, but it&amp;rsquo;s useful to have a little bit of ambition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;experiment&#34;&gt;Experiment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides what I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; now that I didn&amp;rsquo;t, there are also things that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know then and still don&amp;rsquo;t know now, but have hypotheses about. So the experience will be an opportunity to test my hypotheses. In particular, the kind of exercise and diet I follow now different in various ways from ten years ago. I do a lot more core and strength training and less endurance training. So my main goal, in fact, is to run this marathon with relatively &lt;em&gt;low mileage&lt;/em&gt;. Instead of spending huge amounts of time and energy banging out the miles in training, I want to try ways of getting in really high-quality training that will enable me to handle the marathon distance better and gut it out through strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;social&#34;&gt;Social&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first Pittsburgh Marathon experience had me running all alone. I did have support as far as my sister coming to town and my friend Nathaniel watching me and cheering me on at certain points along the course, but out there, I was alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, I decided not to do the marathon unless I had at least a friend or two joining me. I got my office mate John to sign up (he also did the marathon over a decade ago). &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.runoverit.com/&#34;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt; is signed up for it, although he actually has yet to run his first marathon, which will be coming up in March. There are a bunch of others I also know who will be running. I guess when time comes, we&amp;rsquo;ll figure out how our likely paces might coincide (or not).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;it-will-be-on-my-birthday&#34;&gt;It will be on my birthday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can I say: it will be my very first race of any distance run &lt;em&gt;on my birthday&lt;/em&gt;. I thought it would be amusing and cool to celebrate my birthday by running the Pittsburgh Marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;discount&#34;&gt;Discount&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As staff at CMU, I (and my office mate John) get a &lt;a href=&#34;http://athletics.cmu.edu/fitness/fitkit2013&#34;&gt;special discount for the Pittsburgh Marathon&lt;/a&gt;. This explains why I registered today, right before the deadline!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the reduced registration fee, part of the deal is &amp;ldquo;Special access to private finish line tent with gourmet food, private massages, and more!&amp;rdquo; as well as 6 months free membership to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.steelcityrrc.org/&#34;&gt;Steel City Road Runners&lt;/a&gt;. Not bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;update-of-2013-03-16&#34;&gt;(Update of 2013-03-16)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should note that the Steel City Road Runners was formed in 2011. John and I had in fact attended its &amp;ldquo;kick-off party&amp;rdquo; on Tuesday, September 13, 2011 where we did a free training run, but we ended up not joining the club or participating further, since we were not planning to do the Pittsburgh Marathon in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how&#34;&gt;How?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;rsquo;t actually much time before the marathon (three months), so I have to be smart about training and try to avoid setbacks. Some things I need to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;immediately start extending the distance of my runs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continue core and strength training&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep up stair climbing and hill running&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build up to some rigorous interval training&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;schedule long races to run in before the marathon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cut back on various commitments in the next three months&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;removing-chess&#34;&gt;Removing chess&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve already decided on one major activity I am going to cut out: after I finish the current Tuesday night chess tournament, the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/02/04/pittsburgh-chess-club-championship-2013-round-3-attack-defense-and-sacrifices/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Chess Club Championship&lt;/a&gt;, I will take a break and not play in any more Tuesday night chess tournaments until possibly the fall (in summer I&amp;rsquo;d rather be playing outside in the sun rather than hunched over a chess board indoors!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time and energy are limited. We can&amp;rsquo;t do everything all the time. In fact, as things are, I have not even been able to play in the monthly &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitt.edu/~schach/ChessPA/ChessLeague/wpapcl.htm&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Chess League&lt;/a&gt; team matches since &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/11/11/pittsburgh-chess-league-round-3-back-to-chess-after-a-month-off/&#34;&gt;November&lt;/a&gt;: in December I was occupied with &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/12/02/oblivion-obsession-time-to-start-playing-melodica/&#34;&gt;music rehearsal&lt;/a&gt;, and just now in January I was coming off a hard week during which I was &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/01/25/notes-on-exercising-while-sick-or-tired/&#34;&gt;sick and overbooked&lt;/a&gt;. I do hope to make it to the February team match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m doing well in the Pittsburgh Chess Club Championship so far, with a perfect score in my first three rounds, so I hope I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to say goodbye while winning it after another three rounds!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;footwear&#34;&gt;Footwear&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost certainly I will wear my &lt;em&gt;worn-out and holey&lt;/em&gt; pair of &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/08/28/five-reasons-we-just-stocked-up-on-vibram-fivefingers-kso-trek-shoes/&#34;&gt;Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek shoes&lt;/a&gt;. The reason is that I have &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; been blistered wearing these shoes, no matter the distance. The leather is really comfortable for me. And I will wear the worn-out pair rather than a newer pair because on the roads, I don&amp;rsquo;t want the deeply lugged outsoles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other alternative I thought about was wearing huaraches such as my &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/09/30/running-my-10th-great-race-10k-obscene-but-in-a-good-way/&#34;&gt;Xero Shoes that I wore in the Great Race 10K&lt;/a&gt;. I will do some experiments in the spring running much longer distances than 10K in huaraches, but I am currently very skeptical about running an entire marathon in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m excited to be back for marathon running. I hope to have a stimulating adventure in the next three months as I train for and participate in the 2013 Pittsburgh Marathon!&lt;/p&gt;
