      <title>Finally making rhubarb tasty to myself: flour-less rhubarb crisp</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the first forty years of my life, I believe I never ate any rhubarb. At least, I don&amp;rsquo;t ever recall anything identified as rhubarb that I ate. It was just something I heard about, in the context of pie, and I rarely eat pies, and am rather particular about pie when I do eat it (for example, I have sometimes eaten pumpkin pie, because my father likes it, but I never once really enjoyed it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Krestschmann Farm box subscription has always recognized that some people don&amp;rsquo;t like rhubarb, and allows opting out of receiving it. Since I never ate it, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know whether I liked it, but looking up its description online, I felt no need to try it, so I always indicated that I did not want it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was the first time I cooked rhubarb and made something that I actually enjoyed eating. Here&amp;rsquo;s the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-first-time-cooking-rhubarb-was-a-disaster&#34;&gt;My first time cooking rhubarb was a disaster&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost exactly a year ago, Abby and I accidentally did not specify rhubarb exclusion from our farm box (upon renewing our subscription). So we received rhubarb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what the heck to do with it. I decided to make an Indian-style lentil dish and &amp;ldquo;hide&amp;rdquo; rhubarb in it. At first I thought it was OK, but then I decided it was weird. Unfortunately, I had to finish the whole batch. Abby didn&amp;rsquo;t help me finish it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rhubarb-lentils-2013-06-10.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Rhubarb lentils&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;abby-s-experiment-didn-t-work-for-me&#34;&gt;Abby&amp;rsquo;s experiment didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby also tried an experiment, cooking rhubarb with banana on the stove. The resulting concoction caused an argument, because after trying it, I refused to eat any more of it, but she had made a huge batch and so she was stuck with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-experiment-today&#34;&gt;My experiment today&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I decided that instead of randomly making crap up, I would look for some kind of &amp;ldquo;recipe&amp;rdquo;, and also incorporate the advice of friends from last year. The following is what I made. I found it surprisingly edible, and even had to stop myself from eating too much after dinner:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rhubarb-2014-06-09.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Rhubarb crisp&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My ingredients:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coconut oil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rhubarb, chopped up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Honey (I tried to go easy with this!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cinnamon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orange zest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lemon juice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cocoa powder (a tiny sprinkle, just an improvisation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raw walnuts and pecans, chopped&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preheat oven to 350 degrees F, layer the nuts on top of the remainder of the mixture, and bake for 40 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone who offered suggestions to me last year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result was fairly tart, which is fine, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to put too much sugar into this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-next&#34;&gt;What next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was planning to notify Kretschmann Farm that we don&amp;rsquo;t want to receive rhubarb, but I have second thoughts now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, we will probably go ahead as planned and put rhubarb on our &amp;ldquo;do not want&amp;rdquo; list, simply because we&amp;rsquo;d rather get other stuff instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-learned&#34;&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned some lessons from this whole rhubarb incident:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can learn to &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2014/03/21/time-to-taste-the-world-thoughts-on-expanding-my-food-tastes-as-an-adult/&#34;&gt;like stuff I never ate for decades&lt;/a&gt;, if I prepare it just so. (More generally, I try to continuously find opportunities to &lt;a href=&#34;http://sivers.org/hate&#34;&gt;love what I used to hate&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is wise to listen to accumulated wisdom, especially from my friends (whose taste might be correlated a bit with mine).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accidentally &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; choosing to opt out of my &amp;ldquo;default&amp;rdquo; preference led to some interesting experiences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the latest food you feared or hated or didn&amp;rsquo;t know about that you recently tried? How did it go? If it went poorly, will you try again, or just write it off?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
