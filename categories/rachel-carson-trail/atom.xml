      <title>My Rachel Carson Trail hike for the year (13.4 miles): and how this is about love and gratitude</title>

      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/05/12/my-rachel-carson-trail-hike-for-the-year/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I did my first hike of the year (normally I would have done hiking already in the spring, but the combination of Abby&amp;rsquo;s broken foot and my Pittsburgh Marathon training this year resulted in no space for hiking until after the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/05/06/2013-pittsburgh-marathon-my-135th-race-was-my-worst-i-finished/&#34;&gt;marathon, which I did seven days ago&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first hike of the year just happened to turn out to be a grueling Rachel Carson Trail hike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, I reported on the two Rachel Carson Trail Challenge goal training hikes I did in &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/04/29/a-pretty-rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-hike/&#34;&gt;late April&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/06/03/a-totally-exhausting-rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-hike/&#34;&gt;early June&lt;/a&gt;. This year, I did the fourth of eight of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge/rctc13/goaltraining&#34;&gt;year&amp;rsquo;s goal training hikes&lt;/a&gt; offered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sunday, May 12&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leader: Donna Stolz 412-303-6102, Eileen Lessman 412-760-8863&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;13.4 miles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elevation change: 5055 ft&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This hike begins in North Park and heads over to Emmerling Park, then up and over Rich Hill and Lefever Hill. We end at the Log Cabin Road checkpoint location. Meet at Log Cabin Road parking area. Take Route 28 to Exit #12. Turn right at the end of the ramp, then right at the stop sign onto Little Deer Creek Road (aka Russellton Road). Travel about 1.5 miles and turn right on Log Cabin Road. Park about 100 yards ahead on the right.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of this year, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to do &lt;em&gt;only one&lt;/em&gt; Rachel Carson Trail hike a year, so this was it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my report on the hike, as well as my long-awaited explanation of why this trail means so much to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;weather&#34;&gt;Weather&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conditions were good. It was kind of chilly and windy, probably 45-50 degrees throughout the hike. The sun came and went. There were only short periods of light drizzling rain, thankfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;footwear&#34;&gt;Footwear&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek shoes I wore last year on the Rachel Carson Trail developed holes, as a result of which I &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/08/28/five-reasons-we-just-stocked-up-on-vibram-fivefingers-kso-trek-shoes/&#34;&gt;stocked up on some new ones&lt;/a&gt;. The pair that I opened, I&amp;rsquo;ve worn only a couple of times, and I wore this pair today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;comparison-with-last-year-s-hike&#34;&gt;Comparison with last year&amp;rsquo;s hike&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/06/03/a-totally-exhausting-rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-hike/&#34;&gt;Last year on the 18.1 mile hike&lt;/a&gt;, I was stupid about my smartphone, and this year I was smarter. Today&amp;rsquo;s hike was a shorter 13.4, so I was sure the battery would last long enough, if I didn&amp;rsquo;t take photos with flash. And of course, I always have a phone charge in my car now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year&amp;rsquo;s hike went east to west and ended in North Park. This year&amp;rsquo;s hike went west to east and started in North Park. But being shorter, it did not end in Springdale. It is really a different hike when you go on the same trail but in a different direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might enjoy comparing the photos in different directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;meeting-up-at-log-cabin-road&#34;&gt;Meeting up at Log Cabin Road&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John and I arrived on time but not early, which meant that when we arrived, we saw a whole contingent of people already carpooling to head to North Park. We never saw those people again. Oops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, although we were ready to go with the hike leader, Donna, latecomers kept on showing up, and we were lenient and waited for them, before all the rest of us remaining headed to North Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waiting for latecomers:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.03.20.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Because of Route 910 closures, some detours were necessary as Donna&amp;rsquo;s husband drove us to North Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hike&#34;&gt;Hike&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In North Park about to begin:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.45.23.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.45.26.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;By the time we started, there were only a handful of us together as a group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was momentarily confused because I saw someone running in the &lt;em&gt;wrong direction&lt;/em&gt; on the trail and thought she might be one of us, and was worried. I tried to follow her to call out to her, but she disappeared quickly:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.45.34.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Donna called out to me, and I rejoined the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In North Park, a few sections of the trail are on the road, but then we go into the woods for real:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.51.43.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.51.49.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.52.15.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a whole bunch of stream crossings while in North Park. Some of them are easier than others. I should note that one of the harder ones had some fast water and basically ensured that your feet would get wet, because the logs were floating and not completely safe to step on. Some people jumped, but that&amp;rsquo;s not safe. Wearing KSO Trek shoes, since the temperature was around 50, I was fine just getting my feet wet by walking through the water.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.05.16.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.05.22.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.10.50.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.10.56.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Out of the woods onto the railroad tracks (note that hiking in the reverse direction is tricky because it&amp;rsquo;s not well-marked where to get off the railroad tracks into the woods; John and I got lost the last time we did the reverse hike and had to backtrack!).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.18.50.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.19.23.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a good amount of road walking on this section of the Rachel Carson Trail.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.27.01.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.27.14.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.29.46.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.53.40.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Crossing Route 8:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.03.01.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally, the power lines:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.04.28.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.05.59.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.22.47.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I am a bit sentimental about this section of trail in Hampton Park because Abby and I have done some cross country skiing here in winter, when she used to live up here before we got married and she moved to Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.29.52.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Abby and I have also hung out here in the past watching birds.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.32.38.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.37.55.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.41.13.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.48.38.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.49.37.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.54.37.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here is where John and I got lost. I was distracted by this sight and made a turn toward it (the trail turned in the opposite direction) to check it out:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.55.25.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;OK, &amp;ldquo;acidic condensate collection tank&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.56.02.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Hmm, this didn&amp;rsquo;t look familiar.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.57.12.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_11.05.31.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;John and I turned back. We lost about ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_11.06.42.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_11.07.38.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_11.15.12.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_11.18.16.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;No animals out and about today!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_11.41.38.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_11.43.09.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Funny how this happens to me once or twice each hike:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.01.43.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What the heck is this going on?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.07.33.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Uphill.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.07.53.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.11.35.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.19.47.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally at Emmerling Park, about 3 hours and 45 minutes into the hike.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.28.15.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I hung out at Emmerling Park for about ten or fifteen minutes, using the restroom and then playing on the swing relieving my aching feet while waiting for John and the others to catch up and also use the restroom. The truth is, I was ready to stop hiking already, feeling tired. I was also sore because of two falls I had sustained earlier in the hike. One of the falls involved my tripping on my right foot, causing me to land hard on my left, reinjuring my left knee that I had hurt before the marathon in a fall down the stairs. My left knee was causing me serious pain again now in the hike. I also fell on a steep downhill earlier, landing directly on my butt and on the palm of my left hand, which reinjured my left elbow. Finally, my right Achilles was killing me, because I had not adjusted the strap of my shoe properly; I had readjusted it during the hike, but the damage was already done. I was quite ready to stop hiking, but there were still two hours to go! Oops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Red flower:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.49.45.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.49.54.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And now we got to sections of the trail that are abused by ATVs and rutted and muddy. (We ended up encountering someone on an ATV, in fact.)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_13.02.18.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Standing water:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_13.05.17.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally back to the parking lot!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_14.25.11.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;after&#34;&gt;After&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hiked something like 5 hours and 45 minutes. It felt really long to us, as our first hike of the year. My feet were killing me. I was happy to take my shoes off and drive us back home barefoot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, my phone still barely had battery power left when we finished. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure it would have lasted another hour. This is useful to know. Of course, I immediately plugged it into my car charger! I should get an extra battery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-hike-this-trail-at-all&#34;&gt;Why hike this trail at all?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby is confused why I like occasionally (once or twice a year) hiking on the Rachel Carson Trail, even though much of the time I find it tiring and weird. I&amp;rsquo;ve never fully explained this in words, so here, finally, is my explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have many sentimental reasons to hike this trail. One is that eight years ago, in late May of 2005, when a local running friend said he was doing the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge/rctc05&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Trail Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, I had taken an entire half year off from running was feeling sad and lonely. I looked up the Challenge online, and happened to find that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge/rctc05/training&#34;&gt;training hikes led by Barb Peterson&lt;/a&gt; were being offered in just a few days, and although I had no intention whatsoever to do the Challenge, I thought the training hikes would be a fun way to do and see something different. After doing the third of four, I was so excited by the novelty that I ended up signing up for the Challenge!! With only three weeks left, there was not much training I could do for it, but I figured that if I just took it slowly, I should be able to finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2005 Challenge was an ordeal for me to finish, but I did, and the side effect was that I fell in love with hiking in general. I met people through doing the Challenge, and in 2006 I roped John into joining me on some longer training hikes, where we met more people, and some of them I began hiking with outside the context of the Challenge, in places like the Laurel Highlands. This was before the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/pittsburghhikers/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Hiking Meetup&lt;/a&gt; was formed in May 2007 and made it much easier to find people to hike with. So the 2005 Challenge had the side effect of getting me into making hiking a regular part of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, as I was training for the 2007 Challenge, that was the time when I had just met Abby and was dancing with her, but we were not dating yet. When we were chatting at a salsa dance, I learned that she liked to hike and was intrigued. I invited her to join me and John for an April 29 Rachel Carson Trail Challenge training hike that happened to be passing through Hampton (as today&amp;rsquo;s hike did), and she said she would join us for part of it. A comic series of events then took place, in which John and I arrived at Hampton earlier than she had expected, so she had not yet made it to Hampton to meet up with us. When I paused to call her, and she said she would meet us in the trail, John and I got confused and lost because of miscommunication. I kept having to call her again and again until we finally found her, and she set us straight back onto the trail and hiked with us for a bit before turning back. That was my first interaction with Abby outside of dancing; I got to see how she gracefully handled my clumsy mistakes during this outing and how helpful she was. It was a month after that when we finally started dating. Eventually, I proposed right after a hike led by one of the guys I originally first met through a Rachel Carson Trail Challenge training hike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I associate the Rachel Carson Trail not only with falling in love with hiking, and with meeting lots of interesting people I still hike with all these years later, but also I am reminded of how I fell in love with Abby and how hiking is a big part of what we have done and do. It is slightly ironic, of course, that she does not enjoy doing most sections of the Rachel Carson Trail, so in recent years I have been hiking it either alone or with John. And that is why I try to limit how often I hike on the trail; I&amp;rsquo;ve decided now to do it only once a year, so that I spend less time on hiking that Abby doesn&amp;rsquo;t do with me, in order to share more hiking with her. But I would like to spend good time on the trail once a year from now on to remember what it means to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, despite the strange hybrid nature of the trail, I believe in its existence and maintenance. It is a reminder that even in urban/suburban environments, there is still an underlying primitive nature that we can enjoy. The volunteers of the Rachel Carson Trails Conservancy work hard to keep this unusual resource open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/03/11/fascinating-bushwhacking-hike-at-pa-state-game-land-51-dunbar/&#34;&gt;Example from March 2012 of the kind of hike that Abby and I have enjoyed doing.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rachel Carson Trail will always have a special place in my heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Donna for keeping us company for most of the hike as trail sweep, and her husband for driving us to the start!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Five reasons we just stocked up on Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek shoes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/85802484@N06/7858001266&#34; title=&#34;&amp;quot;Run Around the Square&amp;quot;, Regent Square by sherpes39, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7253/7858001266_58020e37f8.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;375&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;Run Around the Square&amp;quot;, Regent Square&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby and I just stocked up on Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek shoes: we got &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; brand new pairs for me and &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; for her as well. Why the extravagant purchases? Here are five reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reason-1-trail-running&#34;&gt;Reason 1: trail running&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2010, I bought my first pair of KSO Trek shoes, primarily for the purpose of trail running, since I was sick and tired of the knee and shin and blistering problems I seemed to have whenever trail running extensively in any regular shoes, and I wanted more durability and protection against rocks than I got from running in less built-up racing flats meant for road running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I had bought the KSO shoes earlier, but they just weren&amp;rsquo;t, for me, suitable for much trail running, because of blistering issues and lack of protection (later, as I got used to more minimalist running, the protection no longer became an issue, but the blistering remained, so the last time I did trail running in the KSO shoes as a test was in June for &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/06/06/i-celebrated-national-running-day-in-schenley-park-remembering-how-i-began-to-run-13-year-ago/&#34;&gt;National Running Day&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a little bit of breaking in, during which I had a few blisters, &lt;em&gt;I never got blistered again, for two years and counting&lt;/em&gt;. The kangaroo leather is very nice and quickly seems to conform to your feet and becomes smooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have never run in the trails with my old regular monotoed running shoes again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have never experienced knee or shin problems again when trail running.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reason-2-hiking&#34;&gt;Reason 2: hiking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, I resisted the idea of wearing the KSO Trek hiking, because my typical hike involves terrain considerably rougher than my local trail runs, and goes on for more hours. But a year ago, in August 2011, following the lead of Abby, who started hiking in her Trek Sport shoes (which are similar to the KSO Trek in protection but are not made of kangaroo leather), I finally shed my &amp;ldquo;trail running&amp;rdquo; shoes that I had been hiking in, reluctantly, for several years (even though I always ended up with some knee/shin/calf/ankle/foot pain/soreness and some blistering on long hikes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;starting-out-with-6-miles&#34;&gt;Starting out with 6 miles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first KSO Trek hiking experience was on a hike that was only 6 miles long. But that experience was a revelation. I had &lt;em&gt;no problems&lt;/em&gt; at all during the hike. I just had some tightness in my right shin after that hike, undoubtedly due to imperfect form. But no blistering, and no lasting foot soreness. As a result, &lt;em&gt;I have never hiked again in regular monotoed shoes, but only in KSO Trek shoes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;moving-up-to-20-miles&#34;&gt;Moving up to 20 miles&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/kso-trek/rachel-carson-trail.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;On the Rachel Carson Trail&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This May, I decided I wanted to really put the KSO Trek to the test. I wore the shoes on my most extreme hike of this year, a 20-mile training hike on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://rachelcarsontrails.org/rct&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Trail&lt;/a&gt;. I finished the hike with no blisters whatsoever, no knee pain. Yes, my feet were sore as heck after all the banging on rocks and tree roots and down the hills, but foot soreness always happened anyway whenever I did a 20-mile hike on the Rachel Carson Trail in any footwear. The interesting thing is that I recovered from this foot soreness extremely quickly, much more quickly than I ever recovered from foot soreness wearing more padded shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I cannot answer the fascinating question of whether I could do the 35-mile &lt;a href=&#34;http://rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Trail Challenge&lt;/a&gt; in KSO Trek shoes. I have completed the Challenge three times, each time with a different pair of regular monotoed trail running shoes, and each time with leg and foot issues (including severe blisters). The reason I cannot answer the question is that my feet were noticeably &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; sore after 20 miles on the trail in KSO Trek than they ever were in the regular shoes. There might be a problem with scalability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;injinji-socks&#34;&gt;Injinji socks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, earlier, in March, I had gone on a really tough hilly, bushwhacking exploratory hike that was about 10 miles long, and worn Injinji toe socks with my KSO Trek shoes. The socks provided additional protection that completely removed foot soreness. Unfortunately, I simply did not enjoy the extra bulk around my toes, and therefore have chosen not to wear socks again except when necessary in cold weather. But it is certainly conceivable that with socks, 35 miles on the Rachel Carson might be doable with KSO Trek shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-recent-hike&#34;&gt;A recent hike&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby and I enjoyed &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.trails.com/tcatalog_trail.aspx?trailid=HGS212-001&#34;&gt;Atalaya Mountain&lt;/a&gt; in Santa Fe this month when we were in New Mexico. She wore her Trek Sport, I wore my KSO Trek.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/kso-trek/atalaya-abby.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Abby with Trek Sport&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/kso-trek/atalaya-franklin.jpg&#34; /&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin with KSO Trek&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;reason-3-paddling&#34;&gt;Reason 3: paddling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point, Abby and I decided to start wearing Vibram FiveFingers shoes kayaking. I started off wearing the KSO, but then realized that wearing the KSO Trek offered a lot of advantages with no down side. Being thicker and leather, they protected better against being under the sun. The extra protection when stepping out into the water and onto rocky shores was also welcome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rio-grande-paddling.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Kayaking down the Rio Grande&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Down the Rio Grande in New Mexico, with view of Sandia Crest.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;no-shoe-funk&#34;&gt;No shoe funk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://birthdayshoes.com/the-definitive-guide-to-cleaning-vibram-five-fingers-a-k-a-how-to-get-the-smell-out-of-your-vibrams&#34;&gt;infamous problem that the synthetic Vibram shoes tend to end up stinking&lt;/a&gt; after getting wet, even after washing! Abby and I found no perfect solution to this problem. It turns out that the leather shoes don&amp;rsquo;t suffer from this problem &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;. All I have to do is rinse the shoes thoroughly (without even any soap or detergent), air dry them, and then they are just fine. Believe it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reason-4-holes-in-my-toes-after-two-years-and-over-a-thousand-miles&#34;&gt;Reason 4: holes in my toes after two years and over a thousand miles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;discovering-holes-on-vulcan&#34;&gt;Discovering holes on Vulcan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know when holes started forming in my KSO Trek shoes from 2010, because I did not have a habit of checking regularly for holes. I only know that I started feeling the ground with my toes only after a particular outing during which I spent over an hour running the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nps.gov/petr/planyourvisit/volcanoes.htm&#34;&gt;three Petroglyph volcanoes&lt;/a&gt; near Albuquerque this month.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/kso-trek/petroglyph-volcanoes.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Panorama of Petroglyph volcanoes&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/kso-trek/franklin-petroglyph-volcanoes.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin getting ready to run the volcanoes&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I was fairly high up on Vulcan and descending when I first noticed the sensations of volcanic rock rubbing on my bare toe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Here&amp;rsquo;s Abby hiking toward Vulcan after I had already run down and was headed the other way.)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/kso-trek/abby-hiking-to-vulcan.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Abby hiking to Vulcan&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;examining-the-holes&#34;&gt;Examining the holes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the holes, which occurred at the sides of the second toes of both my feet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/kso-trek/hole-in-left.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Hole in left shoe&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/kso-trek/hole-in-right.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Hole in right shoe&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Abby and I ordered and received our new shoes (Abby decided to finally also go for KSO Treks, after seeing how much I loved them in the past two years), I took some photos to illustrate the wear and tear:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/kso-trek/old-and-new.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the old shoes are pretty worn down:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to retire the old shoes yet, of course. I kind of like that they have, through being worn down, become more minimalist; feeling a little bit of dirt touch my toes once in a while is no problem at all (especially given my experiments with entirely barefoot running). I expect to continue to wear the old shoes for years to come; I did just start wearing a new pair (which &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/08/25/my-eighth-time-doing-run-around-the-square-5k/&#34;&gt;I just ran a race in and Abby also&lt;/a&gt;, but will come up with a rotation system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reason-5-vibram-is-discontinuing-the-kso-trek-shoes-and-they-are-on-sale&#34;&gt;Reason 5: Vibram is discontinuing the KSO Trek shoes and they are on sale!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the unbelievable news: Vibram is discontinuing the KSO Trek, my favorite shoe!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a sale is going on right now: we picked up four pairs at a clearance price, and so can you &lt;a href=&#34;http://birthdayshoes.com/labor-day-minimalist-barefoot-sales&#34;&gt;before they disappear for good&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very sad that Vibram is discontinuing the shoe that I have happily put well over a thousand miles on trail running, hiking, and paddling. I hope that by stocking up, I will be able to enjoy the KSO Trek for several years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A totally exhausting Rachel Carson Trail Challenge goal training hike (18.1 miles</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/06/03/a-totally-exhausting-rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-hike/</link>

      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/06/03/a-totally-exhausting-rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-hike/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In April, I reported on a nice &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/04/29/a-pretty-rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-hike/&#34;&gt;8.9 mile hike on the Rachel Carson Trail&lt;/a&gt; I did with John, the second of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge/rctc12/goaltraining&#34;&gt;eight goal training hikes for the Rachel Carson Trail Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. I looked forward to doing a really long hike on the Rachel Carson Trail with John as my last hike on this trail for the year, and today was the one opportunity I had (during a very busy spring and summer weekend schedule) to get it in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The description of today&amp;rsquo;s hike, the seventh of eight:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sunday, June 3, 2012&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leader: Craig Fowler 412-491-6643&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;18.1 miles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elevation change: 6915 ft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;On this hike we&amp;rsquo;ll cover the second half of this year&amp;rsquo;s Challenge course. Starting in Springdale near the Springdale Veterans Association Hall, we&amp;rsquo;ll hike through Springdale then hit Log Cabin hill, Lefever Hill, and Rich Hill. Then we&amp;rsquo;ll stick the landing in North Park. Meet at the Harmar Shelter in North Park. Directions: Take I279 north to the McKnight Road exit and travel 6.4 miles north. Take the North Park/Ingomar Rd. exit east and turn right at the third traffic light onto Babcock Blvd., then take the next left onto Hemlock Drive, then left again into the swimming pool lot. Follow the perimeter drive all the way back and bear right. The Harmar Shelter is ahead on the left, behind the guardrail.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that a lot of things went wrong during this hike, but we survived!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;volunteering&#34;&gt;Volunteering&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the season, there had been a call for volunteers to lead or assist in the goal training hikes. I felt like giving back to the Rachel Carson Trail community, but didn&amp;rsquo;t feel ready yet to actually lead a hike. Instead, I accepted the role of helping (with John) by assisting in one of the longer ones, serving as trail sweeps in the back, aiding Miranda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;footwear&#34;&gt;Footwear&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to do a very long hike as a test of whether my feet could hold up in Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek shoes, on tough terrain as well as a very long distance. I always had problems (toe jamming, blistering, knee and ankle pain) wearing trail running shoes in the past hiking the Rachel Carson Trail in previous years when going about 20 miles or longer. In April&amp;rsquo;s Rachel Carson Trail hike, my feet got sore but otherwise I felt great. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how things would scale up to a much longer distance. So this was an opportunity to test my limits in FiveFingers shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;camera&#34;&gt;Camera&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/03/22/paradox-i-will-observe-the-national-day-of-unplugging-but-just-bought-my-first-smartphone-this-week/&#34;&gt;I have a smartphone, finally&lt;/a&gt;, I no longer have to lug around the bulky digital camera that I&amp;rsquo;ve had to use for the past couple of years for taking photos. So I decided to bring just the phone for this hike. On the April hike, my new phone&amp;rsquo;s camera had been dead for days (I ended up getting a replacement phone, whew!), so I had used John&amp;rsquo;s camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;meeting-up-at-north-park&#34;&gt;Meeting up at North Park&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John and I had a weird carpooling arrangement to get to North Park. Only John and I were hiking, but Abby needed to be up in the vicinity to visit her parents and pick up her car that they had, so we all went together. Abby dropped us off, the idea being that her parents were going to stop by North Park later in the morning to give her car back so that she could drive back home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parked at Harmar Shelter:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_08.11.20.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;hike&#34;&gt;Hike&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took quite a while to ride back in a carpool to Springdale for the start. That just made us think of how long it would take to hike back to North Park!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I am, ready to start hiking:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_08.52.05.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Denser and higher greenery in June than a month ago:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_09.00.53.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Years ago, when I did the Rachel Carson Trail Challenge, the trail in Springdale went through a section of land called the &amp;ldquo;roller coaster&amp;rdquo;. Sadly, in recent years, because of problems landowners had with misbehaving hikers, they revoked the permission they had given for so long to go through their land. This force some rerouting of the trail through the streets of Springdale. Ironically, the rerouting resulted in the trail finally actually passing by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://rachel_carson_homestead.myupsite.com/&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Homestead&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_09.15.03.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some dirt road hiking:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_09.22.15.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A critter!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_09.26.37.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Butterfly:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_09.32.10.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Inevitable road walking, part of the whole Rachel Carson Trail experience:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_10.14.12.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Up:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_10.20.34.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Nice view into the distance:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_10.23.54.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_10.27.49.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_10.32.43.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now descending toward the road:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_10.35.29.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Looking back toward John:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_10.37.49.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the woods:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_10.45.23.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the &amp;ldquo;Rachel Carson Trail&amp;rdquo; signs, yellow on brown:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_10.52.30.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Back to road:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_11.08.39.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Dirt road:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_11.17.59.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Big descent coming up; you can see how there will be a valley:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_11.19.29.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_11.23.27.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The thing to remember is that after getting to the bottom, the trail does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; go back up. It actually makes a left.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_11.23.33.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_11.26.37.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the woods again:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_11.43.49.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_11.58.15.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Stream crossing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_12.30.28.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_12.31.41.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very convenient that the trail passes through Emmerling Park, because you can get water from the fountain and use the restrooms here before going on.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_12.39.41.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;An unpleasant section of high-speed road with no sidewalk:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_13.15.13.jpg&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Looking like it might rain:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_15.14.01.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2012-06-03/2012-06-03_15.18.08.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;oops&#34;&gt;Oops&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, at this point, six and a half hours into a very long hike, my phone&amp;rsquo;s battery ran out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a problem because John and I had gotten separated from anyone else for some time already, and I worried about not being able to communicate with the hike leaders, whose responsibility it was to make sure everyone was accounted for at the end of the hike. Craig had my phone number, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t call him and he couldn&amp;rsquo;t call me. Nor could I call Abby to let her know when John and I were done and heading home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;finishing-the-hike&#34;&gt;Finishing the hike&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made it to North Park, but then &lt;em&gt;got lost&lt;/em&gt; in the trails. I had route maps on my phone, but my phone was dead. &lt;em&gt;Luckily&lt;/em&gt;, I had brought some paper printouts of some road maps of North Park (but no trail maps!!). As long as we got out of the woods and onto the roads, I was sure we would find the shelter and my car and be OK. At worst, there would be people around in North Park we could ask for more detailed directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it began to rain. Really hard. My paper maps were getting blurry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We eventually got to a road, and asked random people where the Harmar Shelter was, but they didn&amp;rsquo;t know. After some wandering around, we finally figured out where we were on the printed maps I had (the rain had stopped), and backtracked toward the shelter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then all of a sudden, John pointed at a car and said, &amp;ldquo;That car looks a lot like yours!&amp;rdquo; I replied that a lot of cars looked like mine, and ignored him. But then he noticed some distinguishing features and said it looked like it actually was mine. We were lucky, because it turned out the car was mine!! (Later I would learn from Abby that she had moved the car from where it had been parked in front of the shelter, to some random place further away, and texted me about the move, but of course, since I had not been checking my phone during the hike, and it died, I had no idea.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we made a note of where the car was before heading to the shelter. We saw no trace of Craig or Miranda. Oh great. Since Abby had moved the car, Craig must have left without waiting for us to return because he saw our car gone and assumed we had returned faster and had already gone home! (Later it would turn out that he had texted me as well as left voice mail asking me where I was and then after not getting a reply said he was leaving because he assumed we had finished.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shelter had a big, noisy party going on. We asked some random drunk guy if we could borrow his cell phone to make a call. He was kind enough to lend us the phone, and I called Craig (I was so fortunate that I had written in pen Craig&amp;rsquo;s number on one of the pieces of paper I had on me during the hike), and cleared up the confusion over whether we had finished or gone home. Then I called Abby and let her know John and I were OK, and drove us home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;after&#34;&gt;After&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was very happy to have made it home, and ate a ton of food. I noticed that my toes were numb, from all the hiking and the cold of stream crossing and rain. Also, my ankles were very stiff. The soles of my feet were quite sore. But I had no other leg soreness. So the experiment with footwear partially succeeded. (The numb toes were OK again after a couple of hours.) But still, I cannot imagine hiking more than 20 miles comfortably with the Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek. My feet were simply very sore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-learned&#34;&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned many lessons during this exhausting hike:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trail sweep can be a lonely, arduous task. I&amp;rsquo;m used to hiking with a pack of people, or at least having a pack in sight. Not being the fastest hikers on this hike, being the sweep meant actually being left behind!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am immediately buying a phone charger for my car. It would have saved a lot of trouble if I had been able to charge my phone upon reaching it, in order to access missed text messages and voice mail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; going to completely rely on the phone again for directions or maps. I will always have backup paper printouts of all important information, and in fact, put them in plastic bags in case of rain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will turn off automatic flash in order to save the phone battery when taking photos. Also, turn off unnecessary apps, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The FiveFingers shoes didn&amp;rsquo;t work too badly, but for a truly long distance are not cushioned enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the final hours, John and I simply were no longer enjoying the hike, but just wanted to finish. We don&amp;rsquo;t really want to do a hike this long or grueling again. We did about 20 miles today (extra distance beyond 18.1 because of getting lost in various places). &lt;em&gt;Never again&lt;/em&gt; do I want to hike this long on the Rachel Carson Trail. In 2005, 2006, and 2007, I did the full 34-mile Challenge just to prove I could, not because I actually enjoyed it as such. I don&amp;rsquo;t need to kill myself any more. I enjoy doing long, varied, meditative hikes, but there is a limit to how much I actually enjoy. 8 or 9 miles, as in the hike a month ago, is probably optimal for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew that this Rachel Carson Trail hike was going to be tough, but it got a lot tougher than I expected. I learned a lot as a result of the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Craig for checking up on us and leading the hike and Miranda for being with us on the sweep during the beginning, and thanks to Abby for taking us to the hike!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A pretty Rachel Carson Trail Challenge goal training hike (8.9 miles)</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/04/29/a-pretty-rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-hike/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 29 Apr 2012 23:22:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/04/29/a-pretty-rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-hike/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every spring, I like to do one or two of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge/rctc12/goaltraining&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Trail Challenge goal training hikes&lt;/a&gt; for fun even though I no longer do the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge/&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Trail Challenge&lt;/a&gt; because three times was enough for me. Since this year&amp;rsquo;s Challenge proceeds east to west, all of the goal training hikes this year also go east to west.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The description of today&amp;rsquo;s hike, the second of eight that increase in length till the longest one in June:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sunday, April 29, 2012&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leader: Brian Droz 412-848-4810&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8.9 miles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elevation change: 4925 ft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;On this hike we start at the Bull Creek Road checkpoint location in Tarentum and quickly encounter a steep uphill climb followed by even steeper ups and downs - including Crawford Run hill and Murray Hill. We pass through Agan Park and end in Springdale. Meet at the Springdale Veterans Association Hall parking lot in Springdale. Directions: Take Route 28 to Exit #11 (Harmarville). After exiting onto Route 910 head towards Harmarville, turn left at the second traffic light onto Freeport Road and travel about 4 miles through 9 more traffic lights. The Springdale Veterans Association Hall entrance will be on your left just past the last light. Park on the far side of the lot.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;meeting-up&#34;&gt;Meeting up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John and I drove up to the meeting place in Springdale. It was a cold morning!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m wearing my Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek shoes as I have been doing for some time now for all my hiking.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/franklin-cold.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin ready to hike&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Note: since Abby was elsewhere this morning using our camera, and my brand new smartphone&amp;rsquo;s camera had died and I was waiting for a replacement phone, John and I used his camera to take photos during the hike.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the tower that will serve as the landmark when hiking back here:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/landmark.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;hike&#34;&gt;Hike&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we carpooled to the Bull Creek Road checkpoint in Tarentum further north and east.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The start of the hike from this checkpoint is by Route 28:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/bull-creek-start.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I let John go ahead so that I could stay back and take photos without holding up anyone behind me:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/john-start.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now John has his camera back and took a photo of me going up:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/franklin-going-up.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Closeup of some garlic mustard:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/garlic-mustard-flowering.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally in the woods:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/in-the-woods.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A horse!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/horse.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A phone tower; these things prove to be useful landmarks:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/phone-tower.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A descent along a power line:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/descent.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the season for May apples:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/may-apple.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Going down and up, which is what the Rachel Carson Trail in this section is about:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/go-down-go-up.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Allegheny River is visible:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/view-of-allegeny-river.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/allegheny-river.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Emerging onto a road section of the this urban trail:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/emerging-to-road.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Stream crossing:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/stream-crossing.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/rachel-carson-trail-sign.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Looking back after finishing my very steep descent:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/very-steep-descent.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Trillium:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/trillium.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Ah, the power line experience:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/following-power-lines.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s two hours since we started hiking, and getting warmer, so my shell and hat and gloves are off. I&amp;rsquo;m wearing my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge/rctc06&#34;&gt;2006 Rachel Carson Trail Challenge&lt;/a&gt; T-shirt:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/franklin-in-rachel-carson-trail-challenge-2006-shirt.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Down and up:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/big-down-and-up.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I get things stuck between my big toe and my second toe:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/stuck-between-toes-of-kso-trek.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the less pleasant aspects of the Rachel Carson Trail is the road sections, where there is no sidewalk and the speed limit is 40 mph or higher!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/scary-road-walking.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now we&amp;rsquo;re really by the Allegheny River:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/allegheny-river-1.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/allegheny-river-2.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Red flowers (sorry, I don&amp;rsquo;t know much about flowers and do not know what they are):&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/flower.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The home stretch! See the tower that I mentioned as a landmark before the hike?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/home-stretch.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Back to the landmark:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-2/back-to-landmark.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The 8.9 hike took about 3:20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed doing my first Rachel Carson Trail hike of the year. Earlier in the year is better because the hikes are shorter and the weather is cooler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Brian Droz for leading this hike!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reflections on 2011</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/12/31/reflections-on-2011/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2011 18:52:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/12/31/reflections-on-2011/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I reflect on my year of 2011 as it ends. Since I did not start blogging until September, I go into more detail of what happened before then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;january&#34;&gt;January&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I continued our project of massively reorganizing our home, a project that began when she moved in during summer 2010. We were very grateful that Abby&amp;rsquo;s father helped out a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I continued getting rid of a lot of stuff, including another eighteen boxes of my books, as I became an initially reluctant &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/minimalism/&#34;&gt;minimalist&lt;/a&gt;. We sold or gave away a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; number of various of belongings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby started cooking much more than in the past, and we enjoyed trying new dishes of her making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I enjoyed some light cross-country skiing in the winter, using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schenley_Park_Golf_Course&#34;&gt;Bob O&amp;rsquo;Connor Golf Course at Schenley Park&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I began a weekly Zen &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/meditation/&#34;&gt;meditation&lt;/a&gt; session offered at Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started moving very gradually toward a &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/paleo/&#34;&gt;paleo&lt;/a&gt; diet and exercise routine, and immediately experienced benefits. &amp;ldquo;The Paleo Solution&amp;rdquo; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://robbwolf.com/&#34;&gt;Robb Wolf&lt;/a&gt; was very useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started learning modern &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/javascript/&#34;&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; for a new project at work, getting into client-side Web development. As part of that, I learned &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/jquery/&#34;&gt;jQuery&lt;/a&gt; through a free &lt;a href=&#34;http://p2pu.org/&#34;&gt;P2PU&lt;/a&gt; course and used it in the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started using &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XQuery&#34;&gt;XQuery&lt;/a&gt; at work to process XML in a clear and concise way. I had used XSLT in the past, but it was very unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decided, for various reasons, to stop writing new &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/perl/&#34;&gt;Perl&lt;/a&gt; scripts and move to &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/python/&#34;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started playing in my final (and disastrous) &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/chess/&#34;&gt;chess&lt;/a&gt; tournament, the Pittsburgh Chess Club Championship (which I had won in 2006 and 2007).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;february&#34;&gt;February&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pittsburgh was all about the Steelers, and I went to a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLV&#34;&gt;Super Bowl&lt;/a&gt; party for the first time, but we lost!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I read &amp;ldquo;The Art of Non-Conformity&amp;rdquo; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://chrisguillebeau.com/&#34;&gt;Chris Guillebeau&lt;/a&gt; and found it so inspiring that I decided to take action and start making big changes to my life, in my own way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One big change: I quit playing chess, cold turkey, after having been unenthusiastic about it for months already (and playing correspondingly poorly). When the passion and enjoyment are gone, there is no point in hanging onto something just because it has been such an important part of my life for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of not playing any music at all, I started playing &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/recorder/&#34;&gt;recorder&lt;/a&gt;, and vowed to play every single day if possible. Ten months later, I am still playing recorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I began attending a lot of &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/16/pittsburgh-software-developer-communities/&#34;&gt;local software developer group meetings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started learning the &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/scala/&#34;&gt;Scala&lt;/a&gt; programming language and decided to use it on a small project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;march&#34;&gt;March&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I continued our meditation practice at CMU, and went to our first mini-&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesshin&#34;&gt;sesshin&lt;/a&gt; on a Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I continued practicing recorder every single day, and joined the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/lukas/pcars/Welcome.html&#34;&gt;local chapter of the American Recorder Society&lt;/a&gt;. It was very exciting to meet new people and to get into a wide range of music I had never really listened to or played.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I saw a video of &lt;a href=&#34;http://jakeshimabukuro.com/&#34;&gt;Jake Shimabukuro&lt;/a&gt; playing &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/ukulele/&#34;&gt;ukulele&lt;/a&gt; so beautifully that I was inspired to buy a ukulele and start learning to play it. (Unfortunately, it would turn out that time constraints caused me not to pursue ukulele far. This will change in 2012.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got pulled into the Ruby programming language because it is well-supported on Mac OS and it is easy to install libraries and tools, of which there are many that are quite useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I went to &lt;a href=&#34;http://farmtotablepa.com/&#34;&gt;Farm to Table&lt;/a&gt; in Pittsburgh, and after that, Abby started moving toward paleo eating, with even better results than my smaller experiments earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I started our &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/hiking/&#34;&gt;hiking&lt;/a&gt; season in the spring. Hiking is special to us; it was one of our first shared activities (after initially meeting during salsa dancing), and one we return to again and again. When there is no calendar conflict and the weather is acceptable, we like hiking almost every weekend from spring through fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% img /images/steves-soup-hike-2011-03-26.jpg Abby in front of me at Steve&amp;rsquo;s Soup Hike %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;april&#34;&gt;April&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started wearing &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/fivefingers/&#34;&gt;Vibram FiveFingers shoes&lt;/a&gt; almost all the time, whether walking or running (but not yet for hiking).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I went to &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/yoga/&#34;&gt;yoga&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.clpgh.org/locations/squirrelhill/&#34;&gt;Squirrel Hill Library&lt;/a&gt; for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;may&#34;&gt;May&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I began my experiment with barefoot running, in observation of &lt;a href=&#34;http://barefootrunners.org/ibrd&#34;&gt;International Barefoot Running Day&lt;/a&gt;. I started walking around barefoot at work, ignoring the confused looks or comments of colleagues. (I still go barefoot at work.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I bought a &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/melodica/&#34;&gt;melodica&lt;/a&gt;, inspired by the amazing performances of &lt;a href=&#34;http://jnote.org/&#34;&gt;James Howard Young&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I took a little vacation, spending some days in New York visiting Nathaniel and Yael and their baby. I finally fulfilled my dream (from before marriage) of taking Abby to Coney Island to walk on the boardwalk and at the beach, eating pizza, and riding the Wonder Wheel, just as I once did when I was six years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I started doing research into major home renovations for the summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I visited my parents, and my sister Linda and her husband Andre also visited, with my mother throwing a delayed reception at home for the both of us who had gotten married in the past two years. Abby got to meet my parents&amp;rsquo; friends, finally. And I went running with my brother-in-law for the first time! Also, I took Abby to the little park in Ann Arbor where as a too-shy teenager I used to go and sit on a particular bench and wish I were sitting with my dream girl. Mission accomplished!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;june&#34;&gt;June&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John and I did a tough 19-mile training hike on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Trail&lt;/a&gt; and decided we&amp;rsquo;d had enough of that trail, and I decided I was probably not going to do the 35-mile &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Trail Challenge&lt;/a&gt; again (having completed it three times in the past).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% img /images/rachel-carson-trail-2011-06-05.jpg John on Rachel Carson Trail %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby started wearing Vibram FiveFingers more and more for walking and running, and even walking barefoot on the streets (something I had not yet seriously done myself at the time).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stupidly threw out my back during exercise, and my back took weeks to fully recover (I could still run and hike, but not lift weights). Never again, I hope. I felt like a 90-year-old when my back was hurting constantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We started some home improvement projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;july&#34;&gt;July&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started gravitating to almost exclusively body weight &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/strength-training/&#34;&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt;, as a reaction to my having injured my back earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I went kayaking on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiskiminetas_River&#34;&gt;Kiski River&lt;/a&gt; with &amp;ldquo;Fireman Steve&amp;rdquo; and the kayaking gang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a longish hike, Abby surprised me by wearing Vibram FiveFingers shoes and they worked great for her, making her much faster and less sore, and I made a note to ditch my trail running shoes (which I had been using for years for hiking) in favor of FiveFingers for my next hike (which I did, and I have not gone back to regular shoes for hiking!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I finally took Abby to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sandhillberries.com/&#34;&gt;Sand Hill Berries&lt;/a&gt; for tasty pie for the first time, always having intended to take her there when dating, but never having been in the vicinity with her then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major home renovation finally began, after much research, and we got electrical upgrade, insulation, and bathroom demolition and rebuilding. Very disruptive to our lives for weeks!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I did another mini-&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesshin&#34;&gt;sesshin&lt;/a&gt; at CMU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a lifetime of almost never drinking coffee (average of maybe three or four cups a year), I became an avid espresso fan (one small cup a day) as a result of my boss getting a machine at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started doing more barefoot running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;august&#34;&gt;August&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bathroom renovation done at last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I were regularly hiking in Vibram FiveFingers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% img /images/abby-franklin-soup-hike-vibram.jpg Abby and Franklin on Steve&amp;rsquo;s Soup Hike part 3 wearing Vibram FiveFingers %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby joined me to run in her first ever 5K race, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.runaroundthesquare.com/&#34;&gt;Run Around the Square&lt;/a&gt; in Regent Square (mostly on the trails of Frick Park). What a special day! This race was my first ever 5K race when I started running in races in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started to learn &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/accordion/&#34;&gt;accordion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;september&#34;&gt;September&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started running to work two or three times a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I ran in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kalp/PGR/&#34;&gt;CMU SCS Pretty Good Race 5K&lt;/a&gt; together, her second 5K race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I went to &lt;a href=&#34;http://podcamppittsburgh.com/&#34;&gt;PodCamp Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;, and after that, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/09/22/starting-a-new-web-site/&#34;&gt;I started this blog&lt;/a&gt; and proceeded to maintain a habit of posting every day (a routine that has been modified since then).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;october&#34;&gt;October&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started expanding beyond just writing for my blog, and began contributing to the Web through &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/franklinchen&#34;&gt;my Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; as well as writing comments on other people&amp;rsquo;s blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started taking Stanford online classes: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ml-class.org/&#34;&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.db-class.org/&#34;&gt;Introduction to Databases&lt;/a&gt;. (Blog posts on my experiences to appear soon.) Unfortunately, as a result of the extra time commitment, October through December were quite hectic for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby and I continued to move more toward a paleo diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;november&#34;&gt;November&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started playing &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/flute/&#34;&gt;flute&lt;/a&gt; again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably because of fatigue and a compromised immune system, I came down with a skin ailment that I got serious treatment for, but it took almost two months to completely clear up and I spent over a month truly miserable &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;december&#34;&gt;December&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started playing Baroque flute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started playing tin whistle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I prepared for and made it through two music performances, playing recorder and flute (and almost tin whistle).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ended the year completely exhausted, on the verge of getting sick, and took a long break from blogging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final week, Abby and I were on a hectic travel schedule that involved meeting up with her parents, my parents, her sister Carrie, Carrie&amp;rsquo;s boyfriend Alain, Alain&amp;rsquo;s parents, Alain&amp;rsquo;s extended family, my sister Linda, and her husband Andre. I am grateful that we got to meet up with so many people (and arranged for various of the individuals to meet up with various of the others!), but the trip was quite stressful to me, because I was not physically or emotionally prepared for it at all. (I will report later on what I learned from the experience.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2011 was quite a year for me and Abby. We had many changes and adventures in our lives: our home, our diet, our exercise, our outdoors activities, travel. For me, the biggest changes were quitting chess, starting music practice and performance, throwing myself into blogging and tweeting, getting more and more active in local software developer groups, applying new (to me) development tools at work, and in the fall, taking Stanford online courses in computer science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I ended the year in poor shape, because of being overbooked, I am very excited by how many positive changes took place. I have an entirely new set of plans and priorities to formulate soon for 2012 in collaboration with Abby, in hope of learning from the lessons of my failures and omissions of 2011, and restoring balance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
