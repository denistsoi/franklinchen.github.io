      <title>Discovering the Eolina, a beautiful musical instrument</title>

      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2015/02/18/discovering-the-eolina-a-beautiful-musical-instrument/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just discovered a musical instrument that was new to me, the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melodicaworld.com/post_reviews/ballone-burini-eolina-45/&#34;&gt;Eolina&lt;/a&gt;,
which has a surprisingly beautiful sound, given that it is a form of
melodica, which although a perfectly fine instrument I enjoy playing,
does not have the loveliest, most refined sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encountered the Eolina through my following the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/user/GerardvanR&#34;&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; of Gerard
van Reenen, who is just some random musician I found on YouTube at some
point in the past couple of years through some music search that I
have now completely forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His specialty is playing duets with himself, by playing a wind
instrument with one hand while accompanying himself on a
keyboard instrument. Remarkably, he often makes this work quite well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what exactly is an Eolina, and what does it sound like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;example-a-handel-sonata-performed-on-eolina-and-organ&#34;&gt;Example: a Handel sonata performed on Eolina and organ&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out Gerard van Reenen&amp;rsquo;s self-duet on Eolina and organ of George
Frideric Handel&amp;rsquo;s sonata in B-flat major, HWV 377. I really like this
performance, showcasing his musicality on both instruments, and the
expressiveness of the Eolina, which is an upscale melodica made of
wood rather than plastic and therefore has more subtlety and
smoothness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zNvV5WXRP1Q&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;another-example&#34;&gt;Another example&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was so curious about the Eolina that I tried to find other uses of
it on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some musicians performing Piazzolla&amp;rsquo;s tango &amp;ldquo;Oblivion&amp;rdquo;, with
one of them playing an Eolina:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34;
src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/U0h39B6blVE&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;
allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Over two years ago,
&lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/12/02/oblivion-obsession-time-to-start-playing-melodica/&#34;&gt;I had attempted to play &amp;ldquo;Oblivion&amp;rdquo; on my cheap melodica&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;d
love to have access to an Eolina sometime!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always enjoy discovering a new musical instrument, and the Eolina
counts as one, even if it is just a wooden melodica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Had you heard of or heard an Eolina before you read this blog post?
  What do you think of the sound? What do you think of melodicas in
  general? They are not so commonly used except as teaching
  instruments for children, so does that affect your perception?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Celebrating two years of playing recorder</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/02/23/celebrating-two-years-of-playing-recorder/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I was very excited to celebrate two years of playing recorder by attending the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/lukas/pcars/Welcome.html&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Recorder Society&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;Midwinter Musical Feast&amp;rdquo; potluck and informal recital at Helen&amp;rsquo;s. Last year (2012) we didn&amp;rsquo;t have a winter party, but I still remember when two years ago (2011), on February 19, I started learning the alto recorder at home by myself, and then &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/09/26/i-dont-feel-like-practicing-but-im-gonna-do-it-anyway/&#34;&gt;decided to join the Pittsburgh Recorder Society&lt;/a&gt;. Helen was actually my first email contact from the group, and she had immediately invited me to come to the Midwinter Musical Feast, but not having actually met anybody yet, and also barely just beginning to play recorder, I was too intimidated and decided to skip the party and instead practice for two weeks before attending my first meeting of the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last recorder potluck/recital I went to was &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/07/28/my-first-appearance-on-a-music-recital-program/&#34;&gt;half a year ago&lt;/a&gt;, when I played a bit on soprano recorder, Baroque flute, and modern flute. Abby had come with me, and her parents also attended. This time, Abby came again, as did her parents, and Abby brought her &lt;a href=&#34;tambura&#34;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamburica&lt;/a&gt; to play some Balkan music selections:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Abby on tamburitza&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Additional photos of food and people are now &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.445931198818142.1073741825.330712777006652&amp;amp;type=3&#34;&gt;up on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-two-collaborations&#34;&gt;My two collaborations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for me, I prepared two pieces to play, both of which required a continuo accompanist. Because of time constraints, I did not actually get together with either of my collaborators, but did send them sound files of myself playing at home, as well as scores. So we never had any rehearsal together, but heck, this was just a party, so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a big deal that we were going to wing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;handel-s-recorder-sonata-in-g-minor&#34;&gt;Handel&amp;rsquo;s recorder sonata in G minor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month, I ran through Handel&amp;rsquo;s short four-movement recorder sonata in G minor &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/01/26/music-i-just-played-for-the-first-time-recorder-sonata-tangos/&#34;&gt;with Henry on piano at a party&lt;/a&gt;, but my goal was always to perform it for real, to the best of my technical and interpretive ability, with period accompaniment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually rehearsed this with Annie, with her playing my portable electronic keyboard that has a harpsichord setting, but then it turned out she could not make it to the party, so I scrambled to find someone else, and I was thankful that Mike agreed to step in and play the continuo on bass recorder!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked rather hard on this piece, actually, in the sense of coming up with some fluency to be able to come up with spontaneous and personally expressive Baroque ornamentation in all the movements, especially the first. (I did not want to compose a fixed ornamentation to play.) I believe I had some success doing so, and felt that my effort was a respectful way to celebrate two years of recorder playing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Two months ago, I had actually run through this piece on Baroque flute with piano accompaniment &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/12/22/playing-tango-on-melodica-and-singing-christmas-carols/&#34;&gt;at a party&lt;/a&gt;, but just sight read by Henry on piano and in a noisy environment that was not ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, I actually worked on playing it in a quiet environment. Karen Parsons, whom I actually formally met just before &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/07/21/mideast-early-music-workshop-a-life-changing-experience/&#34;&gt;last year&amp;rsquo;s Mideast early music workshop&lt;/a&gt;, which we both participated in, was kind enough to agree to play the continuo part on viola da gamba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a false start and a scare though! What happened was that I had planned to play the piece on Annie&amp;rsquo;s wooden Baroque flute that she had lent to me, and I had in fact practiced it on this instrument just fine for days, but somehow, I could not make a sound at all on her flute after I performed the Handel recorder sonata. I was completely mystified. Luckily, I had a backup plan: I had brought along my own plastic Aulos Baroque flute, and I was perfectly able to play it instead, and so we proceeded. I am still not entirely certain why Annie&amp;rsquo;s flute suddenly failed to work for me; upon arriving at the party, I had actually warmed up the flute and played a few notes on it for confidence. My speculation is that it was a mistake to play recorder right before flute, and maybe my embouchure was slightly off on the particular instrument I had only been playing for a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Karen and I had fun playing this light, elegant piece. I do wish I could have played it on Annie&amp;rsquo;s flute, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-people&#34;&gt;Other people&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed hearing others in the recorder group playing their musical selections as well, especially those who were newer to the group. It makes me profoundly happy to be among others sharing music together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pittsburgh Recorder Society usually holds these potluck/recitals twice a year, in winter and summer. I always cherish the opportunity to make a special dish to share for the potluck (this time I brought my own hearty vegetable soup) as well as prepare interesting music to share that I hope others will enjoy. And this time, being basically the second anniversary of my playing recorder, I felt especially grateful for all that everyone in the group has shared with me in the past two years! I actually do not know what my life would be like today if I had not begun playing music with the Pittsburgh Recorder Society two years ago. It changed everything for me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Music I just played for the first time: recorder sonata, tangos</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/01/26/music-i-just-played-for-the-first-time-recorder-sonata-tangos/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abby and I went to Henry&amp;rsquo;s birthday party, marking an important anniversary: we attended his birthday party for the first time a year ago, and that began &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/01/27/a-new-friends-very-musical-birthday-party-changed-my-life/&#34;&gt;one of the most important developments in my entire life, my decision to make music playing an integral part of my life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of music happened, as usual, and this time, unlike a year ago, I played. What a year it&amp;rsquo;s been!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;handel-s-recorder-sonata-in-g-minor&#34;&gt;Handel&amp;rsquo;s recorder sonata in G minor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to finally give a shot at playing, for the first time outside of home, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recorder_sonata_in_G_minor_%28HWV_360%29&#34;&gt;Handel&amp;rsquo;s recorder sonata in G minor, op. 1 no. 2&lt;/a&gt;, me being on alto recorder and Henry on piano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This piece is extremely special to me, because I discovered it by accident as one of the first &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; recorder pieces that I started working on when I was just a beginner at recorder. A method book I was using at the time, one and half years ago, in May 2011, by Mario Duschenes, had a section with the title &amp;ldquo;How to practise a difficult piece&amp;rdquo;, and the example and suggestions on practice was the Andante from this recorder sonata by Handel. I hunted down the complete score of the recorder sonata and started to learn the whole thing. I did this intermittently over the course of a year or so while doing other things, but always had the intention of at some point polishing it up for actual performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main holdup eventually was that I wanted to be able to really express myself well, and incorporate my own ornamentations. To this end, I made some study of Baroque ornamentation and checked out a book I found in the library, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Music/PerformanceStudiesAppliedMusic/WindsBrass/?view=usa&amp;amp;ci=9780198790013&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Playing Recorder Sonatas&amp;rdquo;, by Anthony Rowland-Jones&lt;/a&gt;. I have found this book quite useful as a guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I had fun reading through this with Henry. Eventually I want to play it for real, as performance, in a setting with harpsichord continuo, rather than with piano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-of-2013-02-23&#34;&gt;(Update of 2013-02-23)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up performing the recorder sonata with bass recorder accompaniment at the Pittsburgh Recorder Society&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/02/23/celebrating-two-years-of-playing-recorder/&#34;&gt;Midwinter Musical Feast&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;bach-s-flute-sonata-in-e-minor-bwv-1034&#34;&gt;Bach&amp;rsquo;s flute sonata in E minor, BWV 1034&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I played music by Johann Sebastian Bach on flute for the first time outside the home. I&amp;rsquo;ve held back because I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m still not doing the music justice, but decided I can&amp;rsquo;t hide forever my love of Bach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On modern flute with Henry on piano, I played the first movement of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonata_in_E_minor_for_flute_or_recorder_and_basso_continuo&#34;&gt;Bach&amp;rsquo;s flute sonata in E minor&lt;/a&gt;. I would have considered playing it on Baroque flute, but the piano as well as the the party environment &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/09/21/my-first-time-singing-bossa-nova-also-a-temporary-farewell-to-baroque-flute/&#34;&gt;is not friendly for Baroque flute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-of-2013-03-21&#34;&gt;(Update of 2013-03-21)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Bach&amp;rsquo;s birthday in 2013, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/03/21/my-second-year-of-celebrating-johann-sebastian-bachs-birthday/&#34;&gt;I reflected on&lt;/a&gt; how the very same recorder method book by Duschenes I mentioned above was the impetus for my getting into Bach flute sonatas!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tangos&#34;&gt;Tangos&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I played tango on flute for the first time ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/11/17/a-childhood-dream-come-true-i-am-now-finally-singing-for-real/&#34;&gt;sing tango for the first time recently&lt;/a&gt;, and also played &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/12/22/playing-tango-on-melodica-and-singing-christmas-carols/&#34;&gt;tango on melodica for the first time&lt;/a&gt;, but had not yet dared to play on flute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I did, and not only that, one of them ended up becoming a flute-violin duet, in which Barbara (whom I met exactly a year ago at the last birthday party) played violin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story is that several months ago, in October, I got hold of a book of tangos for violin duet. I judged that with some modifications I could play the first part on flute, if only I could simultaneously find someone on violin (and someone on piano). The opportunity did not spontaneously arise until today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I played &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Choclo&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;El Choclo&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; with just Henry on piano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Barbara joined in on violin and we played &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Por_una_Cabeza&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Por una Cabeza&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; with Henry. This was one of the most satisfying experiences of my life. It&amp;rsquo;s one thing playing duets with Henry, but it&amp;rsquo;s another having three to really fill in the harmonies and textures and two melodic voices playing off each other. Wow. I need to do this more often. And I have to confess, I never tire of this particular classic tango, because it&amp;rsquo;s so dramatic and expressive, and has that suddenly shift from major to the lyrical chorus in minor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-bach-double-violin-concerto&#34;&gt;More Bach: double violin concerto&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barbara was so excited that she goaded me into trying to sight read &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concerto_for_Two_Violins_%28Bach%29&#34;&gt;Bach&amp;rsquo;s double violin concerto&lt;/a&gt; on the spot together with Henry. I knew I was probably going to cause a minor disaster, but heck, it&amp;rsquo;s a party, we&amp;rsquo;re just having fun. And indeed, I got confused or lost many times, because first of all, I&amp;rsquo;m not so great on flute right now at all, and second, this music was for violin and some stuff was not very suitable for flute and also needed me to go up an octave all of a sudden because the violin has a bigger range. So, it was a struggle for me, but I enjoyed some nice moments in the less frantic slow movement, where the two melodic voices really combine beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it was all in fun, Bach forgive me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As at all of Henry&amp;rsquo;s parties, I strive to go to them prepared to do something better and new and interesting musically, for our enjoyment as well as that of the other guests. I had a great time again. I am so grateful for the past year of getting to know Henry and his sharing the gift of music with me!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/09/16/excited-by-the-new-season-of-the-pittsburgh-recorder-society/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was the first meeting of the new season (September-May) of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/lukas/pcars/Welcome.html&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh chapter of the American Recorder Society&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/PittsburghRecorderSociety&#34;&gt;on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;). I was excited to be back, since the last time I actually played recorder at all was a month and a half ago at a &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/07/28/my-first-appearance-on-a-music-recital-program/&#34;&gt;potluck/recital&lt;/a&gt;; I&amp;rsquo;ve been focused recently on playing &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/baroque-flute/&#34;&gt;Baroque flute&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/flute/&#34;&gt;modern flute&lt;/a&gt;, with a tiny bit of &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/piano/&#34;&gt;restarting piano&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a new plan this season!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-new-plan-for-this-season&#34;&gt;A new plan for this season&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our director, Fred, told us of a new plan for this season, geared toward working toward pieces that we will actually perform in a concert as a complete ensemble. Last season we didn&amp;rsquo;t end up having a concert, for example. This year, his plan is to include work on music that has two choirs of voices, to make it easier for more people to be involved and also in order to make performance possible even if someone for some reason is not available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-music-we-worked-on-today&#34;&gt;The music we worked on today&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we started working on the meditative &amp;ldquo;Kyrie de la &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missa_Papae_Marcelli&#34;&gt;Missa Papae Marcelli&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; by Palestrina (1562), and the joyful &amp;ldquo;Jubilate Deo&amp;rdquo; by Lodovico Viadana (1600s?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Palestrina is gorgeous music and I am excited about our working toward play it beautifully as a unified ensemble:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/IIcrgNtyX0U&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also started work on &amp;ldquo;Jubilate Deo&amp;rdquo;, which is divided into two choirs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/qrtxRkXRz5Y&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;stuff-someone-donated-to-us&#34;&gt;Stuff someone donated to us&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone donated a whole bunch of music to us and even some instruments. Here are the scores I picked up (there were plenty left over that others did not pick up, but I resisted the temptation to take more than I was ever going to work on):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baroque stuff, Handel, Telemann, sopranino &amp;ldquo;bird&amp;rdquo; tunes, old English airs and dances, a three volume set of &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/07/28/my-first-appearance-on-a-music-recital-program&#34;&gt;Van Eyck&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;music-or-chess&#34;&gt;Music or chess?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until today, I was not entirely sure whether I was going to make it to the recorder society meeting! Today happened to also be the first round of the new season of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitt.edu/~schach/ChessPA/ChessLeague/wpapcl.htm&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Chess League&lt;/a&gt;, and recently &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/08/21/returning-to-chess/&#34;&gt;I committed to&lt;/a&gt; being an alternate player for a team playing in it. My understanding was that, being an alternate player, I would not often be depended on by our team to always be available to play, but because our top two boards were not going to play today, and I did not plan to play, we had to go as far down the list as our third and final alternate player. This meant that if something went wrong, we would have a forfeit. So I told the team captain that in case of emergency, I could play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All things being equal, I prioritize music in my life over chess, but I would have gone to play for the team to avoid a forfeit if that had been required today. But it turned out that because of the odd number of teams in our division, our team got a bye today, so that was perfect timing: I went to the recorder society meeting knowing that there was no conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;trying-to-recruiting-someone-from-chess-into-music&#34;&gt;Trying to recruiting someone from chess into music&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By coincidence, yesterday when &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/09/15/deja-vu-in-chess-recognize-this-sicilian-pattern/&#34;&gt;I was at the chess club and ended up playing blitz&lt;/a&gt;, I ran into a fellow chess player I hadn&amp;rsquo;t talked with in years, and we were talking about the Pittsburgh Chess League and I mentioned that I didn&amp;rsquo;t intend to play chess today because I was going to play music instead. In the course of conversation, it turned out that he had just bought himself a recorder and was just starting to play it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told him he should join the Pittsburgh Recorder Society, and that there were great beginner lessons before the general playing begins: &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/18/disagreement-on-the-use-of-time/&#34;&gt;over a year ago I had gone to these lessons by Fred&lt;/a&gt; and learned quite a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, he ended up not showing up today; it turned out that instead playing chess as an alternate for a team. I&amp;rsquo;ve reminded him that there are no more conflicts with chess in the upcoming months, so I hope to see him playing recorder in October! I will personally remind him again when the next meeting grows near. (Peter, if you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, please consider joining us!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s good to be playing recorder in an ensemble again. And I hope to bring in more people to the Pittsburgh Recorder Society, including beginners.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
