      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abby and I went on our first hike at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.coopersrockstateforest.com/&#34;&gt;Coopers Rock State Forest&lt;/a&gt;, joining a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/pittsburghhikers/events/169497262&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh hiking meetup event&lt;/a&gt; led by Terri and Jeff. This is a regularly held hike that we simply never got around to in previous years because of schedule conflicts or other circumstances, so we were delighted to have the opportunity to go this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d only been to Coopers Rock once, as part of a rock climbing trip, which turned out to be an embarrassing disaster for me, because after climbing only a few minutes, I decided the whole thing just made me nervous, and I sat out the rest of the day. But I was there long enough to see how beautiful the area was, and knew I wanted to go back just to hike, not to climb!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-there&#34;&gt;Getting there&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drive from Pittsburgh took just over an hour and a half; we took the most direct, shortest route involving taking route 51 south. (We returned instead by way of Morgantown, the long route that uses I-79, but this was a huge mistake because of traffic as we neared Pittsburgh. I don&amp;rsquo;t see any reason to take this longer route in the future, since it doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually save any time even if there had not been congestion on the highways.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby and I took John and Courtney, since each of them also live in Squirrel Hill, in our car to carpool together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;parking&#34;&gt;Parking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out, as I suspected, that parking is quite scarce in the main Coopers Rock parking lot. Now that spring is here, this is prime season for people to be visiting, of course. We arrived early enough to grab the very last spot, actually, in the main parking lot. There are other parking spaces further out, but even those were not plentiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;weather&#34;&gt;Weather&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was always a chance of rain. We completely lucked out, because it didn&amp;rsquo;t start raining until after we&amp;rsquo;d completed the main hike. Then it was pouring. Pouring rain would have made the hike far less pleasant, because of the rocks and mud, but part of the experience of hiking is taking whatever nature gives us, in all humility and gratitude. We head out in the morning not knowing exactly what to expect. Sometimes the forecast the day before a planned hike looks pretty bad, in which case Abby and I might choose to cancel, but we tend not to cancel that often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;photos&#34;&gt;Photos&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a member of the Pittsburgh meetup group, you can see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/pittsburghhikers/photos/21676842/&#34;&gt;photos people took&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-hike&#34;&gt;The hike&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forecast for the day was supposed to be temperatures in the 60s and 70s F in the middle of the day. In the morning at 10 AM, however, it started out rather cool, temperature possibly in the high 30s. I was glad I packed a winter hat and gloves, just in case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around thirty people showed up for the group hike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terri had her trail map ready, accompanied by Jeff who acted as the sweep. By the way, this hike is part of an extended camping weekend that they organize, running from Friday through Sunday, so many of the hikers had already camped one night, and many planned to camp another night. Abby and I did not feel ready to do camping yet this year, so we went just for the hike.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/coopers-rock-2014-05-03/terri-and-jeff.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Before we started the hike proper, we checked out the main overlook. It&amp;rsquo;s beautiful. You can see Cheat River and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/coopers-rock-2014-05-03/overlook.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/coopers-rock-2014-05-03/overlook2.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;heading-down&#34;&gt;Heading down&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main hike was an out (mostly down, all the way to the river) and back up, roughly 7 miles. This is not very far at all, but given the terrain and significant elevation change, as well as waiting for everyone (since it was a large group), it took a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of rhododendron around:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/coopers-rock-2014-05-03/rhododendron.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There were also many little wildflowers along the trails during the hike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took the rocky, Rattlesnake Trail winding along cliffs. By the way, &lt;strong&gt;using a pair of hiking poles&lt;/strong&gt; during the entire hike made things much easier. Both Abby and I used a pair of hiking poles as well as Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek shoes (which prompted a lot of questions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked how peaceful and quiet most of the hike was. Sometimes Abby and I have gone on hikes where the hum of civilization never really goes away. Here, the main hum was of water, which was usually not too far away.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/coopers-rock-2014-05-03/up.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Abby spotted a huge toad!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/coopers-rock-2014-05-03/toad.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;lunch-break&#34;&gt;Lunch break&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were warned about poison ivy where we stopped for lunch by the river:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/coopers-rock-2014-05-03/poison-ivy.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/coopers-rock-2014-05-03/lunch-break.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;back-up&#34;&gt;Back up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always find it strangely appealing to hike along running water. Water makes me feel like I am not alone or lost, that there is something soothing and dependable out there:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/coopers-rock-2014-05-03/water.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It was fun to see ferns unfurling here and there:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/coopers-rock-2014-05-03/ferns.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We went back a different way than we came, and that involved a bunch of stream crossings over bridges. Here, some of us sat on a bridge for a photo:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/coopers-rock-2014-05-03/bridge.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;henry-clay-iron-furnace&#34;&gt;Henry Clay Iron Furnace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took a detour to the historic &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Clay_Furnace&#34;&gt;Henry Clay Iron Furnace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/coopers-rock-2014-05-03/henry-clay-iron-furnace.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/coopers-rock-2014-05-03/henry-clay-iron-furnace-back.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I crawled inside to take a look.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/coopers-rock-2014-05-03/henry-clay-iron-furnace-up.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/coopers-rock-2014-05-03/henry-clay-iron-furnace-entrance.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;lost&#34;&gt;Lost?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got &amp;ldquo;lost&amp;rdquo; on the way back to the parking lot, but not really. We missed a turn, but quickly, Terri noticed that things did not look right, and we backtracked, and turned onto the Rhododenron Trail as we should have. All good!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/coopers-rock-2014-05-03/rhododendron-trail.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/coopers-rock-2014-05-03/map.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Back to civilization:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/coopers-rock-2014-05-03/done.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;missing-the-optional-hike&#34;&gt;Missing the optional hike&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was an optional 3-mile hike planned after the main one, to reach another scenic area, but Terri and Jeff decided it was too complicated to officially reorganize a group for it, and just left it to everyone to figure out appropriate car pools to park in a lot nearer to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four of us drove to the lot a bit later than some others, and unfortunately, someone pulled into the last parking space. As it was already drizzling rain anyway, and there was no parking to be found nearby, we just waved goodbye and started heading home. Maybe this was a good thing, because the rain quickly began to pour really hard!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coopers Rock State Forest is a great place to visit. The hiking is great, with varied terrain and elevation changes, lots to see. Perhaps in the future Abby and I will check out the camping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you been to Coopers Rock? For hiking, cross-country skiing, camping, or rock climbing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hiking again in Boyce-Mayview Park three months later</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2014/04/12/hiking-again-in-boyce-mayview-park-three-months-later/</link>

      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2014/04/12/hiking-again-in-boyce-mayview-park-three-months-later/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the New Year in January, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2014/01/01/happy-new-year-with-a-boyce-mayview-park-hike-wetlands/&#34;&gt;Abby and I went on a brisk winter hike through the Pittsburgh hiking meetup group in Boyce-Mayview Park&lt;/a&gt;, which was new to us at the time. We enjoyed the experience so much that we knew that we were going to return in the spring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So on a warm and sunny afternoon (temperature rising beyond 70 degrees F), we went (by ourselves) to Boyce-Mayview Park to do some hiking. We ended up doing maybe eight miles. Obviously, things just looked different without the snow and ice, and with some vegetation and more active life forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;parking&#34;&gt;Parking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(You can download a detailed map of the park &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.twpusc.org/magazine/pdf/boyce-mayview-park_map.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We originally headed to parking at the trail head right next to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ardolinopizza.com/&#34;&gt;Ardolino&amp;rsquo;s Pizza&lt;/a&gt;, off Boyce Road, but the small parking lot was full, not unexpectedly, so we drove all the way around to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.twpusc.org/crc/crc-home&#34;&gt;Boyce-Mayview community and recreation center&lt;/a&gt; entrance from Mayview Road, to park in a lot further in near the Outdoor Classroom, use the restroom building next to it, and enter the trail systems from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-hike&#34;&gt;Our hike&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We encountered a bit of mud on the trails that we took, but nothing too unpleasant. We both wore our Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just basically wandered around, without any map or GPS, knowing that as long as we kept Chartiers Creek in sight, we could get back to where we started. Also, with all the many elevation changes, we could often see the community and recreation center up high. So we did not have to worry about getting lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I very much enjoy hiking in the vicinity of water, seeing it and hearing it, so we spent a good deal time on the trails near Chartiers Creek, just following its curves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point in the wetlands we got excited and thought we saw an island and so we went there and hiked a trail there all the way till we realized it wasn&amp;rsquo;t really an island after all. It was fun being surrounded by water on both sides on a strip of land, but also that part of the hike involved a lot of bugs happy to try to bite us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After about two hours, we eventually ended up at the Boyce Road trail head and I was really hungry and peeked into Ardolino&amp;rsquo;s, but Abby didn&amp;rsquo;t think it was a good idea for us to order pizza (we had packed our own lunch anyway), so we turned around and hiked back up, and stopped somewhere on a trail to sit and eat lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we made our way back to our start. At one point it wasn&amp;rsquo;t clear how to get to a trail connecting where we were, high up, back to the trail next to Chartiers Creek, so we just took a &amp;ldquo;shortcut&amp;rdquo; (hiking poles are very helpful for the Boyce-Mayview Park in general), scrambling down to that trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-few-photos-of-stuff-we-saw&#34;&gt;A few photos of stuff we saw&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;View from where we parked:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Outdoor Classroom and the restroom building:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/boyce-mayview-2014-04-12/outdoor-classroom.jpg&#34; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A view of Chartiers Creek:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A little garter snake crossed our path. You might be able spot it in this photo. At my request, Abby did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; pick it up to show to me.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/boyce-mayview-2014-04-12/garter-snake.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A sample trail winding around a hill:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/boyce-mayview-2014-04-12/hill-trail.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Rapids! We did see someone in a canoe further upstream.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/boyce-mayview-2014-04-12/rapids.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Flowers (sorry, I know very little about identifying flowers):&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/boyce-mayview-2014-04-12/flowers.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Crossing over to the &amp;ldquo;island&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/boyce-mayview-2014-04-12/island.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We saw woodpeckers, geese, vultures, groundhogs, and other critters during the hike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without leaves on trees obstructing the view, it is fairly easy to see where one is, as far as elevation and landmarks (we knew we had to get back down to the creek level and then back upward to where we parked):&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/boyce-mayview-2014-04-12/elevation.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was great to return to Boyce-Mayview Park in the spring. I expect that we&amp;rsquo;ll go back in a couple more weeks, as more vegetation grows and even more birds hang out. I highly recommend checking out this park, located in Upper St. Clair just half an hour drive from the city of Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Was it worth sprinting to a terrible fall to finish 25th in the CMU Pretty Good Race 5K?</title>

      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/09/06/was-it-worth-sprinting-to-a-terrible-fall-to-finish-25th-in-the-cmu-pretty-good-race-5k/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On a pleasant Friday late afternoon, not too hot or humid, I ran my 9th CMU Pretty Good Race 5K (and this was Abby&amp;rsquo;s 3rd).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, I did the Run Around The Square 5K in my &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/08/24/reflections-on-my-slowest-run-around-the-square-5k-in-13-years/&#34;&gt;slowest time in 13 years&lt;/a&gt;. I was happy to be finishing a 5K race at all. I&amp;rsquo;ve improved some in fitness in the past two weeks, but not enough to make a big difference for today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like last year, I was going into this race not optimally fit. However, given that I just ran a 5K two weeks ago, I had a good idea of what I could do in another 5K, how hard I could push myself. Like I said last year, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not about how fast I went, but how much I gave of what I had&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never expected just how much I would give this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;before-the-race&#34;&gt;Before the race&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked over from my office across Flagstaff Hill to Schenley Park.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/pretty-good-race-2013/flagstaff-hill.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Flagstaff Hill&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For some reason, Abby decided to use our dinky Razor kick scooter to come in from home for the race. Unfortunately, she showed up before the race with a bloody hand and knee, having had a nasty fall while using the scooter on the way to Schenley Park. Oops. She&amp;rsquo;s been tired a lot lately (I previously mentioned her dangerous &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/08/24/reflections-on-my-slowest-run-around-the-square-5k-in-13-years/&#34;&gt;decline in fitness all year&lt;/a&gt;) and was regretting signing up to do the Pretty Good Race with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She tried to be a good sport despite the accident coming in.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Abby before race&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here I am in orange:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;weather-conditions&#34;&gt;Weather conditions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Temperature and humidity were much, much better than last year. That promised a considerable time advantage relative to last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-plan&#34;&gt;The plan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with last year, my plan was to make the most of the final downhill part of the course, as well as go for a sprint to pass as many people as I possibly could during the final brief but terrible uphill to the finish line. I was going to have to pace myself intelligently to have something left for the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-race&#34;&gt;The race&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I paced myself, not going too fast in the first half of the race. I almost entirely ran my own slow race, as there was nobody else really near my steady pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After turning around, I starting going hard downhill. I was worried that I didn&amp;rsquo;t see Abby at all during the race. At some point, I passed her walking back to the start. She must have dropped out very early on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pushing really hard in the final part of the race. Near the uphill finish, I saw a guy slowing down, and he raised his arms as though celebrating finishing. This gesture instantly caused me to go into a sprint more furious than any other sprint finish in my entire life. I made up a huge distance and reached the finish chute just a step before he did. And as I did so, the dry gravel and my leaning too far forward caused me to slip and fall, really, really badly. But I had finished ahead of the guy. Mission accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;injuries&#34;&gt;Injuries&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lay stunned and in terrible pain for a few seconds. I had to check whether I was seriously broken. It felt like I was not. I was rather injured, but miraculously, no broken bones. I had managed to break my fall not with my teeth or eyes or fingers, but with my left thigh, right knee, left forearm, left palm, and right palm. I was quite badly scraped and bruised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard people asking me, &amp;ldquo;Was it worth it?&amp;rdquo; I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to answer that. I moved on, stumbling in pain as I tried to catch my breath. I had done what I do, give the race my all, and then some. I was gouged and bleeding, and my right knee had swollen up hugely almost instantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wasn&amp;rsquo;t the worst falling injury I&amp;rsquo;ve had in my life, but it&amp;rsquo;s probably my worst since a fall off a bike (also spinning off loose gravel) twenty years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/pretty-good-race-2013/left-palm.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Left palm&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/pretty-good-race-2013/left-thigh.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Left thigh&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/pretty-good-race-2013/right-knee.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Right knee&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/pretty-good-race-2013/left-arm.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Left arm&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby returned, and had to explain to the volunteers that she wasn&amp;rsquo;t just finishing, but had dropped out earlier. While I was trying to clean myself up some, she said that she had fallen early on during the race and decided that that was enough and she wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to finish the race. So this is her first Did Not Finish (DNF) in a race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;feeling-lucky&#34;&gt;Feeling lucky&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main thing I kept on feeling while we walked back to my office and then back to my car (very slowly; everything around my right knee was just messed up) and went home for both of us to clean up from our injuries: &lt;em&gt;luck&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could have been much worse for both of us. My most severe damage was not even to my right knee area (even though walking was difficult) but really my left hand, whose heel of palm was basically scraped away and bruised and my wrist was messed up. But no broken fingers or teeth or wrists or ankles. Same with Abby: lucky us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;was-it-worth-it&#34;&gt;Was it worth it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished officially tied for 25th place with the guy I actually beat, both of us registering as finishing in 25:28 in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kalp/PGR/2013.html&#34;&gt;official race results&lt;/a&gt;. Well, I ran 37 seconds faster than last year. That&amp;rsquo;s not nothing, although two years ago I ran 24:36.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I knew the time was not going to be great: I just ran 25:36 in Run Around The Square two weeks ago. The real point was that like last year, I gave it my all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But was it worth getting injured for sprinting for no glory whatsoever? It&amp;rsquo;s not like I was running for first place or something &amp;ldquo;important&amp;rdquo;. Or is that the wrong way to think about it? Why is it worth trying your best for first place but not for 25th place instead of 26th place? Let&amp;rsquo;s ignore the (unfortunate?) fact that in some circles, first place is associated with large monetary rewards, when pondering that question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A different question would be, &amp;ldquo;If you knew you would get this injured from this sprint, would you have done it anyway?&amp;rdquo; I guess the question is &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo;. But how could I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt;? There is always risk. There is risk crossing the street, or driving on the turnpike. I&amp;rsquo;ve never fallen during a sprint before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another different question: &amp;ldquo;How will this accident change how you run in the future?&amp;rdquo; I suppose my answer is, I&amp;rsquo;ll be more careful to keep my balance. But am I going to stop the sprinting at the end of a race? I don&amp;rsquo;t see how I can. &lt;em&gt;It is in those moments when I can barely breathe and the world is becoming a blur that I am living with most intensity and purity.&lt;/em&gt; These moments don&amp;rsquo;t come often, but when they are available for the taking, why would I not accept these gifts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will keep sprinting. I will keep trying to beat whoever is beatable in front of me. That&amp;rsquo;s part of the whole point of racing. I admit to feeling a little odd to being so serious about it when others do it much more casually (and it&amp;rsquo;s their right to do so and they&amp;rsquo;re probably smarter and more balanced than me, I concede). But I don&amp;rsquo;t race often, so when I do, I try to make it matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my response is: I will need to work on maintaining balance and running on tricky surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, Abby and I decided we should make sure to have a first aid kit around in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-next-race&#34;&gt;The next race&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My eleventh Great Race 10K is coming up. I want to do considerably better than I did last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I have a lot of healing to do. I am more of a wreck right now than the post-race photos indicate. Things are all swollen and messed up and probably will be for an entire week or two. It&amp;rsquo;s just amazing I haven&amp;rsquo;t broken bones or ligaments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby and I simultaneously had unfortunate falling accidents today. I was proud to have run as hard as I could given my fitness and will. I don&amp;rsquo;t regret sprinting for 25th place, even if it cost me this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, we both need to heal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reflections on my slowest Run Around the Square 5K in 13 years</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/08/24/reflections-on-my-slowest-run-around-the-square-5k-in-13-years/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 24 Aug 2013 12:45:47 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/08/24/reflections-on-my-slowest-run-around-the-square-5k-in-13-years/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year was the ninth time I ran in the annual &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.runaroundthesquare.com/&#34;&gt;Run Around The Square 5K race&lt;/a&gt;, and Abby&amp;rsquo;s third year in a row. The conditions were great: cool and dry, in contrast to the usual hot and humid conditions at this time of year. (Last year I reported on &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/08/25/my-eighth-time-doing-run-around-the-square-5k/&#34;&gt;my eighth running of the race&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Abby and I ran this race rather slowly, but were happy and enjoyed the day. Here&amp;rsquo;s why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;both-of-us-coming-back-from-setbacks&#34;&gt;Both of us coming back from setbacks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to note is that both Abby and I have been recovering from setbacks this year, as I reported two weeks ago after I ran the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/08/09/getting-up-when-reality-punches-you-in-the-face-running-the-second-liberty-mile-in-pittsburgh/&#34;&gt;second GNC Live Well Liberty Mile&lt;/a&gt; 18 seconds slower than last year. That race had me vowing to get back on track, and the very next day I did &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/08/10/emerging-from-my-three-months-of-illness-self-pitying-and-self-loathing/&#34;&gt;begin getting back on track&lt;/a&gt;. The road back to a regular exercise routine has not been easy in the past two weeks, but I have very gradually ramping up on running as well as minimal strength training every single day since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, I ran the Run Around The Square 5K in 24:35.6 and was pretty to have recovered from several years of decline in fitness and self-care, by running my best time since 2006. For this year, I wrote, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what goal to set for next year. I suppose I could set a goal of getting yet faster, breaking 24:15. That sounds reasonable to me. Going back down to 24:00 may even be possible. It&amp;rsquo;s too early right now to tell. But one thing is for sure: I have no intention of slowing down from this year to next.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I did not set a firm enough goal. I have learned the hard way that if you don&amp;rsquo;t make a commitment (and then follow up with the discipline and sacrifices required to achieve it), then even in the absence of accidents, a maybe-goal is worthless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, I went into the 5K race so untrained (two weeks of slowly ramping up before the race is not enough for any training benefits to kick in) that I basically knew that I was going to be super slow. I figured that since I lost 18 seconds in the mile, I would be happy if I lost only one minute in a 3K. So that was my expectation: finish around 25:36 this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;before-the-race&#34;&gt;Before the race&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided that this was the race in which I debut my new orange running singlet, to replace my over-decade use of a blue singlet that Abby has gotten very annoyed with:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/run-around-the-square-2013/franklin-orange.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin wearing orange singlet&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Also, note that since I bought a SPIbelt earlier this year, I now always run races wearing a SPIbelt to carry my phone. This is particularly convenient when running a race where you have to park far from the start line and want access to your phone after a race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wore my Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek shoes again. Since last year&amp;rsquo;s fiasco in which I &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/09/30/running-my-10th-great-race-10k-obscene-but-in-a-good-way/&#34;&gt;injured my left foot from having the straps on my left foot too tight&lt;/a&gt;, I never again put the straps on too tight!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hanging out before the race start in Regent Square:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/run-around-the-square-2013/before.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Before start&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/run-around-the-square-2013/franklin-ready.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin ready&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Start line just a few minutes before race start:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/run-around-the-square-2013/start-line.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Start line&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-race&#34;&gt;The race&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;http://runhigh.com/2013RESULTS/R082413AA.html&#34;&gt;Race results.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;different-race-logistics&#34;&gt;Different race logistics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One very important change to the race, and one I greatly appreciated, was the staggered start. Faster runners were told to line up front and start up first. This is very helpful to control the congestion and confusion that happens in a large race when too many slower people start up front and have to be passed (including unfortunately young children that Abby and I have seen trampled on every year!). In particular, it is really tricky to be passing lots of people once in the trails of Frick Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;first-mile&#34;&gt;First mile&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the ridiculous problems I created for myself by going too fast two weeks ago in the Liberty Mile, I vowed to go out at a reasonable pace in this 5K. I found this easy to do because of the staggered start, which meant that there were fewer people to have to accelerate past throwing off one&amp;rsquo;s own internal speedometer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usual lot of young and old musicians were playing music along the course. What a great neighborhood tradition!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still get confused seeing the champagne stop near the end of the first mile at the entrance into the trails of Frick Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did the first mile in a leisurely 8:15 (compared to 7:18 last year).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;second-mile&#34;&gt;Second mile&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did the second mile in 10:17 (compared to 10:11 last year). I did not feel too bad. I was running a bit conservatively, because my training runs had been so slow and short and tough for me in the past two weeks. I wanted to be in position to run really well the final downhill in the third mile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;third-mile&#34;&gt;Third mile&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I let loose in the third mile. Because I had avoided going pukey in the second mile, I covered it in 7:06, actually a second faster than the 7:07 of last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the staggered start, there was not bad congestion during the third mile, and I found it safe to pass people at will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;final-sprint&#34;&gt;Final sprint&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a gut-wrenching final sprint. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t even looking at the clock or my watch. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t one of those races in which I put it all out there on the course. Instead, this was a race where I was grateful to be running at all, and had no expectations other than to finish strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I finished in 25:38, just a bit longer than a minute over last year&amp;rsquo;s 24:35.6. My &lt;em&gt;slowest&lt;/em&gt; Run Around The Square 5K time &lt;em&gt;in 13 years&lt;/em&gt;. But it was a clean finish, and I was so excited to simply be back and running faster than 26 minutes, at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;after-the-race&#34;&gt;After the race&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I was not pukey, I was certainly breathing hard when I finished.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/run-around-the-square-2013/franklin-after.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin after the race&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I went off to drink water and start eating some food.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/run-around-the-square-2013/view.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;View&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;improvement&#34;&gt;Improvement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I went back to the finish line to wait for Abby to finish. I saw Todd and his wife Gabrielle hanging around. Gabrielle said she took my &amp;ldquo;advice&amp;rdquo; (from last year) to go all out to the point of feeling pukey. I admitted that this time around, I didn&amp;rsquo;t follow my own advice. Gabrielle finished over 5 minutes faster this year than last year!! Todd finished over 8 minutes faster!! It&amp;rsquo;s great to see people in their late 40s improve their fitness so much in a single year. I saw the couple running together a couple of times in Frick Park this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;decline&#34;&gt;Decline&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby finished. She was out of breath and pukey, but I was proud of her for finishing. Because of the tremendous decline in health and fitness she has experienced this year, I was not sure she would actually finish the race.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/run-around-the-square-2013/abby-finish.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Abby finishing&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-food-and-refreshments&#34;&gt;More food and refreshments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We lined up to sample more food and recovered. It was a beautiful day to be outside.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/run-around-the-square-2013/abby-recovered.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/run-around-the-square-2013/franklin-recovered.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The hot dogs and beer line was particularly long, but we finally reached the tables.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/run-around-the-square-2013/hot-dogs-beer.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Hot dogs and beer&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;walking-out-of-frick-park-back-to-the-car&#34;&gt;Walking out of Frick Park back to the car&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help taking a photo of the sign for beer and champagne that was still up on the trail entrance as we passed by:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/run-around-the-square-2013/beer-champagne.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Dunning&amp;#39;s beer and champagne stop&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;concern-about-abby&#34;&gt;Concern about Abby&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I was happy that Abby managed to finish the 5K race, I was very concerned about her overall health and fitness, which have continued to be poor this year since she broke her foot in February. Here are her Run Around The Square 5K times since she started doing it with me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2011: 37:15&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2012: 36:04&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2013: 39:54&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was almost 4 minutes slower than last year. She&amp;rsquo;s lost &lt;em&gt;several years of fitness&lt;/em&gt; this year, and came in 105th of 116 in her age group. Again, we are grateful she is walking and running at all, but this has been a very bad year for her, and this impacts not only her own life, but ours more generally. We need to work on getting her back on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;goal-for-next-year&#34;&gt;Goal for next year?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, my real goal is to simply continue my exercise program and not break it again, and that includes the winter slump I usually enter. Last year, I had a slump in the final months of the year, and then woke up and &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/12/28/meditations-on-climbing-the-36-floors-of-the-pitt-cathedral-of-learning/&#34;&gt;started exercising again around New Year&lt;/a&gt;, and even signed up for the Pittsburgh Marathon as a way to force myself to stay active in the winter. I believe that if I simply avoid self-caused setbacks, I should be able to return myself to a decent level of fitness. I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; going to sign up for the Pittsburgh Marathon again. Almost certainly, however, I will sign up for the Pittsburgh Half Marathon! Last winter, I rather enjoyed &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/03/30/report-on-just-a-short-run-my-first-half-marathon-in-nine-years/&#34;&gt;training for and running the Just A Short Run half marathon&lt;/a&gt;. I reached good fitness through that, but squandered my fitness through overtraining and injury leading up to the marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;races-this-year&#34;&gt;Races this year&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the shorter term, I have two races to run in the coming month: the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/09/07/running-my-8th-pretty-good-race-5k-dealing-with-disappointment/&#34;&gt;CMU Pretty Good Race 5K&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/09/30/running-my-10th-great-race-10k-obscene-but-in-a-good-way/&#34;&gt;Great Race 10K&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, I did very poorly in the Pretty Good Race 5K because I was injured and exhausted, running 26:05. This year, I expect to do better than that. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to do the 24:36 of 2011, but given that I easily beat 26 minutes today, I will beat 26 minutes two weeks from now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Great Race 10K last year, I was still in a state of exhaustion and undertraining, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t even pay any attention to time goals, and finished slowly in 48:23. I see no reason why, if I continue improving my fitness in the next month (in contrast to last year&amp;rsquo;s dreadful September), I should not be able to run under 48:00.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;update-of-2013-09-06&#34;&gt;(Update of 2013-09-06)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/09/06/was-it-worth-sprinting-to-a-terrible-fall-to-finish-25th-in-the-cmu-pretty-good-race-5k/&#34;&gt;my report on running the Pretty Good Race 5K this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run Around The Square continued to thrive and improve, and I&amp;rsquo;m grateful for both the registration cap (to maintain the quality of the event) as well as the staggered start. And all the sponsors feeding us afterwards!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby and I were happy to have finished the race, even if we are both less fit now than we have been in years. But I think this is a wake up call for us to get back in shape. For example, I miss the long hikes we used to do last year when we had the stamina to actually do and enjoy them. The example Todd and Gabrielle set as they massively improved their fitness in the past year is inspiring. Abby and I should be able to do this too, if we make it a priority.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Getting up when reality punches you in the face: running the second Liberty Mile in Pittsburgh</title>

      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/08/09/getting-up-when-reality-punches-you-in-the-face-running-the-second-liberty-mile-in-pittsburgh/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/08/17/the-inaugural-liberty-mile-a-review-of-pittsburghs-first-road-mile-race/&#34;&gt;I reported on the excitement I had running in and watching&lt;/a&gt; the first &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.libertymile.org/&#34;&gt;GNC Live Well Liberty Mile&lt;/a&gt;. I was so excited about running it again that late this May, having mostly recovered from my &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/05/06/2013-pittsburgh-marathon-my-135th-race-was-my-worst-i-finished/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Marathon disaster&lt;/a&gt;, I quickly pre-registered for the Liberty Mile for this year. I anticipated training to run well in this year&amp;rsquo;s Liberty Mile, given that I was not really trained last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this year I have been in very poor shape since the marathon, because of a whole series of health problems and disruptions in my life resulting from a skin rash I got during a &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/05/12/my-rachel-carson-trail-hike-for-the-year/&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Trail hike in May&lt;/a&gt;. The upshot is that I have been running (and exercising in general) very little in the past three months. As the Liberty Mile approached, I wished that I had not registered for it at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I faced a dilemma: what should I do about the race?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;deciding-to-run-it&#34;&gt;Deciding to run it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good thing about the mile is that it&amp;rsquo;s short enough that of course I can finish the thing. So I felt there was no excuse to just bail out and forfeit my pre-registration. I was going to run it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bad thing about the mile is that it is brutal to actually run &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;. I have always felt pukey after running a mile as &amp;ldquo;fast&amp;rdquo; as I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, I decided to still try to run the Liberty Mile as fast as I could, knowing that I would probably suffer for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to go out periodically for short, slow runs, something like two miles at a time, to gain at least have &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; kind of conditioning. Also, earlier this week I put in some &amp;ldquo;fast&amp;rdquo; repeats of about 300m out in Frick Park: the only &amp;ldquo;fast&amp;rdquo; running I&amp;rsquo;ve done since April!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this whole week I was feeling bad, stress exacerbated by home repair disruptions with the contractors coming over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;support-from-abby&#34;&gt;Support from Abby&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, I went to the race alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, Abby offered to go downtown with me so she could watch the race and be with me. (In May when I was pre-registering for the race, she had just spent months barely mobile because of a broken foot and was simply not certain she would be able to even run a mile again by August.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really appreciated this because I felt rather vulnerable about this race. We planned to watch the first wave start, and then have me run my heat (again the &amp;ldquo;Unstoppable 40+&amp;rdquo; heat), then hang out afterwards and watch the elite heats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We drove downtown and parked and walked to the packet pickup area in Market Square. I was pleased that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t raining; it had rained earlier in the day, but that was all over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we arrived later than other people, they had run out of Small T-shirts and so I got a Medium.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/liberty-mile-2013/abby.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Abby holding my T-shirt&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;changes-in-the-course&#34;&gt;Changes in the course&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should note that the course was changed from last year. The change makes sense because it considerably simplifies the logistics. Last year, the course was a straight shot down Liberty Ave toward downtown. This year, the course was an almost-loop course, first going out on Penn Ave, then turning to head back in on Liberty Ave. The advantage is that the start and finish are close together, so it is much easier for people to plan to spectate or get back to their cars or whatever. I do like the concept of the straight downhill road course, but understand the logistical difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan was to do my best to avoid going out too fast, and try to push hard in the final downhill portion of the race. Easier said than done, because last year I certainly wanted to avoid going out too fast, but did anyway!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;before-the-race&#34;&gt;Before the race&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wore my Vibram FiveFingers Bikila LS shoes again.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/liberty-mile-2013/before-start.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin before race&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At the GNC booth, I saw they were giving out free samples of energy bars and other stuff. I was feeling hungry, and although I know that it is best not to race having just eaten, especially unfamiliar foods, I took a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gnc.com/product/index.jsp?productId=4468895&#34;&gt;GNC Pro Performance Pro Crunch Lite&lt;/a&gt; energy bar, and ate a couple of bites before giving the remainder to Abby to put away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was probably a big mistake to have eaten from the energy bar, because it didn&amp;rsquo;t really agree with me. Oops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;start-and-finish-lines&#34;&gt;Start and finish lines&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We checked out the start and finish lines.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/liberty-mile-2013/start-line.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Start line&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/liberty-mile-2013/finish-line.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Finish line&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-heat-at-7-00-pm&#34;&gt;First heat (at 7:00 PM)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We watched as the first &amp;ldquo;fun run&amp;rdquo; heat went.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/liberty-mile-2013/first-heat-start.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-race-heat-at-7-20-pm&#34;&gt;My race (heat at 7:20 PM)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to the start line and lined up &lt;em&gt;at the back&lt;/em&gt;, where I knew I belonged. I was not sure that I would not be last place in my heat!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/liberty-mile-2013/my-heat-start.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here I am, looking as tired as I in fact was, still taking medication for my skin problem that is not completely gone (usually showing up as spots on my neck or hands and arms):&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/liberty-mile-2013/franklin-before.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin before the race&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As the race began, I tried not to go too fast, but did. 1:34 for the first quarter mile, not good at all! Last year, I ran the mile in 6:39, and went out in 1:29 for the first quarter. This year, I was hoping to go under 7:00 at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I slowed down for the second quarter, then finally found a steady pace for the third quarter. During the final quarter, I saw the finish line and eventually saw the clock ticking up toward 7:00. I was &lt;em&gt;furious&lt;/em&gt; that I might not be able to finish a 7-minute mile. I sprinted all out and didn&amp;rsquo;t actually finish under 7:00 according to the clock (the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.areep.com/events/libertymile/&#34;&gt;official race results&lt;/a&gt; say I finished in 7:02), but my chip time was 6:56, so I actually did run the mile in under 7 minutes!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My splits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1:34 (went too fast)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1:56 (uphill, deliberately slowed down)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1:46 (steady)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1:40 (final kick)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-photos-of-the-liberty-mile&#34;&gt;More photos of the Liberty Mile&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More photos of the entire event can be seen &lt;a href=&#34;http://petemadia.photoshelter.com/gallery/2013-GNC-Live-Well-Liberty-Mile/G0000gQc.MfyoOAE/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;after-my-race&#34;&gt;After my race&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, I felt really, really crappy:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/liberty-mile-2013/done-in-pain.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin done for a while but still in pain&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In fact, for a full half hour after the race, all I could do was walk and sit around with Abby trying to feel less crappy. &lt;strong&gt;I have never felt so bad for so long after any race of any distance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reflections&#34;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mentally, also, I was still very &lt;em&gt;angry&lt;/em&gt; at myself: I came in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.areep.com/events/libertymile/results/13lm_uno.txt&#34;&gt;60th place out of 74&lt;/a&gt;, running a chip time of 6:56, a whopping &lt;em&gt;18 seconds&lt;/em&gt; slower than last year. That&amp;rsquo;s a huge decrease in fitness for a mile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan for this year, 2013, was supposed to be to get back into great health and fitness, &amp;ldquo;the shape I was in five years ago&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s why, for the new year, I got into &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/12/28/meditations-on-climbing-the-36-floors-of-the-pitt-cathedral-of-learning/&#34;&gt;climbing the Cathedral of Learning&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s why I got into running in the winter](/blog/2012/12/31/why-i-went-frick-park-trail-running-in-snowfall-for-the-first-time-in-a-decade/). It&amp;rsquo;s why I &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/01/30/why-and-how-i-am-going-to-run-the-2013-pittsburgh-marathon/&#34;&gt;decided to run the Pittsburgh Marathon&lt;/a&gt;. I blew it my overtraining for the marathon and then suffering freak skin problems after a hike that ended up seeing doctors something like five times, and being put on medication that messed with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a lot to be angry about. But after I recovered, I became calm and stopped being angry about being punched in the face by reality. I decided that it was motivation for me to turn my life around. I decided that I was going to get back into a regular exercise routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In just the past three months, I have lost all of my fitness of the past several years. But I have a plan to get back on track, starting &lt;em&gt;tomorrow&lt;/em&gt;. I believe that for 2014, I can still get back into my 2008 shape. It&amp;rsquo;s a matter of making it a priority, over all the other things I have been doing in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;going-home&#34;&gt;Going home&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I recovered enough that I felt like eating and walking again, Abby and I went back to our car and we went home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only minutes after getting home did I realize that I had &lt;em&gt;totally forgotten&lt;/em&gt; to stick around to watch the elite runners&amp;rsquo; races!! That was far from my mind when I was feeling nauseous and reflecting on my poor fitness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The race was very well organized, and I&amp;rsquo;m thankful for the continuation of this new Pittsburgh tradition. Although I had a humbling experience in my heat, I totally want to be back for a third try at executing a good mile next year! And I am thankful that I actually ran it, because it gave me the resolve to regain my lost fitness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My Rachel Carson Trail hike for the year (13.4 miles): and how this is about love and gratitude</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/05/12/my-rachel-carson-trail-hike-for-the-year/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 May 2013 22:24:40 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/05/12/my-rachel-carson-trail-hike-for-the-year/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I did my first hike of the year (normally I would have done hiking already in the spring, but the combination of Abby&amp;rsquo;s broken foot and my Pittsburgh Marathon training this year resulted in no space for hiking until after the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/05/06/2013-pittsburgh-marathon-my-135th-race-was-my-worst-i-finished/&#34;&gt;marathon, which I did seven days ago&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first hike of the year just happened to turn out to be a grueling Rachel Carson Trail hike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, I reported on the two Rachel Carson Trail Challenge goal training hikes I did in &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/04/29/a-pretty-rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-hike/&#34;&gt;late April&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/06/03/a-totally-exhausting-rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-hike/&#34;&gt;early June&lt;/a&gt;. This year, I did the fourth of eight of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge/rctc13/goaltraining&#34;&gt;year&amp;rsquo;s goal training hikes&lt;/a&gt; offered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sunday, May 12&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leader: Donna Stolz 412-303-6102, Eileen Lessman 412-760-8863&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;13.4 miles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elevation change: 5055 ft&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This hike begins in North Park and heads over to Emmerling Park, then up and over Rich Hill and Lefever Hill. We end at the Log Cabin Road checkpoint location. Meet at Log Cabin Road parking area. Take Route 28 to Exit #12. Turn right at the end of the ramp, then right at the stop sign onto Little Deer Creek Road (aka Russellton Road). Travel about 1.5 miles and turn right on Log Cabin Road. Park about 100 yards ahead on the right.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of this year, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to do &lt;em&gt;only one&lt;/em&gt; Rachel Carson Trail hike a year, so this was it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my report on the hike, as well as my long-awaited explanation of why this trail means so much to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;weather&#34;&gt;Weather&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conditions were good. It was kind of chilly and windy, probably 45-50 degrees throughout the hike. The sun came and went. There were only short periods of light drizzling rain, thankfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;footwear&#34;&gt;Footwear&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek shoes I wore last year on the Rachel Carson Trail developed holes, as a result of which I &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/08/28/five-reasons-we-just-stocked-up-on-vibram-fivefingers-kso-trek-shoes/&#34;&gt;stocked up on some new ones&lt;/a&gt;. The pair that I opened, I&amp;rsquo;ve worn only a couple of times, and I wore this pair today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;comparison-with-last-year-s-hike&#34;&gt;Comparison with last year&amp;rsquo;s hike&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/06/03/a-totally-exhausting-rachel-carson-trail-challenge-goal-training-hike/&#34;&gt;Last year on the 18.1 mile hike&lt;/a&gt;, I was stupid about my smartphone, and this year I was smarter. Today&amp;rsquo;s hike was a shorter 13.4, so I was sure the battery would last long enough, if I didn&amp;rsquo;t take photos with flash. And of course, I always have a phone charge in my car now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year&amp;rsquo;s hike went east to west and ended in North Park. This year&amp;rsquo;s hike went west to east and started in North Park. But being shorter, it did not end in Springdale. It is really a different hike when you go on the same trail but in a different direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might enjoy comparing the photos in different directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;meeting-up-at-log-cabin-road&#34;&gt;Meeting up at Log Cabin Road&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John and I arrived on time but not early, which meant that when we arrived, we saw a whole contingent of people already carpooling to head to North Park. We never saw those people again. Oops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, although we were ready to go with the hike leader, Donna, latecomers kept on showing up, and we were lenient and waited for them, before all the rest of us remaining headed to North Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waiting for latecomers:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.03.20.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Because of Route 910 closures, some detours were necessary as Donna&amp;rsquo;s husband drove us to North Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hike&#34;&gt;Hike&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In North Park about to begin:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.45.23.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.45.26.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;By the time we started, there were only a handful of us together as a group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was momentarily confused because I saw someone running in the &lt;em&gt;wrong direction&lt;/em&gt; on the trail and thought she might be one of us, and was worried. I tried to follow her to call out to her, but she disappeared quickly:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.45.34.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Donna called out to me, and I rejoined the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In North Park, a few sections of the trail are on the road, but then we go into the woods for real:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.51.43.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.51.49.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_08.52.15.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a whole bunch of stream crossings while in North Park. Some of them are easier than others. I should note that one of the harder ones had some fast water and basically ensured that your feet would get wet, because the logs were floating and not completely safe to step on. Some people jumped, but that&amp;rsquo;s not safe. Wearing KSO Trek shoes, since the temperature was around 50, I was fine just getting my feet wet by walking through the water.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.05.16.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.05.22.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.10.50.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.10.56.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Out of the woods onto the railroad tracks (note that hiking in the reverse direction is tricky because it&amp;rsquo;s not well-marked where to get off the railroad tracks into the woods; John and I got lost the last time we did the reverse hike and had to backtrack!).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.18.50.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.19.23.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a good amount of road walking on this section of the Rachel Carson Trail.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.27.01.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.27.14.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.29.46.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_09.53.40.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Crossing Route 8:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.03.01.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally, the power lines:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.04.28.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.05.59.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.22.47.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I am a bit sentimental about this section of trail in Hampton Park because Abby and I have done some cross country skiing here in winter, when she used to live up here before we got married and she moved to Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.29.52.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Abby and I have also hung out here in the past watching birds.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.32.38.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.37.55.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.41.13.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.48.38.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.49.37.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.54.37.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here is where John and I got lost. I was distracted by this sight and made a turn toward it (the trail turned in the opposite direction) to check it out:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.55.25.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;OK, &amp;ldquo;acidic condensate collection tank&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.56.02.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Hmm, this didn&amp;rsquo;t look familiar.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_10.57.12.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_11.05.31.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;John and I turned back. We lost about ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_11.06.42.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_11.07.38.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_11.15.12.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_11.18.16.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;No animals out and about today!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_11.41.38.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_11.43.09.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Funny how this happens to me once or twice each hike:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.01.43.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What the heck is this going on?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.07.33.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Uphill.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.07.53.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.11.35.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.19.47.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally at Emmerling Park, about 3 hours and 45 minutes into the hike.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.28.15.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I hung out at Emmerling Park for about ten or fifteen minutes, using the restroom and then playing on the swing relieving my aching feet while waiting for John and the others to catch up and also use the restroom. The truth is, I was ready to stop hiking already, feeling tired. I was also sore because of two falls I had sustained earlier in the hike. One of the falls involved my tripping on my right foot, causing me to land hard on my left, reinjuring my left knee that I had hurt before the marathon in a fall down the stairs. My left knee was causing me serious pain again now in the hike. I also fell on a steep downhill earlier, landing directly on my butt and on the palm of my left hand, which reinjured my left elbow. Finally, my right Achilles was killing me, because I had not adjusted the strap of my shoe properly; I had readjusted it during the hike, but the damage was already done. I was quite ready to stop hiking, but there were still two hours to go! Oops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Red flower:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.49.45.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_12.49.54.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And now we got to sections of the trail that are abused by ATVs and rutted and muddy. (We ended up encountering someone on an ATV, in fact.)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_13.02.18.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Standing water:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_13.05.17.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_13.14.42.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_13.22.04.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_13.24.59.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No fun at all hiking through these muddy ruts:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_13.28.24.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally back into open space:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_13.29.43.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Looking back down the big hill:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_13.33.09.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s John and the rest down at the bottom:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_13.34.50.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We keep on going up:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_13.34.55.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_13.38.45.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally at the top, looking back:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_13.39.36.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_13.49.12.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_13.51.14.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s going on here?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_14.05.03.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_14.05.28.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_14.09.45.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_14.15.19.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_14.20.47.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_14.21.07.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally back to the parking lot!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/rachel-carson-trail-2013-05-12/2013-05-12_14.25.11.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;after&#34;&gt;After&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hiked something like 5 hours and 45 minutes. It felt really long to us, as our first hike of the year. My feet were killing me. I was happy to take my shoes off and drive us back home barefoot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, my phone still barely had battery power left when we finished. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure it would have lasted another hour. This is useful to know. Of course, I immediately plugged it into my car charger! I should get an extra battery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-hike-this-trail-at-all&#34;&gt;Why hike this trail at all?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby is confused why I like occasionally (once or twice a year) hiking on the Rachel Carson Trail, even though much of the time I find it tiring and weird. I&amp;rsquo;ve never fully explained this in words, so here, finally, is my explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have many sentimental reasons to hike this trail. One is that eight years ago, in late May of 2005, when a local running friend said he was doing the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge/rctc05&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Trail Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, I had taken an entire half year off from running was feeling sad and lonely. I looked up the Challenge online, and happened to find that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/rct/challenge/rctc05/training&#34;&gt;training hikes led by Barb Peterson&lt;/a&gt; were being offered in just a few days, and although I had no intention whatsoever to do the Challenge, I thought the training hikes would be a fun way to do and see something different. After doing the third of four, I was so excited by the novelty that I ended up signing up for the Challenge!! With only three weeks left, there was not much training I could do for it, but I figured that if I just took it slowly, I should be able to finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2005 Challenge was an ordeal for me to finish, but I did, and the side effect was that I fell in love with hiking in general. I met people through doing the Challenge, and in 2006 I roped John into joining me on some longer training hikes, where we met more people, and some of them I began hiking with outside the context of the Challenge, in places like the Laurel Highlands. This was before the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/pittsburghhikers/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Hiking Meetup&lt;/a&gt; was formed in May 2007 and made it much easier to find people to hike with. So the 2005 Challenge had the side effect of getting me into making hiking a regular part of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, as I was training for the 2007 Challenge, that was the time when I had just met Abby and was dancing with her, but we were not dating yet. When we were chatting at a salsa dance, I learned that she liked to hike and was intrigued. I invited her to join me and John for an April 29 Rachel Carson Trail Challenge training hike that happened to be passing through Hampton (as today&amp;rsquo;s hike did), and she said she would join us for part of it. A comic series of events then took place, in which John and I arrived at Hampton earlier than she had expected, so she had not yet made it to Hampton to meet up with us. When I paused to call her, and she said she would meet us in the trail, John and I got confused and lost because of miscommunication. I kept having to call her again and again until we finally found her, and she set us straight back onto the trail and hiked with us for a bit before turning back. That was my first interaction with Abby outside of dancing; I got to see how she gracefully handled my clumsy mistakes during this outing and how helpful she was. It was a month after that when we finally started dating. Eventually, I proposed right after a hike led by one of the guys I originally first met through a Rachel Carson Trail Challenge training hike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I associate the Rachel Carson Trail not only with falling in love with hiking, and with meeting lots of interesting people I still hike with all these years later, but also I am reminded of how I fell in love with Abby and how hiking is a big part of what we have done and do. It is slightly ironic, of course, that she does not enjoy doing most sections of the Rachel Carson Trail, so in recent years I have been hiking it either alone or with John. And that is why I try to limit how often I hike on the trail; I&amp;rsquo;ve decided now to do it only once a year, so that I spend less time on hiking that Abby doesn&amp;rsquo;t do with me, in order to share more hiking with her. But I would like to spend good time on the trail once a year from now on to remember what it means to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, despite the strange hybrid nature of the trail, I believe in its existence and maintenance. It is a reminder that even in urban/suburban environments, there is still an underlying primitive nature that we can enjoy. The volunteers of the Rachel Carson Trails Conservancy work hard to keep this unusual resource open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/03/11/fascinating-bushwhacking-hike-at-pa-state-game-land-51-dunbar/&#34;&gt;Example from March 2012 of the kind of hike that Abby and I have enjoyed doing.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rachel Carson Trail will always have a special place in my heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Donna for keeping us company for most of the hike as trail sweep, and her husband for driving us to the start!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow is my birthday, and I will be running the Pittsburgh Marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea how it will turn out, because I spent the past week not knowing whether I would even make it to the start line!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s been happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;last-saturday-recovering-from-injury&#34;&gt;Last Saturday: recovering from injury&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week ago I was in despair as &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/04/27/missing-the-final-steel-city-road-runners-taper-run-because-of-injury/&#34;&gt;I skipped a planned Steel City Road Runners final taper run because of injury and burnout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sunday&#34;&gt;Sunday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continued to rest and apply cream to my foot skin cracks. My right shin is OK again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;monday&#34;&gt;Monday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After three days off from running, I was worried about losing fitness. My feet were healing slowly. I did just a mile on the treadmill, wearing Vibram FiveFingers Bikila LS, not Luna Sandals, in order to keep my feet from drying out. I felt very sluggish and weak. I wanted to verify that I could at least run at all though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tuesday&#34;&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My right foot was hurting again, healing not complete. Also, I was feeling simply physically exhausted, like I was getting sick or something: I had a headache waking up. I took a day off work to do a lot of napping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;wednesday&#34;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought my friends who have been following my marathon training progress for the past two months should know what was up, so &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/franklin.chen/posts/10201292146683473&#34;&gt;I posted on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;If the marathon were tomorrow, I would not go to the start line. I hope another three days of healing will get me there.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later I did feel better and get in a short 1-mile run, in Luna Sandals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started carb-loading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;thursday&#34;&gt;Thursday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt better, my feet were mostly healed, and I got in a 2-mile run. I publicly declared &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/franklin.chen/posts/10201298432760621&#34;&gt;on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m on for the marathon on Sunday!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the day, in a freak accident, unfortunately, I fell down the stairs at work. Basically, I missed one step when taking a step with my left foot. I ended up landing really hard and awkwardly on my left foot on the second step down instead of the first step down, with considerable pressure on my left knee, which buckled to the side a bit, and then I landed on my right foot, with less pressure on my right knee, then I fell to the right and banged up my right ankle also. I was surprised that I didn&amp;rsquo;t actually break anything, but I was shaken. I tried to joke about this &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/franklin.chen/posts/10201299844715919&#34;&gt;on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, but the incident did not help me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;friday&#34;&gt;Friday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tired. No running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;saturday-today&#34;&gt;Saturday (today)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woke up exhausted, spent the whole day napping. Finished carb-loading. I gained about three pounds in the past three days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve done what I could in order to make it to the start line of the Pittsburgh Marathon tomorrow. Everything is out of whack, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to cancel doing it, or switch to doing the half marathon. I haven&amp;rsquo;t had a real run in &lt;em&gt;nine days&lt;/em&gt;. I regret completely messing up my preparation for the marathon, but as long as I think I can finish it, I am doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may not be quite logical, but emotionally, in the past week, I have felt that I need to do the marathon, not so much because I have done so much for it (OK, that&amp;rsquo;s the sunk cost fallacy, I know), but because I signed up for it with an agreement with Abby that this was going to be my last marathon for 15-20 years, and lately, in light of my suffering (and her collateral suffering), I amended that to tell her that I was never going to do a marathon again, ever!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A comeback from Pittsburgh Marathon overtraining</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/04/06/comeback-from-pittsburgh-marathon-overtraining/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 06 Apr 2013 15:59:23 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/04/06/comeback-from-pittsburgh-marathon-overtraining/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I reported on running Just A Short Run, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/03/30/report-on-just-a-short-run-my-first-half-marathon-in-nine-years/&#34;&gt;my first half marathon in nine years&lt;/a&gt;. One very real concern I had &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/03/03/my-first-steel-city-road-runners-winter-5k-race/&#34;&gt;when I put this race on my calendar a month ago&lt;/a&gt; was that recovery from it might interfere with my marathon training. Although I did not race Just A Short Run all out, I did put in a hard effort, and sure enough I did end up having a really tough training week afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the overtraining this week was partly my doing. Here I explain how I ended up feeling like I was falling apart, and how I recovered and felt pretty good during today&amp;rsquo;s long run.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/wow-run.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Pittsburgh Marathon Warmup on Walnut run&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;after-the-half-marathon&#34;&gt;After the half marathon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in my report, I had some issues after the race: my right lower calf/Achilles area seized up for a bit, and also my right second and third toes did as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, a day later, I was feeling very sore in my right lower calf and second toe. I should mention that I have &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morton%27s_toe&#34;&gt;Morton&amp;rsquo;s toe&lt;/a&gt; on both feet, although my left second toe is only barely longer than the big toe, while it is my right second toe that is noticeably longer than the big toe and therefore has a real tendency to cause me some problems:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/mortons-toe.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;My Morton&amp;#39;s toes&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So I did take a day off running after the half marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;monday-trying-to-be-careful&#34;&gt;Monday: trying to be careful&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even on Monday, I was still feeling sore. I decided that I should do some light running anyway, to avoid two days off completely from running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I very much wanted to finally start running in my new Luna Sandals, which I had received last week but put aside because of the half marathon. These are the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lunasandals.com/products/33-venado&#34;&gt;Venado with ATS laces and MGT footbed&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://s3.amazonaws.com/lunastore/images/255/full.jpg?1351720427&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Luna Sandals: Venado, ATS laces, MGT footbed&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I ended up running just an easy 2 miles on the treadmill in the morning in my Vibram FiveFingers Bikila LS shoes, and then after work, running 1.5 miles in the Luna Sandals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tuesday-new-shoes&#34;&gt;Tuesday: new shoes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, I was still not yet completely recovered either from the half marathon, but I felt I was ready to go for a normal run. I decided to do a real run in the Luna Sandals and did 5 miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encountered various problems while trying out the Luna Sandals, beginning to break them in. I got chafed in various places from the straps and buckle:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/luna-sandals-2013-04-02/feet.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Feet chafed&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/luna-sandals-2013-04-02/side.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Side view&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/luna-sandals-2013-04-02/wearing.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Feet in&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/luna-sandals-2013-04-02/heel.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;View of heel&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And it was tricky keeping the sandals on at all. I fidgeted a lot with the laces to try to keep my heels from slipping. I kept on having problems with my right heel slipping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, although my calf was healing up, I was more worried about my right second toe, which seemed sore and sensitive. I noticed that my tendency to impact the second toe (after all, it is my longest toe) was causing trouble. I had not really encountered any problems until after the half marathon, but the intensity of that effort, and the fact that my Bikila LS shoes were getting worn down at the toes, must have exposed this biomechanical weakness finally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;wednesday-overexcited&#34;&gt;Wednesday: overexcited&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday, I was excited about running, and used the Luna Sandals again. I still had slippage and chafing issues, but figured that there was a break-in process. The soles were starting to shape to my feet, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I accidentally (because of taking impromptu routes in Homewood Cemetery) ran 9 miles when I had originally intended to run more like 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second toe was startling to tingle and really complain: even normal walking triggered pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;thursday-admission-of-overtraining&#34;&gt;Thursday: admission of overtraining&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday was one of those days when I truly &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/01/14/three-questions-to-ask-yourself-when-you-dont-feel-like-doing-your-scheduled-workout/&#34;&gt;had to ask myself three questions&lt;/a&gt;. I was simply feeling &lt;em&gt;exhausted&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I forced myself to completely take Thursday off from running (or strength training, for that matter), while evaluating my situation. This was no longer just about my toe, but about my overall fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I had to fix this toe problem somehow, and soon, because I had a long run planned for Saturday. So I observed myself closely while walking. I noticed that I had a tendency to do a weird retracting motion on the toe when walking, a motion I do not use on my left foot. I questioned the purpose of this reflex. I found that I could &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; not to perform the retracting motion. It was difficult to make this choice, but if I really focused, I could control how I &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; my foot. I remembered lessons from &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_technique&#34;&gt;Alexander technique&lt;/a&gt; about observing and unlearning habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I discovered the reason my right hip has sometimes felt sore: my right hip has sagged in my posture. I also found that correcting this shifted the balance of weight on my right foot, and alleviated the pressure on my second toe, shifting more weight where it should be, more toward the big toe under the ball of the foot. These were very interesting discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, I felt so tired that I decided to go ahead and cancel my Sunday plan to play in the final round of the Pittsburgh Chess League season; I had really wanted to put in one final appearance for our team, after not having actually played for us since &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/11/11/pittsburgh-chess-league-round-3-back-to-chess-after-a-month-off/&#34;&gt;last November&lt;/a&gt;, because something kept on coming up every month since then, but I had little confidence that I would be mentally alert on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;friday-still-playing-it-safe&#34;&gt;Friday: still playing it safe&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday, I was feeling energetic enough to run, but I forced myself to take another day off for the sake of my right toe. It was not easy, but I reminded myself that &lt;em&gt;not being able to do my long run&lt;/em&gt; was not worth one more missed day of training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of running, I did one rep of the Cathedral of Learning stair climb, just to get some activity in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;saturday-my-14-mile-long-run&#34;&gt;Saturday: my 14-mile long run&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, I felt my right toe had recovered sufficiently that I was going to be OK doing my planned long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Steel City Road Runners had a 10-mile run lined up starting in Shadyside after a program of dynamics warmups by Dr. Vonda Wright, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pittsburghmarathon.com/wow.asp&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Warmup on Walnut&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, outside of sponsor &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.truerunner.com/&#34;&gt;True Runner&lt;/a&gt;. My plan was to skip that program, but create a 14-mile run by running 2 miles from home to the Shadyside point and then joining the group run and then running 2 miles back home afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the 10-mile loop:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe id=&#34;mapmyfitness_route&#34; src=&#34;http://snippets.mapmycdn.com/routes/view/embedded/187175578?width=560&amp;height=400&amp;elevation=true&amp;info=true&amp;line_color=E60f0bdb&amp;rgbhex=DB0B0E&amp;distance_markers=1&amp;unit_type=imperial&amp;map_mode=TERRAIN&amp;last_updated=2013-04-01T09:44:11-04:00&#34; height=&#34;590px&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: right; padding-right: 20px;&#34;&gt;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;http://mapmyrun.com/routes/create/&#34;&gt;Create Maps&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;http://mapmyrun.com/routes/&#34;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; from 80 million at &lt;a href=&#34;http://mapmyrun.com&#34;&gt;MapMyRun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-goal&#34;&gt;My goal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal for this long run was to make it a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mcmillanrunning.com/index.php/articlePages/article/2&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;fast finish long run&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. In particular, in planning my run, I had noted that the last 5 miles of the course involved a steady uphill as well as a steeper uphill through Oakland on Forbes Avenue. In the 2003 Pittsburgh Marathon ten years ago, this uphill had proved a bit discouraging to me (because I had, frankly, gone out too fast). In any case, for psychological and physiological reasons, I wanted to do this whole uphill fast and strong in this particular workout. In the actual marathon in a month, of course, I don&amp;rsquo;t plan to run it as fast, but I did want to remember the landmarks and mental state of doing something difficult but in a relaxed way. I wanted to focus on applying my newly discovered knowledge about my posture and stride asymmetry and &amp;ldquo;run tall&amp;rdquo; up the hill, with balanced hips, while monitoring my right second toe to make sure it did not get battered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was still not comfortable with the Luna Sandals, so I fell back to the shoes I&amp;rsquo;ve been wearing for almost all of my runs in the past three months, the Bikila LS shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;showed-up-late&#34;&gt;Showed up late&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I strangely miscalculated my departure from home to run 2 miles to Aiken Avenue and Walnut Street, and showed up 4 minutes late, just as runners were already heading off. I grabbed a printed map and picked up the pace so that I could try to catch up to the 10:00 pace group. I did, realizing of course that I was making my task in the final miles of my run more difficult as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conquering-the-oakland-hill&#34;&gt;Conquering the Oakland hill&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed the Oakland hill pretty well, being very focused. I continued going hard all the way back to True Runner in Shadyside. Near the end, I felt my calves getting tight, just as in the half marathon last week when my right calf seized up after I was walking after the finish line. I thought it was very useful to have triggered this exact sensation and knowing where it was, because it meant that maybe I would be able to train my body to accept that state of fatigue (after running 12 miles) and continue. Also, the feeling cleared up fairly quickly after I stopped to walk, so I think last week the real trigger was my pointless little sprint near the end. If I avoid any sprinting during the marathon, I might well be able to avoid cramping. At least, that is the plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-decision-about-gatorade&#34;&gt;A decision about Gatorade&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I drank some more Gatorade back at Walnut Street, then ran home. I was really quite tired by this point and my stomach wasn&amp;rsquo;t feeling so great. I ate some actual food and eventually recovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this run, no gels were provided, so I drank Gatorade as my only fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my final conclusion, solidifying a thought I had last week in the half marathon: &lt;em&gt;Gatorade is bad for me&lt;/em&gt;, and I should &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; avoid it in future runs and in the Pittsburgh Marathon! It was good to learn this for sure now. In fact, it is quite possible that some of the issues I had in the 2003 Pittsburgh Marathon were a result of Gatorade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GU gel works OK for me, but according to the official &lt;a href=&#34;http://pittsburghmarathon.com/Course.asp&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Marathon fluid station table&lt;/a&gt;, GU is provided only starting at mile 9.7. Therefore, I am going to pack some gels to ingest during the first 10 miles of the marathon! I will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; drink any Gatorade!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some ill-advised overtraining and injury this week after my half marathon, I forced myself to take two days off to recover, and used the time to diagnose possible causes of my biomechanical problems. I found some good hypotheses and possible solutions, and managed a high quality &amp;ldquo;fast finish long run&amp;rdquo; and am optimistic about my continuing training for the Pittsburgh Marathon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Updated 2013-05-09 with official race videos!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until today, I had not run a half marathon in nine years. This distance had given me a lot of trouble the five times I did it in 2001-2004. So I was very anxious about running &lt;a href=&#34;http://eliterunners.com/just-a-short-run/&#34;&gt;Just A Short Run&lt;/a&gt; this morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s why I feared it, and how I ended up unexpectedly pleased with the experience, including finishing over four minutes faster than my goal time.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/just-a-short-run-2013/franklin.jpg&#34; /&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;past-participation-in-just-a-short-run&#34;&gt;Past participation in Just A Short Run&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the fifth time I participated in Just A Short Run. This race began in 2001, when &lt;a href=&#34;http://eliterunners.com/running-shoes-pittsburgh/about-running-store/&#34;&gt;Kevin Smith&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://eliterunners.com/&#34;&gt;Elite Runners and Walkers&lt;/a&gt; created in in memory of his younger brother who died of leukemia, to &lt;a href=&#34;http://eliterunners.com/just-a-short-run-about/&#34;&gt;support the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/ipDidl-_qpM&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until today I have done the Just A Short Run four times:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5K in 2001&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;half marathon in 2002&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30K in 2003 (my only DNF in my life, because I went into it sick)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5K in 2004&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;past-half-marathons&#34;&gt;Past half marathons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have only once ever partly successfully executed a half marathon race, and even then, some things went rather wrong. Here&amp;rsquo;s a summary of what went wrong in each of my half marathons up till today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ikea-montour-trail-half-marathon-2001&#34;&gt;Ikea Montour Trail half marathon, 2001&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my very first half marathon, after having run some good 5K races earlier in the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went out too fast (because of an initial downhill that got me too excited), and paid the price. I finished in 1:47:23. My splits for the 13.1 miles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6:31.94&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7:59.53&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8:09.44&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8:16.53&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8:16.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8:19.28&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8:19.64&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7:44.85&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8:01.41&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8:23.29&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8:28.72&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8:42.36&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9:17.34&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0:49.85&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was just struggling in the last miles, and very demoralized. I almost collapsed on my buddy Jude&amp;rsquo;s shoulder after I finished. Also, I had major blisters during the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;just-a-short-run-half-marathon-2002&#34;&gt;Just A Short Run half marathon, 2002&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did this race without any real training at all, just because it was there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got blisters in the race, and also had to deal with weird existential thoughts like &amp;ldquo;Why am I running this?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished in 1:49:34, but actually, the course was found to be long by about a tenth of a mile, so that number does not mean much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ikea-montour-trail-half-marathon-2002&#34;&gt;Ikea Montour Trail half marathon, 2002&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got my revenge in this race, actually training hard specifically for the distance, doing long intervals and a lot of tempo and race-pace runs. Overall I did very well, finishing in 1:38:48, but the experience was marred by some serious problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran mile 4 too fast, but since I was carefully monitoring on my watch, I slowed down for mile 5. Still, one pays the price eventually for going too fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I still was not fueling consistently. I erred by taking both water and energy drink, resulting in dilution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mile 12, my calves started cramping up and I had to stop at one point. I lost about half a minute because of this. In mile 13, I had to run conservatively to avoid cramps. It was very frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, after I finished, while getting on the shuttle bus, I cramped up quite severely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ikea-montour-trail-half-marathon-2003&#34;&gt;Ikea Montour Trail half marathon, 2003&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A total disaster. I finished in 1:45:32, which is 7:44 slower than the previous year. This was while having a 5K fitness similar to the previous year&amp;rsquo;s. Something just went wrong. I felt sluggish throughout, and I cramped up in mile 10. And I had digestive problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chamber-classic-half-marathon-2004&#34;&gt;Chamber Classic half marathon, 2004&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1:46:12. No real training for it, just did it because it was there and I had not been able to do the Montour Trail one. A fiasco, in which I struggled with my usual problems (slowing down in the final miles, cramping).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;preparation&#34;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not go into this race truly prepared to &lt;em&gt;race&lt;/em&gt; the half marathon. I know what it takes to race a half marathon for time: long tempo and race-pace runs, long intervals. I have done little of that so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hardest training run so far has been &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/03/16/18-miles-in-vibram-fivefingers-training-for-the-pittsburgh-marathon/&#34;&gt;16 miles with the Steel City Road Runners, two weeks ago, on an 18 mile course&lt;/a&gt;. I did not truly taper for the half marathon race, although this week including the race I have a reduced mileage of 25 (easy 6, easy 3, speed ladder 3, and then the race).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, what I am really training for is the Pittsburgh Marathon, but I felt that I should do a half marathon race in order to get a taste of what it is like to run in a long race. I have been doing long runs every week for a while now, so running the half marathon distance is not a problem: the challenge for me was to figure out if I could partially &lt;em&gt;race&lt;/em&gt; it, to find my limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I wanted to fix the problems I had in my previous half marathons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blistering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;going out too fast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;slowing way down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cramping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;digestive problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;blistering&#34;&gt;Blistering&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solving the problem of blistering has been trivial for me since I switched to wearing Vibram FiveFingers shoes. I just don&amp;rsquo;t get serious blisters any more; my feet have adapted completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, I just got my Luna Sandals two days ago, but have not run in them yet. Friends helpfully convinced me that it would be crazy to wear them in the race without any actual test of them (I knew that, but just needed validation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;em&gt;first half marathon&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m running in Vibram FiveFingers. Up till now, the longest distance I&amp;rsquo;ve raced in FiveFingers has been &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/09/25/blistered-but-blissful-in-the-burgh/&#34;&gt;10K, when I was still getting blistered by the Bikila LS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;going-out-too-fast&#34;&gt;Going out too fast&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By not treating this as an all-out race whose goal is to minimize time, I could afford to run more conservatively and plan on negative-splitting. I decide to target a time of 1:55:00 (reasonable given &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/03/03/my-first-steel-city-road-runners-winter-5k-race/&#34;&gt;my recent 5K&lt;/a&gt; time of 25:11), with the idea of speeding up if it felt right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;slowing-way-down&#34;&gt;Slowing way down&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I consciously carb-loaded for this half marathon and had a race fueling plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cramping&#34;&gt;Cramping&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea how to really solve this problem. I think I must be genetically predisposed to cramping. People like to claim electrolyte deficiency is the cause, but I don&amp;rsquo;t believe this at all, because I have tried loading up on electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;digestive-problems&#34;&gt;Digestive problems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have concluded that it is safest to avoid Gatorade and the like on the course because people mix it in funny proportions. Sticking with predictable gels and water is my new plan. One gel before starting the race, and then one gel every 45 minutes after that (which in the case of a half marathon means two gels on the course).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I used to drink too much water, resulting in sloshing in the stomach. So I drink less now during a race, and drink more well before it starts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-route&#34;&gt;The route&lt;/h2&gt;

Note the big hill at the beginning. Control of effort going up and down hills is critical, to avoid bad spikes in energy usage.

## The race

Here are the [official race results](http://www.runhigh.com/2013RESULTS/R033013AA.html).

### Start


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/just-a-short-run-2013/announcements.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Announcements&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


I started out with the 1:55:00 finish pacer (8:47 pace):


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/just-a-short-run-2013/pacer.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;My initial pacer&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


Going up the big hill, however, he totally lost me, as I slowed down to avoid prematurely feeling the burn. In fact, a slower pacer even passed me. No problem.

On the downhill, I quickly started regaining ground. I think after around three miles, I had caught up to the original 8:47 pacer, and then that was feeling too slow for me, so I passed him for good, and never saw a pacer again in the race.

### Gatorade error

I made an error at one of the aid stations when I mistaken grabbed Gatorade and threw it in my face. I got stickiness all over my face and the front of my jacket and fingers. It was really disgusting, actually. I will be more careful in the future to ask what stuff is before taking a cup.

Otherwise, I stuck well to my plan of taking water and two gels during the entire half marathon. Note that the race provided [e-Gel](http://www.cranksports.com/products/eGel/), which I had not had before. If I were seriously racing this half marathon, obviously I would have bought and tried this stuff on long runs ahead of time.

### Passing people

The thing about Just A Short Run is that people are running different races and therefore are at different paces, and also in such a huge race, there are always those who are inexperienced and go out too fast and slow down. What this means, in practice, is that if you are running evenly (or for a negative split, like I was doing), you will be needing to pass people constantly. It is very important to be a good judge of your own pace, because otherwise you might think you are doing OK, while the reality is you&#39;re following someone who is slowing down.

I like to target someone who looks faster than me and then try to keep up with him or her. I did this repeatedly in the race.

At one point I asked a guy what his pace was, and he said 8:30. I was feeling good, so eventually I passed him. I realized at that moment that I was going to be able to run considerably faster than 1:55:00, despite my very slow start.

### Last five miles

I maintained speed in the last 5 miles of the race; I might even have gone faster, but without the data, I cannot tell, since when fatigue sets in, effort does not equal actual pace. I was definitely getting tired, but I kept pushing, trying to pretend I was running a 10K race or something. I thought that I just might have a shot at finishing under 1:50:00. I didn&#39;t, but that&#39;s OK. I finished in 1:50:52.

The official [split data](http://www.runhigh.com/2013RESULTS/R033013AF.html) shows that I did the last 5 miles in 42:03, which is about 8:25 pace. Since I averaged 8:28 pace for the whole race, I clearly ran faster in the last 5 miles than in the first 8.1 miles.

If I had known what I was capable of, I could have run faster and more evenly from the start, and finished faster, but that was quite explicitly *not* the goal today. The goal was to finish strong, which I did.

## SPIbelt

This was my first time running a race wearing a SPIbelt. It did not cause me any trouble at all; I barely noticed it. I will wear it during the Pittsburgh Marathon, in order to have my phone on me in case of emergency. I did not use my phone during the race, only before and after it, but it&#39;s always nice to know that I can directly contact Abby if something goes wrong.

## Cramping

I did a little bit of a final sprint across the finish line. The moment I crossed was the moment when I felt both of my calves start to twitch. I realized that I almost crossed the line to full-on cramping, and decided to keep moving. I grabbed a banana and ate it while jogging slowly, and planning to jog off the heaviness in my calves.

Then disaster struck: I stubbed my right toes on the ground and instantly two of my toes cramped up and my lower right calf also cramped up. I ripped off my shoe and luckily, after about twenty seconds, I was OK again. I decided it was unsafe to keep moving, and I went upstairs in the North Park Boat House to just keep warm and stretch in a safe environment. I did not cramp up again.

So I have not entirely solved the cramping problem. Apparently sprinting was enough to push me over the edge. Also, closed-toe shoes are a problem because my toes inevitably get at least somewhat jammed in the course of running in closed-toe shoes. This is why I want to test out the Luna Sandals, which may completely prevent toe jamming and cramping. As for my calves, I don&#39;t know, maybe I just need to do more hard longer runs in order to get them accustomed to the lactic acid buildup or something.

## Post-race eating

My stomach was entirely OK during the race. No water sloshing, no indigestion, no gnawing hunger. I was hungry after finishing, of course.


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/just-a-short-run-2013/food.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Post-race food&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


I made some mistakes after finishing, however. I ate not only a banana, but also a bagel, a Smiley Cookie, a little bag of chips, and a little bag of cookies. I believe I should have excluded the bag of cookies and the chips, and saved the Smiley Cookie for later. I had some digestive discomfort (nothing serious though) for a while after everything I ate. I will remember next time. After a 5K or 10K, I can eat anything, but apparently, after a half marathon, digestion is trickier.

But it is hard not to gobble up a Smiley Cookie:


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/just-a-short-run-2013/smiley-cookie.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Smiley Cookie&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


At home, I ended up deciding to eat familiar leftovers rather than going out to a buffet as I had originally thought of doing with Abby.

## Feet

My feet were sore, but actually, less sore than after each of my long runs in the past month. I think I&#39;ve become more efficient. No knee pain either. After the race, just general inflammation. I think I&#39;ll be OK tomorrow.

&lt;/figure&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin&amp;#39;s soles of feet&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


I did get one small blister, on my right pinkie toe, but I didn&#39;t actually notice it until I was home and took a shower.

## What does all this mean for the marathon?

This [race time predictor](http://www.runnersworld.co.uk/general/rws-race-time-predictor/1681.html) suggests that given that I ran a half marathon in 1:50:52, I can do a full marathon in 3:51:08. I am, frankly, skeptical that I can go under 4:00:00 at all a month from now. I know I want to be conservative in the marathon, and I rather doubt I will be able to negative-split it, and I still have concerns about late-stage cramping or other physical deterioration. We shall see how my training progresses. I am going to start adding &#34;quality&#34; work in the form of interval training in order to toughen up.

## Thanks

Many thanks to my wife Abby, who dropped me off at the race and picked me up after visiting her parents in the vicinity, saving me driving and parking hassles! And thanks to all my friends who have been supportive while I&#39;ve been so nervous for weeks about this race!

I like to thank [Elite Runners and Walkers](http://eliterunners.com/) for putting on a really well-organized race. The instructions were very clear, volunteers giving out water, Gatorade, and gels were everywhere, there was plenty of post-race food, bag check was convenient, and everything seemed to go smoothly. I would like to take this opportunity to say that without Elite Runners and Walkers, I do not know where I would be as a runner. Back over a decade ago, when I started running, the Internet was not what it is now. I got information about running from books and magazines and word of mouth more than anything else. I was told about the new store Elite Runners and Walkers and I got some of my first running shoes and clothing there. I even bought my very first pair of Vibram FiveFingers KSO shoes there, in 2009, before minimalist shoes suddenly became more mainstream and available in other stores, and last year when I got some rips in those first Vibram FiveFingers shoes, I got a new pair of KSO shoes through them also. And the races they put on in the winter and spring are great: I used to run their [Spring Thaw](http://eliterunners.com/events/annual-spring-thaw/) as well as Just A Short Run. And when picking up my race packet at the store this week, Abby and I bought some more shirts and shorts in preparation for summer!

## Conclusion

This was my slowest half marathon ever, but one of the most satisfying, and one of the best-executed, given my actual fitness level, which is substantially lower than that of a decade ago. I may consider *really* racing a half marathon in the fall. Meanwhile, I definitely found the successful completion of this half marathon to be a confidence booster for the upcoming Pittsburgh Marathon. Yes, there is no real comparison between the two distances, but it&#39;s just the fact that this is a long race at all, compared to, say, a 5K or 10K.

## Race videos are out! (Update of 2013-05-09)

### From start to 1:30:00

#### Start

I couldn&#39;t find myself in the half marathon start, because it&#39;s too congested.

#### Additional loop 1

I found myself arriving under &#34;Additional loops&#34; at 27:09 on the clock to begin the first of two 5-mile loops.

&lt;p&gt;Since I crossed the start line after 21 seconds, I really ran 26:48 for the first 3.1 miles (average 8:39 pace).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;additional-loop-2&#34;&gt;Additional loop 2&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, watch me cross &amp;ldquo;Additional loops&amp;rdquo; at around 1:09:09 on the clock, which means I did 5 miles in 42:00 (average 8:24 pace).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(To jump immediately to the spot, click &lt;a href=&#34;http://youtu.be/BukDHKvc7rk?t=46m11s&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;from-1-31-00-to-3-21-00&#34;&gt;From 1:31:00 to 3:21:00&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;sprint-finish&#34;&gt;Sprint finish&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch my sprint finish from clock time around 1:51:03 to finish at 1:51:12 (my chip time was 1:50:51, meaning I crossed the start line after 21 seconds), which means I did the last 5 miles in 42:03, almost exactly the same time as I did the first 5-mile loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;from-3-23-00-to-4-07-00&#34;&gt;From 3:23:00 to 4:07:00&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was already done, so I am not in this video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, I did not set a goal to run a spring half marathon, so I did not train in the winter months for one, and so I am sadly missing Just A Short Run. Maybe there&amp;rsquo;s still time for me to get back into regular running and aim to do a half marathon in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My second &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.steelcityrrc.org/scrrcevents?eventId=619953&amp;amp;EventViewMode=2&amp;amp;CalendarViewType=1&amp;amp;SelectedDate=3/30/2013&#34;&gt;Saturday group training run with the Steel City Runners&lt;/a&gt; happened to be on St. Patrick&amp;rsquo;s Day weekend, and therefore took place just before the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pittsburghirish.org/parade/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh St. Patrick&amp;rsquo;s Day parade&lt;/a&gt;, which starts at 10 AM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;overtraining-and-knees&#34;&gt;Overtraining and knees&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/03/09/11-pittsburgh-bridge-crossings-in-one-12-mile-run/&#34;&gt;Last week I mentioned&lt;/a&gt; that I was having problems because of overtraining; I ran five days one week only to have to scale back to three the next. This week I consciously got in four days of running, with higher total mileage than either of the previous two weeks (when I did 26 and 23). This week, I got in 29. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy, especially given that I ran last week&amp;rsquo;s long run too hard and therefore had left knee oddness that actually lasted three days! It wasn&amp;rsquo;t so bad that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t run, but I clearly had to let it heal up, which it did in time for another long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, both of John&amp;rsquo;s knees were in serious pain the day after last week&amp;rsquo;s training run, and a week later, he is still waiting for them to heal up, and therefore did not join me for today&amp;rsquo;s training run. Oops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;plan&#34;&gt;Plan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For today&amp;rsquo;s run, I decided to run &lt;em&gt;only the first 16 miles&lt;/em&gt; and then walk the last 2 miles. Also, I joined the 10-minute pace group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that a lot of things went &amp;ldquo;wrong&amp;rdquo; on this run, but I got back to the start OK in the end!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;unknown-territory&#34;&gt;Unknown territory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wore my Vibram FiveFingers Bikila LS shoes again. This is an important test, because I have &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; been on the road for 18 miles straight in these shoes before, run or walk! I need to know whether wearing these for the Pittsburgh Marathon will work out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;weather-conditions&#34;&gt;Weather conditions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had watched the forecast all week with concern that it might be pouring rain, but I was committed to do this run regardless of conditions, because if the Pittsburgh Marathon involves running in rain, I need to be ready to deal with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that we lucked out; although it was cold, there was drizzling rain but no downpour!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/18-miles/start.jpg&#34; /&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Start of run&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-route&#34;&gt;The route&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the route of the 18-mile training run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe id=&#34;mapmyfitness_route&#34; src=&#34;http://snippets.mapmycdn.com/routes/view/embedded/180281790?width=560&amp;height=400&amp;elevation=true&amp;info=true&amp;line_color=E60f0bdb&amp;rgbhex=DB0B0E&amp;distance_markers=1&amp;unit_type=imperial&amp;map_mode=TERRAIN&amp;last_updated=2013-03-11T10:51:41-04:00&#34; height=&#34;590px&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: right; padding-right: 20px;&#34;&gt;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;http://mapmyrun.com/routes/create/&#34;&gt;Create Maps&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;http://mapmyrun.com/routes/&#34;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; from 80 million at &lt;a href=&#34;http://mapmyrun.com&#34;&gt;MapMyRun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-run&#34;&gt;The run&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with the 10-minute pace group. I actually immediately fell back, wanting to start off running more slowly,  but was never too far from the pack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;st-patrick-s-day&#34;&gt;St. Patrick&amp;rsquo;s Day&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately and throughout the run, I saw people in green who were a little loud and clearly had a bit to drink. I was amused that they were up and around already at 8 AM in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended up running on Liberty Avenue through the setup for St. Patrick&amp;rsquo;s Day parade downtown (which begins at 10 AM). We got some cheers (many of us were wearing green) as well as some jeers. It was a strange experience, and I felt a bit embarrassed to be running through parade preparation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/18-miles/st-patricks-day-parade-prep.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Pittsburgh St. Patrick&amp;#39;s Day preparation&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;first-water-stop&#34;&gt;First water stop&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the first water stop, I drank some water and grabbed a GU gel to go. I caught up to the 10-minute pace group at the first water stop, since a lot of people didn&amp;rsquo;t immediately keep going but waited for everyone to get water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My new system with gels is to take one and then eat it some minutes after drinking water, rather than immediately with water. It saves time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;big-uphill-and-losing-my-map&#34;&gt;Big uphill and losing my map&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a big uphill going east on Liberty Ave during which I lost the 10-minute pace group because I prefer to go slower uphill to maintain an even &lt;em&gt;effort&lt;/em&gt; rather than &lt;em&gt;pace&lt;/em&gt;. I always make up the loss on the downhills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;second-water-stop&#34;&gt;Second water stop&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second water stop was near mile 8 in Shadyside. I caught up yet again to the 10-minute pace group at that point, and took another GU gel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I realized that I must have lost my paper map while running up Liberty Avenue. This was bad, because although I roughly knew the route, I did not know all the details. I did have my smartphone on me, but the MapMyRun Web site did not display very well on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worse, it appeared after the second water stop that the 10-minute pace group was either going much slower or I was all &amp;ldquo;warmed up&amp;rdquo; and going much faster, because I could not tolerate their pace, and I decided I had to forge ahead into Oakland, even though there was nobody ahead that I could follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did find two other people who were willing to go at a faster pace along with me, so the three of us took off into Oakland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;birmingham-bridge&#34;&gt;Birmingham Bridge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three of us crossed the Birmingham Bridge together to the South Side. I remarked that the last time I did the Pittsburgh Marathon ten years ago, I was humbled by the uphill going &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; Oakland (in the other direction) on the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/18-miles/birmingham-bridge.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Birmingham Bridge to South Side&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;south-side-and-falling-behind&#34;&gt;South Side and falling behind&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The South Side was a total party scene, as might be expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going east on Carson Street, I suddenly noticed at around mile 11 that I had lost one of my gloves. I had taken off my gloves earlier as it was getting warmer, and put them in my pockets, but just as I had lost my map because I hadn&amp;rsquo;t zipped my jacket pockets, I had now lost a glove. I apologized to my two companions and said I was turning back to find my glove if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, my glove was just a block back, and a group of runners saw it and picked it up and gave it to me. But now my two companions were far away from me. I could still see them, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to run super fast just to catch them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;three-rivers-heritage-trail-and-getting-lost&#34;&gt;Three Rivers Heritage Trail and getting lost&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw my companions turn onto the Three Rivers Heritage Trail. At this point, I no longer knew exactly what the rest of the route was for the last 8 miles. I knew that there was a water/gel stop at some point in the next 7 miles before the West End Bridge, but had no idea where it was!! I really didn&amp;rsquo;t want to miss the final water/gel stop, since that would mean going 8 miles without any water or fuel. Of course, I did have some money on me, so I could stop somewhere to refuel, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t really want to stop if I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I&amp;rsquo;d run around 12 miles and my feet were definitely sore. It was a huge relief to be running on the trail, actually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I made a mistake. I suddenly saw what seemed to be a water stop because a bunch of runners were gathering there. I approached and asked if it was the Steel City Road Runners water stop and they said no, it was Elite Runners and Walkers. They offered to give me some water anyway, but I declined, which was a mistake, because during the seconds I spent on this detour, I lost sight of my two companions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kept on running on the trail but they were just gone, and I never saw them again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;running-to-the-west-end-bridge&#34;&gt;Running to the West End Bridge&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just kept on running west, figuring I would eventually get to the West End Bridge. I went through Station Square and made it across the West End Bridge. Now, I had planned ahead of time to stop running shortly after crossing the West End Bridge, because it was going to be 16 miles then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I started feeling cold, and so I did some run/walking east all the way back to the start. It was very lonely going the last 8 miles of the route alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;safe-and-warm&#34;&gt;Safe and warm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made it back OK. I grabbed two energy bars and went inside to get warm and stretch and devour the two energy bars. My feet were totally killing me, but I had survived 18 miles on them in Vibram FiveFingers Bikila LS shoes. I still have no idea whether I can last a whole marathon in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-feet&#34;&gt;My feet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although my feet are sore, everything seems to be OK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;photos&#34;&gt;Photos&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/steelcityrrc&#34;&gt;Steel City Road Runners Facebook site&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.425827677512050.1073741827.391728257588659&amp;amp;type=1&#34;&gt;photo album of the St. Patrick&amp;rsquo;s Day run&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran about 16 miles of the 18-mile route, as planned, but got lost, which I did not plan. I learned some lessons. In the future, I am zipping my jacket pockets, and I am also studying the printed map thoroughly before starting one of these runs. My super-sore feet have me worried about running the marathon in Vibram FiveFingers, so I will investigate alternatives. I&amp;rsquo;m still waiting for my order this week of &lt;a href=&#34;http://lunasandals.com/&#34;&gt;Luna Sandals&lt;/a&gt; to come in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I&amp;rsquo;m thankful that Steel City Road Runners made it possible for me to do such a long run without feeling completely alone, and not having to haul all the water and fuel I needed during and after the run. Ten years ago when I was marathon training, I did carry along everything I needed, but it really is much nicer to simulate actual race conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am grateful that when I was done and called home, Abby baked a pizza for us to share when I got back. Fuel! Abby has been understanding and supportive during my training for the Pittsburgh Marathon. She thinks it&amp;rsquo;s a crazy thing to do, and it is, but I want to do it this once again while I have the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>11 Pittsburgh bridge crossings in one 12-mile run</title>

        &lt;img src=&#34;http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/602768_422297731198378_798317370_n.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;View from Mount Washington&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My first ever &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.steelcityrrc.org/scrrcevents?eventId=568739&amp;amp;EventViewMode=2&amp;amp;CalendarViewType=1&amp;amp;SelectedDate=3/16/2013&#34;&gt;Steel City Road Runners Saturday morning training run&lt;/a&gt; was a 12-mile run. My office mate John went with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time I ran as far as 12 miles &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/02/24/2013-pittsburgh-marathon-training-progress-since-signing-up-three-weeks-ago/&#34;&gt;was in February&lt;/a&gt;, so I expected to do OK. The important difference is that I have been increasing my weekly mileage. I had a monster training week last week, going up from 13 miles to 26 miles last week, the &lt;em&gt;largest&lt;/em&gt; training volume I have had in a single week in years. I&amp;rsquo;ll confess that this has taken a toll on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, I have backed off this week, such that including this 12-mile run (I will not run tomorrow), this week I will have 23 miles. In the long haul, &lt;em&gt;overtraining&lt;/em&gt; is a huge waste of time and energy. Unfortunately, in my attempt to &amp;ldquo;catch up&amp;rdquo; some because of the marathon coming in less than two months, I did in fact overtrain to an extent; last week I ran five out of seven days in order to reach that mileage of 26. This week, I tried to up the mileage but felt tired and wisely decided to rest when I needed to, even though that meant this week I ran only three days! Obviously, in retrospect, it would have been wiser to run four days last week and four this week, with better overall training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I did enjoy today&amp;rsquo;s training run. It involved the most bridge crossings I have ever done in my life in a single day (by foot or otherwise): eleven!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my report on the training run, including, of course, photos of bridge crossings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sign-in&#34;&gt;Sign in&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John and I signed in at 8 AM. It was going to be a beautiful, sunny day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We received printed maps of the route. I did have my smartphone with me, wearing it in my SPIbelt, so I felt pretty safe about knowing where I am or where to go in case I got lost.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/11-pittsburgh-bridge-crossings/sign-in.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Steel City Road Runners sign in&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There is indoor access to restrooms, water fountains, and warmth at these Steel City Road Runners training run meetings. Very nice for winter!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were designated pacers. I was uncertain about which pace group I should join, if any at all. I felt that probably the 10-minute pace group might be on the slow side, but definitely I did not expect to keep up with the 9-minute pace group for a long run. But we decided to start off with the 9-minute pace group and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/11-pittsburgh-bridge-crossings/pace-groups.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Pacers&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I wore my Vibram FiveFingers Bikila LS shoes, which have been my main running shoes all winter (when there is no snow or water on the ground):&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/11-pittsburgh-bridge-crossings/vibram-fivefingers-bikila-ls.jpg&#34; /&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-route&#34;&gt;The route&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the route of the 12-mile training run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe id=&#34;mapmyfitness_route&#34; src=&#34;http://snippets.mapmycdn.com/routes/view/embedded/178234904?width=560&amp;height=400&amp;elevation=true&amp;info=true&amp;line_color=E60f0bdb&amp;rgbhex=DB0B0E&amp;distance_markers=1&amp;unit_type=imperial&amp;map_mode=TERRAIN&amp;last_updated=2013-03-08T12:47:36-06:00&#34; height=&#34;590px&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: right; padding-right: 20px;&#34;&gt;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;http://mapmyrun.com/routes/create/&#34;&gt;Create Maps&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;http://mapmyrun.com/routes/&#34;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; from 80 million at &lt;a href=&#34;http://mapmyrun.com&#34;&gt;MapMyRun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-bridge-crossings&#34;&gt;The bridge crossings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 9-minute pace group was clearly going too fast for me. I hung off the back hoping to simply keep them in sight as they kept getting more ahead of me. To my surprise, John went with the group, even though he has not run in months. I was not sure it was wise of him not to have done any running before this training run, and am worried about his going too fast all of a sudden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see downtown Pittsburgh:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;first-water-stop-and-getting-lost&#34;&gt;First water stop and getting lost!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first water stop was after 4 miles:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/11-pittsburgh-bridge-crossings/first-water-stop.jpg&#34; /&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;First water stop&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;By the time I had reached this water stop, John and the rest of the 9-minute pace group were way ahead of me and barely visible. Unfortunately, after I drank some Gatorade, I noticed that I didn&amp;rsquo;t see them at all any more. So for almost the rest of the run, the following 8 miles, I was mostly alone! This was disconcerting because it meant that I&amp;rsquo;d have to try to follow the printed map and directions, and avoid getting lost. It would turn out that I would get lost a couple of times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;10th-street-bridge-inbound&#34;&gt;10th Street Bridge, inbound&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving the South Side:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;liberty-bridge-outbound&#34;&gt;Liberty Bridge, outbound&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not having anyone to follow, I got confused about how to get onto the Liberty Bridge, missing the steps, and had to do some backtracking to find the way to get on.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/11-pittsburgh-bridge-crossings/liberty-bridge-outbound.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;On Liberty Bridge outbound&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;to-mount-washington&#34;&gt;To Mount Washington&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This training run featured a big, long uphill to Mount Washington, with a water stop at the very top!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/11-pittsburgh-bridge-crossings/to-mount-washington.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;To Mount Washington&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After being alone for quite some time, I did encounter John and other runners coming back down Mount Washington when I was still going up. They were going really fast downhill!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/11-pittsburgh-bridge-crossings/up-to-mount-washington.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Uphill to Mount Washington&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;second-water-stop&#34;&gt;Second water stop&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My phone started acting funny when I got to the water stop at the top of Mount Washington, so I did not bother to try take any more photos after that. I was bummed that I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a photo of the view of Pittsburgh from the top, but someone did and posted it on Facebook, so here it is:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/602768_422297731198378_798317370_n.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;View from Mount Washington&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At this water stop, at mile 9, I felt hungry, and saw some GU gels, and took one and ate it before continuing my run. It was &lt;a href=&#34;http://guenergy.com/products/products-roctane-gels&#34;&gt;GU Roctane&lt;/a&gt;. I didn&amp;rsquo;t look at the ingredients till after I got home and did a Web search on it. That explained a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While running down from Mount Washington, I felt a surge of energy and decided to run really, really fast, in hope of possibly catching sight of John at some point. In fact, I did not see any runner again for the next 3 miles until I reached the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;back-across-the-liberty-bridge-inbound&#34;&gt;Back across the Liberty Bridge, inbound&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then running through downtown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;16th-street-bridge-outbound&#34;&gt;16th Street Bridge outbound&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was kind of zoned out and missed the turn onto the bridge because I was just running fast, but luckily, I was off by just a block before I realized my mistake and backtracked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-end&#34;&gt;The end&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got back to the start in a bit less than two hours, so given my rest stops and getting lost, I definitely averaged under 10-minute pace. But I was definitely not running anywhere near 9-minute pace. I&amp;rsquo;ll keep that in my mind for the next training run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John had finished well before me, but he himself had gotten lost near the end also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We snacked on provided orange slices and chips:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/11-pittsburgh-bridge-crossings/after.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Steel City Road Runners snacks&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/11-pittsburgh-bridge-crossings/franklin.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then I drove us back to our places. After both of us had showered and changed, we met up for lunch buffet at Coriander India Grill, a favorite place to eat &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/02/26/snowing-means-sambar-at-coriander-india-grill/&#34;&gt;after getting very hungry after a lot of exercise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-next&#34;&gt;What next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week will be an 18-mile training run. As I have mentioned, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/02/24/2013-pittsburgh-marathon-training-progress-since-signing-up-three-weeks-ago/&#34;&gt;I do not intend to actually do such a long run&lt;/a&gt;, so I will think of a good way to run 16 miles instead: either I start walking earlier, or I walk near the end. And for sure, I will start with the 10-minute pace group rather than then 9-minute pace group. These training runs are not races. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to run too fast. In fact, I&amp;rsquo;m worried that I ran the last 3 miles today too fast, especially downhill from Mount Washington. My left knee is feeling a little funny. I hope it will recover after a day of rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve started to figure out the gel thing. I used eat gels a decade ago, but stopped because I had no reason to, but on these long runs, they do help, and I have to start planning what to use for fuel in the Pittsburgh Marathon, which will officially supply GU gel and Gatorade. I did learn, after the fact, that GU Roctane contains an insane amount of caffeine, and that&amp;rsquo;s probably what got me all hopped up to run super fast, but to my detriment today. So I need to be careful if I use Roctane in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a very instructive and tiring training run. I have a long way to go before being ready for the marathon in less than two months, but am happy to have finally joined a group training run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m very grateful for the opportunity to train with the Steel City Road Runners. Sometimes, it is much easier to commit to getting up early and going for a long run when you know that you&amp;rsquo;ll have company, that there will be support (in the form of a planned route and aid stations). Even for an introvert like me who usually prefers to run alone, the unique pains of marathon training cause me to value camaraderie for some tough runs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My first Steel City Road Runners winter 5K race</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/03/03/my-first-steel-city-road-runners-winter-5k-race/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 03 Mar 2013 18:33:03 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/03/03/my-first-steel-city-road-runners-winter-5k-race/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was the first time I ever ran Vibram FiveFingers for a winter race! As planned &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/02/24/2013-pittsburgh-marathon-training-progress-since-signing-up-three-weeks-ago/&#34;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;, I ran in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.steelcityrrc.org/scrrcevents?eventId=620982&amp;amp;EventViewMode=2&amp;amp;CalendarViewType=1&amp;amp;SelectedDate=3/16/2013&#34;&gt;Steel City Road Runners 5K race&lt;/a&gt; to gauge my current fitness level while training for the 2013 Pittsburgh Marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a little disappointed by how &amp;ldquo;slow&amp;rdquo; I ran, but actually, given the amount of training I&amp;rsquo;ve had so far this winter, I&amp;rsquo;m not doing too badly.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/scrrc-5k-2013-03-04/franklin-finish.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin finishing 5K&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(explanation of misleading clock time below)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-route&#34;&gt;The route&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The route was actually kind of a complement to the &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/pretty-good-race/&#34;&gt;Pretty Good Race 5K&lt;/a&gt; course, overlapping the turnaround point of that race but on the same trail in Schenley Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe id=&#34;mapmyfitness_route&#34; src=&#34;http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/embedded/176780548?width=560&amp;height=400&amp;&amp;line_color=7f0000ff&amp;distance_markers=1&amp;map_mode=TERRAIN&#34; height=&#34;420px&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: right; padding-right: 20px;&#34;&gt;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;http://mapmyrun.com/routes/create/&#34;&gt;Create Maps&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;http://mapmyrun.com/routes/&#34;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; from 80 million at &lt;a href=&#34;http://mapmyrun.com&#34;&gt;MapMyRun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;shoes&#34;&gt;Shoes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because there is still some snow (and ice and mud) on the ground in the trails, I wore my &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/08/28/five-reasons-we-just-stocked-up-on-vibram-fivefingers-kso-trek-shoes/&#34;&gt;Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek shoes&lt;/a&gt;. Also, because of the cold temperature and the water on the ground, I wore Injinji socks, to prevent frostbite! For any run longer than a 5K, I would not even wear the FiveFingers with socks at this temperature. But I figured that I would generate enough heat during a 5K to keep my toes sufficiently warm to avoid frostbite even when wet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-race&#34;&gt;The race&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;before-the-race&#34;&gt;Before the race&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I happened to bump into &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/02/20/pittsburgh-chess-club-championship-2013-round-6-winning-as-black-like-a-madman/&#34;&gt;Kurt&lt;/a&gt;, who said he was there because his daughter was running in the race. Pittsburgh is small; I always keep encountering familiar faces in new contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encountered Pattye Stragar, who is so instrumental in the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/02/08/public-shame-a-great-way-to-maintain-a-habit/&#34;&gt;fitness program at CMU&lt;/a&gt;, and in publicizing the Pittsburgh Marathon and the Steel City Road Runners, and notifying the CMU community of the special deal that I ended up taking advantage of. I asked her if she was doing the marathon and she said she did it the year it came back (it was canceled 2004-2008 and came back in 2009) and she was done with marathons.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://pbs.twimg.com/media/BEek8kdCYAAcX2v.jpg:large&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Pattye Stragar and others&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;during-the-race&#34;&gt;During the race&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, my feet did get wet, but I did not have any problems with them freezing. Also, although there were some slippery, icy spots and wet, muddy spots on the trails, they were not too bad. After I got home, my shoes and socks looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/scrrc-5k-2013-03-04/vibram-and-injinji.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Shoes and socks afterwards&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The race course was hilly and not so easy, even if it weren&amp;rsquo;t slippery out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After about the first mile, I noticed a guy running around my pace ahead of me. I decided he was going to be my target to beat in the race. There was plenty of time to make up the gap. It turned out that I actually passed him at one point, but later he passed me; I am used to this kind of thing because I tend to run downhills much better than I run uphills. In the final quarter mile or so, I took off and passed him for the last time. You can see him way back in this photo of me crossing the finish line:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/scrrc-5k-2013-03-04/franklin-finish.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin finishing 5K&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;An explanation about the clock: the race was held in two ways, with bib numbers 1-50 arbitrarily assigned to the first wave, then the rest (including me) assigned to the second wave two minutes later, to avoid congestion on the trails. So in fact, my official finish time was 25:11. I&amp;rsquo;d hoped I would be in shape to run faster than that, but this number is important real data to have, in forming my expectations for how fast I might be able to do the Pittsburgh Marathon. I think it is unlikely I&amp;rsquo;ll be in shape to attempt a four-hour marathon in two months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/steelcityrrc&#34;&gt;Steel City Road Runners Facebook site&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.419910474770437.1073741825.391728257588659&amp;amp;type=1&#34;&gt;photo album of the race&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;after-the-race&#34;&gt;After the race&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was water set out for us to drink after the race. Also, bags of potato chips, plates of cookies, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dibellas.com/&#34;&gt;DiBella&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; subs! Tasty and filling!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the Steel City Road Runners for putting on this race, having the people on the course to direct us, and feeding us afterwards! I had a really fun experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;signing-up-for-another-race&#34;&gt;Signing up for another race&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, a couple of days ago I decided to commit to doing &lt;a href=&#34;http://eliterunners.com/just-a-short-run/&#34;&gt;Just A Short Run&lt;/a&gt; in late March. I will be doing the half marathon version of it as a final checkpoint of my fitness before the marathon, which is a month later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be my first half marathon race in nine years: my last half marathon was in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have actually done Just A Short Run four times in my life so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2001: I did the 5K&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2002: I did the half marathon (the course ended up actually a bit long)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2003: I attempted the 30K as part of training for the 2003 Pittsburgh Marathon, but I was very ill and dropped out after running around 13 miles (my only DNF)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2004: I did the 5K&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not know yet whether I will be &lt;em&gt;racing&lt;/em&gt; Just A Short Run or just using it as part of training. &lt;em&gt;Objectively&lt;/em&gt;, I should not be all-out racing such a distance while marathon training, because recovery from racing a half marathon will only cut into valuable marathon training time. However, there may be psychological benefits in doing well in a half marathon, if I am sufficiently fit to attempt that. I will decide when the time is nearer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not doing any other races, because they would interfere with my long run progression plans. I will wait until after the marathon to enjoy training for and running 5K and 10K races. So this year I&amp;rsquo;m going to skip the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.marthadixon.org/&#34;&gt;Martha&amp;rsquo;s Run 10K&lt;/a&gt; that I&amp;rsquo;ve only ever done once (in 2004), as well as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.montourtrail.org/events/displayevent.asp?id=1&#34;&gt;Burgh&amp;rsquo;s Pizza and Wings Pub 10K&lt;/a&gt; that I also did once (in 2004). Since I&amp;rsquo;m not going to be doing the Pittsburgh Marathon again next year, maybe next year I can run these races.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-of-2013-03-30&#34;&gt;(Update of 2013-03-30)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up partially racing Just A Short Run, which I think was the correct decision. I had a &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/03/30/report-on-just-a-short-run-my-first-half-marathon-in-nine-years/&#34;&gt;great experience&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing my first 5K race this year was a confidence booster for me, being a hard workout. It was also an opportunity to start really quantifying my progress and realistic timeline of improvement over the next months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-of-2014-03-01&#34;&gt;(Update of 2014-03-01)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not run in 2014&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.steelcityrrc.org/events?eventId=797046&amp;amp;EventViewMode=EventDetails&#34;&gt;Steel City Road Runners Campus Challenge 5K&lt;/a&gt;, sadly, because I have not been running much this winter, thanks to not signing up for either the Pittsburgh Marathon (or half marathon) or even for the annual CMU Fitness Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why and how I am going to run the 2013 Pittsburgh Marathon</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/01/30/why-and-how-i-am-going-to-run-the-2013-pittsburgh-marathon/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Jan 2013 20:31:41 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/01/30/why-and-how-i-am-going-to-run-the-2013-pittsburgh-marathon/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I surprised myself by deciding suddenly to run the &lt;a href=&#34;http://pittsburghmarathon.com/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Marathon&lt;/a&gt; this year, 2013. This was not part of the plan when I was &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/12/31/why-i-went-frick-park-trail-running-in-snowfall-for-the-first-time-in-a-decade/&#34;&gt;thinking about my running plans for 2013 a month ago&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be my second Pittsburgh Marathon, because the last time I ran it was in 2003, and that was my first marathon ever. It was quite an ordeal to finish, because of a lot of rookie mistakes, but I made it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I am in 2003 near the finish line (photo courtesy of my sister Linda):&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And here I am wearing my medal for finishing in 2003:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin inside with medal&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So: why am I running the Pittsburgh Marathon again, &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, ten years later? What do I hope to accomplish? And how?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why&#34;&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;do-it-better&#34;&gt;Do it better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2003, I ran my first marathon for a variety of reasons, and trained in certain ways, had certain expectations. I will write in depth later about that first marathon, because one reason I am running the Pittsburgh Marathon again now is to &lt;em&gt;do everything better&lt;/em&gt; this time, with the benefit of experience and new self-knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maintain a smart pace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finish strong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid leg muscle cramping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid foot blistering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conquer the hills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sharp contrast to my first marathon, I do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; plan to race this marathon as fast as I can. That blew up on me, and I do not have the time or desire to maximize my marathon performance at this point in my life. I do want to run strong, but not maximally. So I am not almost certainly not going to run faster than I did ten years ago; I am specifically expecting to run &lt;em&gt;slower&lt;/em&gt; but to have a &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; overall experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will not be the second time I run a marathon distance; I have done that two or three times on my own while training for the &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/rachel-carson-trail-challenge/&#34;&gt;Rachel Carson Trail Challenge&lt;/a&gt; and have also run just over a marathon distance in the annual Sammy&amp;rsquo;s Birthday Run (a 6-hour ultra event) in 2006 and 2008. But those I did pretty slowly just for training and fun, in well over four hours. In the 2013 Pittsburgh Marathon, I&amp;rsquo;d like to finish close to the completely arbitrary magic number of 4:00:00. This is very low priority compared to the other goals, but it&amp;rsquo;s useful to have a little bit of ambition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;experiment&#34;&gt;Experiment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides what I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; now that I didn&amp;rsquo;t, there are also things that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know then and still don&amp;rsquo;t know now, but have hypotheses about. So the experience will be an opportunity to test my hypotheses. In particular, the kind of exercise and diet I follow now different in various ways from ten years ago. I do a lot more core and strength training and less endurance training. So my main goal, in fact, is to run this marathon with relatively &lt;em&gt;low mileage&lt;/em&gt;. Instead of spending huge amounts of time and energy banging out the miles in training, I want to try ways of getting in really high-quality training that will enable me to handle the marathon distance better and gut it out through strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;social&#34;&gt;Social&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first Pittsburgh Marathon experience had me running all alone. I did have support as far as my sister coming to town and my friend Nathaniel watching me and cheering me on at certain points along the course, but out there, I was alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, I decided not to do the marathon unless I had at least a friend or two joining me. I got my office mate John to sign up (he also did the marathon over a decade ago). &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.runoverit.com/&#34;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt; is signed up for it, although he actually has yet to run his first marathon, which will be coming up in March. There are a bunch of others I also know who will be running. I guess when time comes, we&amp;rsquo;ll figure out how our likely paces might coincide (or not).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;it-will-be-on-my-birthday&#34;&gt;It will be on my birthday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can I say: it will be my very first race of any distance run &lt;em&gt;on my birthday&lt;/em&gt;. I thought it would be amusing and cool to celebrate my birthday by running the Pittsburgh Marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;discount&#34;&gt;Discount&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As staff at CMU, I (and my office mate John) get a &lt;a href=&#34;http://athletics.cmu.edu/fitness/fitkit2013&#34;&gt;special discount for the Pittsburgh Marathon&lt;/a&gt;. This explains why I registered today, right before the deadline!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the reduced registration fee, part of the deal is &amp;ldquo;Special access to private finish line tent with gourmet food, private massages, and more!&amp;rdquo; as well as 6 months free membership to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.steelcityrrc.org/&#34;&gt;Steel City Road Runners&lt;/a&gt;. Not bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;update-of-2013-03-16&#34;&gt;(Update of 2013-03-16)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should note that the Steel City Road Runners was formed in 2011. John and I had in fact attended its &amp;ldquo;kick-off party&amp;rdquo; on Tuesday, September 13, 2011 where we did a free training run, but we ended up not joining the club or participating further, since we were not planning to do the Pittsburgh Marathon in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how&#34;&gt;How?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;rsquo;t actually much time before the marathon (three months), so I have to be smart about training and try to avoid setbacks. Some things I need to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;immediately start extending the distance of my runs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continue core and strength training&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep up stair climbing and hill running&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build up to some rigorous interval training&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;schedule long races to run in before the marathon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cut back on various commitments in the next three months&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;removing-chess&#34;&gt;Removing chess&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve already decided on one major activity I am going to cut out: after I finish the current Tuesday night chess tournament, the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/02/04/pittsburgh-chess-club-championship-2013-round-3-attack-defense-and-sacrifices/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Chess Club Championship&lt;/a&gt;, I will take a break and not play in any more Tuesday night chess tournaments until possibly the fall (in summer I&amp;rsquo;d rather be playing outside in the sun rather than hunched over a chess board indoors!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time and energy are limited. We can&amp;rsquo;t do everything all the time. In fact, as things are, I have not even been able to play in the monthly &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitt.edu/~schach/ChessPA/ChessLeague/wpapcl.htm&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Chess League&lt;/a&gt; team matches since &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/11/11/pittsburgh-chess-league-round-3-back-to-chess-after-a-month-off/&#34;&gt;November&lt;/a&gt;: in December I was occupied with &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/12/02/oblivion-obsession-time-to-start-playing-melodica/&#34;&gt;music rehearsal&lt;/a&gt;, and just now in January I was coming off a hard week during which I was &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/01/25/notes-on-exercising-while-sick-or-tired/&#34;&gt;sick and overbooked&lt;/a&gt;. I do hope to make it to the February team match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m doing well in the Pittsburgh Chess Club Championship so far, with a perfect score in my first three rounds, so I hope I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to say goodbye while winning it after another three rounds!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;footwear&#34;&gt;Footwear&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost certainly I will wear my &lt;em&gt;worn-out and holey&lt;/em&gt; pair of &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/08/28/five-reasons-we-just-stocked-up-on-vibram-fivefingers-kso-trek-shoes/&#34;&gt;Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek shoes&lt;/a&gt;. The reason is that I have &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; been blistered wearing these shoes, no matter the distance. The leather is really comfortable for me. And I will wear the worn-out pair rather than a newer pair because on the roads, I don&amp;rsquo;t want the deeply lugged outsoles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other alternative I thought about was wearing huaraches such as my &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/09/30/running-my-10th-great-race-10k-obscene-but-in-a-good-way/&#34;&gt;Xero Shoes that I wore in the Great Race 10K&lt;/a&gt;. I will do some experiments in the spring running much longer distances than 10K in huaraches, but I am currently very skeptical about running an entire marathon in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m excited to be back for marathon running. I hope to have a stimulating adventure in the next three months as I train for and participate in the 2013 Pittsburgh Marathon!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Winter running in Vibram FiveFingers shoes: revisited</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/01/17/winter-running-in-vibram-fivefingers-shoes-revisited/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Jan 2013 11:22:48 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/01/17/winter-running-in-vibram-fivefingers-shoes-revisited/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/01/02/new-experiment-for-a-new-year-winter-running-in-vibram-fivefingers-shoes/&#34;&gt;Last year I wrote about experimenting with winter running in Vibram FiveFingers shoes&lt;/a&gt;. The experiment basically failed, once it got too cold or snowy/icy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, because it has been &amp;ldquo;warm&amp;rdquo; (for example, today it was 37 degrees F), the story has been different. I have been able sometimes to run outside on the roads in my Vibram FiveFingers Bikila LS shoes, and without socks, even.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the conditions under which I am able to do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;temperature above freezing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no ice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no puddles of melted or melting water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;running on roads or sidewalks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One drawback is that even when the trails of Frick Park are runnable (with a bit of residual snow and ice), wearing FiveFingers out there is not advisable. &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/12/31/why-i-went-frick-park-trail-running-in-snowfall-for-the-first-time-in-a-decade/&#34;&gt;I wear standard mono-toed shoes when trail running now&lt;/a&gt; if I do it at all.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/vibram-winter-2013-01-12.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Vibram Bikila LS by ice&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/vibram-winter-frick-2013-01-12.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Vibram Bikila LS by ice on Frick trail&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As long as there are no cold water or ice danger issues, I will experiment with continuing to run in FiveFingers shoes, adding Injinji socks when it gets colder.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introducing a friend to the joys of trail running in Frick Park</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/10/13/introducing-a-friend-to-the-joys-of-trail-running-in-frick-park/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 Oct 2012 23:14:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/10/13/introducing-a-friend-to-the-joys-of-trail-running-in-frick-park/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I had the special pleasure of introducing a friend to the joys of trail running in Frick Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all started with a casual comment Chris made in late August that he was thinking of doing some distance work in Frick Park, to get a change of scenery from where he lives and runs, south of Pittsburgh. I said, &amp;ldquo;Hey, let&amp;rsquo;s do this together&amp;rdquo;, and looking at our schedules, we determined that today would be the first day we could sync up for a long run in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically, we had this run planned a month and a half ago. And luckily, the weather was great today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was our first run together, outside of our both having just last week run in the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/10/06/the-fineview-stepathon-2012-pittsburghs-grueling-urban-trail-race/&#34;&gt;Fineview Stepathon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in August, Chris had warned me that he might be slow. I said that I did long runs slowly in any case, only speeding up near the end. What I didn&amp;rsquo;t say was that I fully believed that with the training he&amp;rsquo;s been doing toward the goals of his first 10K (which he has done: he did the &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/great-race/&#34;&gt;Great Race 10K&lt;/a&gt; this year), his first half marathon, and his first marathon, he was going to get fast in just a matter of months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I was right! We ended up running 13 miles, and not very slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-planned-route&#34;&gt;The planned route&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a basic idea of where to show Chris around in Frick Park. By coincidence, almost exactly a year ago, I actually did a writeup about a &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/15/snapshots-of-pittsburgh-from-a-12-mile-run/&#34;&gt;favorite long run of mine in Frick&lt;/a&gt;. I figured that we might do a subset of that run, around 10 miles, this morning. We&amp;rsquo;d improvise to cut the run short or add to it, based on how we were feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conditions&#34;&gt;Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The temperature started at around 36 F, but was slated to go over 50 F by the time we expected to be done, and it was sunny. It was perfect fall running conditions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-experiment-today&#34;&gt;My experiment today&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I have mentioned lately, I have been experimenting, with great success, with &lt;em&gt;fasting&lt;/em&gt; before running in races. Today I extended the experiment by fasting, for the &lt;em&gt;first time&lt;/em&gt; in my life, before doing a long run. I have often fasted before doing a run up to 6 miles, but not much longer than that. Typically, for a long run, I eat something before heading out, and bring a snack of some kind to eat at some point after about an hour. But I have always wondered whether eating (especially any carbs) was just training my body to depend on carbs, etc. What if I could train my body to just go into fat-burning mode and stay there, by avoiding carbs and avoiding food altogether?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today, I didn&amp;rsquo;t eat before the long run, and although I brought a snack as insurance in case I bonked, I wanted to see how I would feel for the entire duration of a long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-run&#34;&gt;The run&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started off at around 10-minute pace for the first hour of the run, taking the Riverview Trail (winding all the way down), the Falls Ravine Trail down into Fern Hollow, then crossing Commercial Street and going up to Summerset at Frick and back down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;rsquo;t go into Duck Hollow because there was a barrier with a sign saying that the section of trail was closed. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know whether to believe that (I&amp;rsquo;ve seen that sign there for a long time now), but didn&amp;rsquo;t want to run into any possible trouble, so we turned back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once back in Frick Park, Chris picked up the pace, to about 9-minute pace. OK. He was running faster than I would have chosen to run myself if I had been on a long run alone. I silently kept up. One thing about running with other people is figuring out what shared pace to adopt. If individuals have fitness levels that are too different, running together might not work too well. In our case, it appeared that Chris was rapidly closing in on my level, and for all I knew, could already be beyond it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, since we had cut short the route that would have led to the Monongahela River, I decided we&amp;rsquo;d do more exploration within Frick Park. We took the Nine Mile Run Trail down to where it emerges in Regent Square, then came back up, then turned onto Braddock Trail. We got off Braddock Trail at the point where the annual &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/08/25/my-eighth-time-doing-run-around-the-square-5k/&#34;&gt;Run Around The Square&lt;/a&gt; turns onto it, and headed back into Fern Hollow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we went up north on Tranquil Trail, branched off Homewood Trail to pass by the Frick Park Lawn Bowling Greens, see Homewood Cemetery, and head back down. By then, I calculated that we should head back, because we were going to have done about 12 miles total by the time we got back to my place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going up Falls Ravine Trail, I finally started feeling hungry. But I was OK, not lightheaded or bonking, so I did not eat the snack I had brought. This was already the furthest I&amp;rsquo;d ever run in my life completely without pre-run food or any fuel during the run (I had two or three water fountain stops but that&amp;rsquo;s no calories).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking the Riverview Trail, we reached a point at which I told Chris I liked to go fast for a whole mile uphill, so I sped up and went for it. I was going at under 8-minute pace as though running the last mile of a 10K race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point near the end of that uphill stretch, Chris called for me to wait up. He had gotten some stomach cramps. He said he wasn&amp;rsquo;t used to running at this speed. We walked for a bit before we resumed running out of the park and back to my place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;analysis&#34;&gt;Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By my estimate, based on my pretty good feel for my pace and subtracting time at water fountains and walking, we ran about 13 miles. My feet were pretty sore (I wore my Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek shoes, as usual in the trails), but I was feeling great; and I hadn&amp;rsquo;t eaten anything since dinner the previous night! OK, I was hungry and ready to eat a meal, but I had not bonked or anything. This gives me some confidence to try more fasting experiments in future runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told Chris that I believed he was fundamentally strong and could run really fast, that he should add long interval training sessions to his current regimen of long runs and hilly speed training. It&amp;rsquo;s the long intervals (running about a mile at 5K pace) that do wonders. We had just gone out and practically run a half marathon casually, so for his first half marathon coming up in months, he should be able to train well and actually set an ambitious time goal for it. I would not be surprised if in his first half marathon he is able to run faster than in my fastest ever half marathon! Put in the long runs and the interval training and one should be able to &lt;em&gt;race&lt;/em&gt; one&amp;rsquo;s first half marathon, not merely finish it. In my experience, if one has done enough training for a half marathon, it can be raced almost as though a &amp;ldquo;long&amp;rdquo; version of a 10K race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The marathon is another story entirely. I may write something up about that some day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a beautiful day for a long run in Frick Park, and I was delighted to introduce Chris to some of my favorite routes in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I was pleased that my experiment with fasting worked out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
