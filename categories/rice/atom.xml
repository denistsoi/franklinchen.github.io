      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I found out I had been eating
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_muffin&#34;&gt;English muffins&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; my whole life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-story&#34;&gt;The story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning, while at breakfast in a hotel before Abby and I were
checking out before returning home, I suddenly decided I might as well
change things up and eat my egg and sausage patties inside the halves
of an English muffin (yesterday I had eaten them alone, and an
uninspiring crappy plain bagel on the side).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was about to bite into my sandwich, Abby interrupted me and said,
&amp;ldquo;You need to toast the English muffin.&amp;rdquo; I said, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve never toasted an
English muffin.&amp;rdquo; She made a face of disgust and said, &amp;ldquo;Eww, that&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;, English muffins are designed to be eaten toasted! They are
disgusting raw.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I disputed that there was a &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; way to eat English muffins, but
allowed her to toast the muffin halves for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting sandwich tasted pretty good. I then realized that I had
been eating English muffins wrong my entire life. How could this be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-breakfast-growing-up-in-america&#34;&gt;My breakfast growing up in America&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to understand that I spent the first couple of years of my
remembered childhood, as the first child of immigrant parents to
America, eating a breakfast that often consisted of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congee&#34;&gt;congee&lt;/a&gt; (rice porridge) with
toppings (I particularly liked pickled cucumbers and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rousong&#34;&gt;rousong&lt;/a&gt;, a dried pork product).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bread was not part of my usual diet until I went to Kindergarten in
New York City, where I ate free lunches and was introduced to such
bizarre concepts as the grilled
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese_sandwich&#34;&gt;cheese sandwich&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did increasingly eat &amp;ldquo;American&amp;rdquo; foods as I grew up, but still, I was
never introduced to the full variety of breakfast foods for a long
time. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until I was over ten years old, for example, that I
took the initiative and convinced my mother that we should try out
pancakes and waffles and cinnamon toast. Jellies, jams, syrup, butter
really came into my life then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But English muffins were somehow left out. My mother bought them but
apparently &lt;em&gt;we ate them wrong&lt;/em&gt;. We didn&amp;rsquo;t toast them. And because &lt;em&gt;they
didn&amp;rsquo;t taste so good&lt;/em&gt; to me, I never really ate them again. For the
next decades of my life, given a choice, I never took an English
muffin if I could instead eat a donut, cupcake, bagel, or ordinary
sliced bread. I had come to associate English muffins with &amp;ldquo;not
tasty&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-learned-from-my-conversion-today&#34;&gt;Lessons learned from my conversion today&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, this morning I learned that toasted English muffins are actually
pretty good. They have a particular texture, form factor, aroma,
crispness when toasted. Although I currently try to limit my intake of
bread in general, in the future if I am confronted with the usual free
hotel breakfast, I will definitely choose English muffins!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we returned home, I actually looked online to find out the
&amp;ldquo;truth&amp;rdquo; about English muffins. Well, it turns out that a lot of people
online do note that raw English muffins don&amp;rsquo;t taste so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What broader lessons have I learned?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is possible for an immigrant to live in a country for decades and
yet not fully understand what a native does, simply because of early
choices or misleading experiences in some aspect of life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just because something tastes bad in one form doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it has to
taste bad in &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; its possible forms (I am always learning this; I only
recently learned to &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2014/03/21/time-to-taste-the-world-thoughts-on-expanding-my-food-tastes-as-an-adult&#34;&gt;enjoy Brussels sprouts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although there is no such thing, objectively, as preparing or eating
something the &amp;ldquo;wrong&amp;rdquo; way, you might find some ways (including
generally accepted traditional practices) to have merit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People don&amp;rsquo;t always tell you when you&amp;rsquo;re doing something
&amp;ldquo;wrong&amp;rdquo;. Some might just be polite and remain silent. Others might
let the oddity slip because they think you are just being weird and
truly enjoy raw English muffins. Don&amp;rsquo;t make the assumption that
people are doing what they really like; they could just be operating
out of habit and not knowing or having explored an alternative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed learning that English muffins are actually edible after
all. I don&amp;rsquo;t really expect to ever eat a raw English muffin again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has anyone ever pointed out something to you that you weren&amp;rsquo;t aware
  of even though maybe you &amp;ldquo;should&amp;rdquo; have known? Did you feel
  embarrassed or argue, or did you try out the new suggestion? When
  you see someone doing something weird, do you ever step in and offer
  a suggestion, or do you prefer to be polite and not be nosy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;postscript&#34;&gt;Postscript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This evening when discussing the breakfast incident with Abby, somehow
the subject of bagels came up and she said something about toasting
bagels, and I recoiled in horror, because I was pretty sure that
&lt;em&gt;bagels are not supposed to be toasted&lt;/em&gt;. Again, I had to consult the
Internet to find out the &amp;ldquo;truth&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might expect, the truth is that I grew up with bagels living in
New York City and the East Coast in general, before moving to the
Midwest. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thedailymeal.com/real-new-yorkers-dont-toast-their-bagels&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Real New Yorkers don&amp;rsquo;t toast their bagels&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.
If you have access to a fresh, good bagel, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty wrong to toast
it, right? Well, as the article points out, there are differing
opinions, admittedly, and nobody argues that a crappy stale bagel or a
frozen one shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be toasted. Still, out of sheer habit, I have
never toasted a bagel, even if it might deserve toasting. Interesting,
huh? It&amp;rsquo;s just a habit. I see the logic of reviving a bagel as
needed. So I will consider toasting crappy bagels in the future if
they need that treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reflections on Food Day</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/10/24/reflections-on-food-day/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Oct 2012 22:38:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/10/24/reflections-on-food-day/</guid>

        &lt;h4&gt;Soup and veggies&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A year ago I celebrated &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.foodday.org/&#34;&gt;Food Day&lt;/a&gt; for the first time, by sharing &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/24/every-day-is-food-day/&#34;&gt;some reflections on what food means to me&lt;/a&gt;. Today I review my reflections and some more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;buying-food&#34;&gt;Buying food&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby and I still take care to shop carefully for groceries and make our own tasty meals to eat. Some of our sources:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://kretschmannfarm.com/&#34;&gt;Kretschmann Farm&lt;/a&gt; CSA subscription for local produce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.localharvest.org/miseras-organic-farm-M14896&#34;&gt;Misera&amp;rsquo;s Organic Farm&lt;/a&gt; for local &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/09/24/whats-a-nice-acorn-squash-like-you-doing-in-a-pot-of-spicy-lentils/&#34;&gt;chickens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lewisfamilyfarms.com/&#34;&gt;Lewis Family Farms&lt;/a&gt; for local beef&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pine-richland.patch.com/articles/stoney-lane-farm-a-little-bit-country-in-suburbia&#34;&gt;Stoney Lane Farm&lt;/a&gt; for local &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/11/28/thankful-for-the-free-range-orange-yolked-eggs/&#34;&gt;eggs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.traderjoes.com/&#34;&gt;Trader Joe&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eastendfood.coop/&#34;&gt;East End Food Co-op&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our food choices are based on our concerns for both &lt;em&gt;health&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;sustainability&lt;/em&gt;. Our choices may have an impact on one or the other or both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cooking&#34;&gt;Cooking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started my blog over a year ago, I had thought I would be posting more about cooking, since I was doing a good amount of it, but as it turned out, during this year (2012), Abby took over almost all of the cooking for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;diet&#34;&gt;Diet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Abby and I have experimented in paleo directions in the past year. As a reminder, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that we&amp;rsquo;re just going around chowing down on all the meat we can eat. It does mean that we have&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;considerably increased our consumption of vegetables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increased our consumption of various fats and oils&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reduced our consumption of carbs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-question-of-carbs&#34;&gt;The question of carbs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we seemed to discover was that we needed some base level of carbs in order to maintain energy and weight levels. Through experimentation, Abby has focused on getting carbs through potatoes and sweet potatoes primarily, going almost completely off wheat. I, on the other hand, am still hooked on rice; I also still eat some wheat, but frankly, I can tell from the effects that I would probably do best to eliminate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;rice-disaster&#34;&gt;Rice disaster?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, I wondered about brown rice, and even briefly experimented with &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/12/07/is-brown-rice-healthy-or-not/&#34;&gt;switching to white rice&lt;/a&gt;. The white rice experiment was a fast failure: the high glycemic index and lack of fiber didn&amp;rsquo;t help me at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, there have been reports of &lt;em&gt;brown rice&lt;/em&gt; in particular having &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2012/11/arsenic-in-your-food/index.htm&#34;&gt;high levels of arsenic&lt;/a&gt;. This is rather disturbing, and Abby and I have agreed that I need to quickly re-evaluate my consumption of brown rice. I&amp;rsquo;ve committed to trying out some alternative source of calories/fiber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-breakfast&#34;&gt;My breakfast&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My breakfast has remained fairly &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/01/26/improving-my-breakfast-and-other-meals/&#34;&gt;stable&lt;/a&gt; since &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/23/paleo-diet-experimentation/&#34;&gt;I quit oatmeal&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, I eat&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;veggies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eggs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nuts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a prune&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on how I feel and what&amp;rsquo;s available, occasionally I&amp;rsquo;ll eat some bacon or fish, and sometimes I&amp;rsquo;ll add some sweet potatoes or other carbs, but typically that&amp;rsquo;s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I stopped the flax seeds, largely out of inconvenience of grinding them!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what I happened to eat today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/food-day-2012-breakfast-1.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Soup and veggies&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/food-day-2012-breakfast-2.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Eggs&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The soup and veggies were leftovers from big batches Abby or I had made earlier:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my cauliflower leaf soup with garlic, carrots, sweet potatoes, curry powder, extra virgin olive oil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my stir-fried cauliflower florets with garlic, green peppers, coconut oil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abby&amp;rsquo;s spaghetti squash with onion and other stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on top of that I also ate two fried eggs with walnuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-lunch-and-dinner&#34;&gt;My lunch and dinner&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch and dinner were combinations of various leftovers, all originally made by Abby (hence my not knowing the exact ingredients):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ground beef stew with green peppers, jalapeno, onion, various seasoning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;slow-cooked chicken with veggies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;leftover kale and onion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dinner included sauteed zucchini and other veggies Abby cooked tonight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;brown rice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;fasting&#34;&gt;Fasting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I deliberately fast for a meal or two. This happens when I just don&amp;rsquo;t feel all that hungry. I treat that as a signal from my body that I don&amp;rsquo;t really need to eat. My experiments have convinced me that &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermittent_fasting&#34;&gt;intermittent fasting&lt;/a&gt; helps with fat loss and mental clarity. It also helps me remember to be grateful, when I do eat again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are human beings, not robots. We need food. And food isn&amp;rsquo;t just &amp;ldquo;fuel&amp;rdquo;. It lives or has lived. It is complex. I am grateful to be living in a land of plenty, and that Abby has taken so much care to make varied and tasty dishes for us. But as the recent reports on arsenic reminds me, there is much we must continue to do to prevent the degradation of what we eat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is brown rice healthy or not?</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/12/07/is-brown-rice-healthy-or-not/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2011 23:48:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/12/07/is-brown-rice-healthy-or-not/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking for a year or two now about my relationship with rice, in conjunction with reading about &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/23/paleo-diet-experimentation/&#34;&gt;paleo diets&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve been eating rice, white or brown, for most of my life, and am now considering make some further changes to my diet (beyond &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/11/03/one-of-these-breakfasts-is-not-paleo/&#34;&gt;giving up oatmeal&lt;/a&gt; for an entire month now).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what now with rice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;white-rice&#34;&gt;White rice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, I ate white rice often, because it was something my mother provided for most meals. Actually, it was present for me at almost all meals, until I decided I wanted to eat, all the time, the sweet breakfast cereals I saw on TV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I went off to college, I drastically changed my diet, being dependent on cafeteria food and also being tempted by opportunities to eat pizza and chicken wings and the like outside of the provided meals. I ate much less rice then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in grad school at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cmu.edu/&#34;&gt;CMU&lt;/a&gt;, I got back into eating white rice, as a result of developing the habit of eating Indian food for lunch: I would buy lunch from either the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tasteofindiapittsburgh.com/&#34;&gt;Taste of India&lt;/a&gt; present on campus or from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.srees.com/&#34;&gt;Sree&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; food truck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;brown-rice-for-five-years&#34;&gt;Brown rice for five years&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many years, I kept hearing that brown rice was healthier than white rice, and this advice was based on the idea that white rice has lost many of its nutrients and fiber during the refinement process. But I never ate brown rice because every time I tried making it, it came out unpalatable. Eventually I learned that I was making it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2006, after hearing too often from a friend that white rice was &amp;ldquo;white death&amp;rdquo;, I took the plunge and bought a fancy Zojirushi Neuro Fuzzy rice cooker, to be able to make good brown rice as well as start eating steel cut oatmeal (which my friend also advocated eating). So it&amp;rsquo;s been over five years since I have been eating a lot of oatmeal (recently stopped) and brown rice (still going). And I have to confess that if one is going to eat steel cut oatmeal or brown rice, the Neuro Fuzzy cooker is the way to go, with its timer functions that make it trivial to generate really good results!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;paleo&#34;&gt;Paleo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter the paleo movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started reading that maybe brown rice isn&amp;rsquo;t so healthy after all.  Sources such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.marksdailyapple.com/is-rice-unhealthy/&#34;&gt;Mark Sisson&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://perfecthealthdiet.com/&#34;&gt;Jaminets&lt;/a&gt; argue that brown rice is harmful because of phytic acid that binds to nutrients and makes them inaccessible to us. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how true this is. But if it is true, it is worrying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sisson suggests soaking and fermenting brown rice. Having sort of tried this, I was disgusted by the results. Stephan Guyenet suggested a whole complicated-sounding protocol for &lt;a href=&#34;http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2009/04/new-way-to-soak-brown-rice.html&#34;&gt;soaking brown rice&lt;/a&gt;. Looking at the comments gave me a headache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-now&#34;&gt;What now?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what am I to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eat brown rice in part to get fiber and in part to get (carb) calories. I have experimented with eating less brown rice lately, but am now considering doing an experiment in which I actually give it up for two weeks or so, to see how I feel. Giving up oatmeal has largely been a good thing for me; I rather enjoy eating a lot of veggies and more protein for breakfast. But getting rid of brown rice is much more radical.  Should I really go back to white rice?  I don&amp;rsquo;t know right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-of-2012-10-24&#34;&gt;(Update of 2012-10-24)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Food Day in 2012, I wrote more about some &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/10/24/reflections-on-food-day/&#34;&gt;dilemmas with rice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
