      <title>Accidentally discovering and performing some music by Brazilian composer Ernesto Nazareth: Coração que Sente</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In November, I fell in love with some music I accidentally discovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happened was that I was looking for some music for &lt;em&gt;flute&lt;/em&gt; and
&lt;em&gt;guitar&lt;/em&gt; to play, with me on flute and one of my friends on guitar, and
I did a simple search in the
&lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/09/30/free-to-the-people-since-1895/&#34;&gt;local library&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://librarycatalog.einetwork.net/&#34;&gt;online catalog&lt;/a&gt;, and at the top
sorted by date was
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.halleonard.com/product/viewproduct.action?itemid=49044167&amp;amp;&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Brazilian folk tunes for flute and guitar&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;,
which came with a CD of sample performance tracks,
so I picked it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What followed was a series of explorations that resulted in unexpected
changes in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;exploring-the-brazilian-music-in-the-score-book&#34;&gt;Exploring the Brazilian music in the score book&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I listened to some tracks on the CD of this book of arrangements and
found the music (Brazilian polkas, tangos, waltzes) really
enchanting. Most of the music was by a composer
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernesto_Nazareth&#34;&gt;Ernesto Nazareth&lt;/a&gt;,
who lived 1863-1934. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t call this music &amp;ldquo;folk tunes&amp;rdquo;: it&amp;rsquo;s
a sophisticated combination of popular and classical styles using
catchy dance rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a real sucker for waltzes, so at first I thought I would pick one
of the beautiful waltzes to choose to suggest to play with a partner
on guitar. It came down to &amp;ldquo;Confidências&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Coração que Sente&amp;rdquo;
(English translation: &amp;ldquo;Heart that Feels&amp;rdquo;). The
latter was much easier and shorter, as I learned while sight reading
through it with the CD track, so I thought I was done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;finding-astounding-performances-of-coração-que-sente-on-youtube&#34;&gt;Finding astounding performances of &amp;ldquo;Coração que Sente&amp;rdquo; on YouTube&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking for performances of the piece on YouTube to get an idea of
how people play it, I immediately entered a strange new world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, I learned that the original music was for
&lt;em&gt;piano&lt;/em&gt;. OK. Then, while listening to and/or watching a dozen or so
videos of performances of this piece (OK, I was obsessed), I found a
huge variety of interpretations, and some of them spoke to me more
than others. Some I found light and boring. The ones that interested
me were the ones that were extremely intense and probing. You might
think this music was just fluff, but I found a dark undercurrent
behind it that spoke to me, in that its different sections (the piece
is roughly in rondo form) present clear emotional contrasts, with
longing, melancholy, and manic excitement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;arthur-moreira-lima&#34;&gt;Arthur Moreira Lima&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very intense performance I found was by a pianist named
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Moreira_Lima&#34;&gt;Arthur Moreira Lima&lt;/a&gt;
in 1975, used after the fact as soundtrack on YouTube for a silent
film using footage from 1929. What an odd pairing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lima goes all out in Romantic expressiveness, with extensive rubato
and dynamic and rhythmic flexibility. It was completely different from
the relatively straight, danceable version on the flute/guitar CD
demo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to listen to his performance (ignore the film or watch it, as
you wish):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mmjt8RrfXtA&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;joão-carlos-assis-brasil&#34;&gt;João Carlos Assis Brasil&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more extreme than Lima was this weird guy João Carlos Assis
Brasil, who is apparently so unknown in the English-speaking world
that Wikipedia doesn&amp;rsquo;t have an entry on him, although I found this
random
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Bio/Assis-Brasil-Joao-Carlos.htm&#34;&gt;pieced-together bio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His live performance here from 2013 is the single most extreme, yet
deepest, interpretation of this waltz I found (he adds his own
ornamentation). I was deeply moved by it. (Warning, bad sound
quality.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/iG_o94sU1tE&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-good-performances&#34;&gt;Other good performances&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernanda_Chaves_Canaud&#34;&gt;Fernanda Canaud&lt;/a&gt;,
with a very expressive performance (including her own extensive
embellishments), uses drastic changes in articulation and tempo for
contrast. I particularly liked how naturally she seemed to express her
personality through the piece:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-DfOYvNCaqk&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Teresa_Madeira&#34;&gt;Maria Theresa Madeira&lt;/a&gt;
captures well the moods of the different sections of the piece; I
really like the rhythmic alertness and drive throughout:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/eeztzLsF6Cc&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some random YouTube guy named Ilton, playing a really crappy upright
piano, but with amazing rhythmic expression that I totally love (if he
played this on a good piano, I would consider his interpretation one
of my favorites, period):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/b-gYk_YUoIM&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://lucianoalves.com.br/&#34;&gt;Luciano Alves&lt;/a&gt;, 2013, in an elegant
performance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/y8LchR8Mi5Y&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_Bratke&#34;&gt;Marcelo Bratke&lt;/a&gt; in a
relaxed, easygoing, dream interpretation with a lilt (but after all
the intense interpretations, I find this tame, I confess):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pn5vYhfQYHs&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-performance-that-made-me-decide-to-learn-and-play-the-piece&#34;&gt;The performance that made me decide to learn and play the piece&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I spent a lot of time listening to and watching performances of the
piece, but one performance was the one that made me decide to go learn
and play the piece! It was this one by some random guy Marcelo Chiarella:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/QaQL9VlJy8s&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Because I could &lt;em&gt;relate to&lt;/em&gt; his playing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He wasn&amp;rsquo;t some famous pro pianist, as far as I could tell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sound quality was good and the recording was as though I were
standing right there, made me feel like I was in his home, and
nobody else there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I could see his hands up close.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I liked various things he did with expression (especially when he
&lt;em&gt;wasn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; pedaling).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I knew that I could be much more expressive and personal
(remember, the title in English translation is &amp;ldquo;Heart that feels&amp;rdquo;)
while playing this piece &lt;em&gt;solo&lt;/em&gt;, on piano, than in a flute/guitar
duet. So I decided to go for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;finding-an-official-free-score&#34;&gt;Finding an official free score&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to find a score. Luckily, it turned out that there was some
big
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ernestonazareth150anos.com.br/&#34;&gt;150-year anniversary celebration for Ernesto Nazareth&lt;/a&gt;
in 2013, and I found an official &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ernestonazareth150anos.com.br/files/uploads/work_elements/work_43/coracao_que_sente_piano.pdf&#34;&gt;free PDF score&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ernestonazareth150anos.com.br/works/view/43&#34;&gt;page for the piece&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That page also had a story about the title of the piece and why it was
composed. It was in Portuguese, so I tried with the help of Google
Translate to translate it (I only studied Portuguese for several weeks
many years ago), and pieced together (I hope I didn&amp;rsquo;t get this too
wrong) that Nazareth dedicated it to a student of his, Gabriella
Crauz, who had showed great emotion as Nazareth described the last
days of a dying nephew, as though she had been there herself
experiencing what he experienced as he saw the sights in the city one
last time. (If you know Portuguese, please correct me if I got the
story wrong.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This story only added to the sense I already had that this seemingly
simple piece hid a depth of emotion that some performers already
revealed for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-performance-of-coração-que-sente&#34;&gt;My performance of &amp;ldquo;Coração que Sente&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I started working on the piece, I had to decide where and when to
perform it. It turned out that I learned that friends who mean a lot
to me decided to move. This was really tough news to me, and they have
always invited me and Abby to their December holiday party, where I
play music, so I decided that I was going to perform the piece at
their (now farewell) party and openly dedicate my performance to them,
because they are human beings of deep feeling, hence &amp;ldquo;Heart that
feels&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I performed the piece at the party the day after Christmas. In my
nervousness, I completely lost my train of thought a couple of times
and botched things up inexplicably (I had gone through the piece with
no errors so many times at home), but I made it through, and my
gesture was appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then decided to quickly record myself at home soon after (and still
botched some things up), so here I am. This is for Henry and Gina:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34;
src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/VBOS9btMUPI&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;
allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-music-by-ernesto-nazareth&#34;&gt;Other music by Ernesto Nazareth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent all this time talking about just one piece by Nazareth, but he
wrote much more, and more substantial pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I totally love Fernanda Canaud&amp;rsquo;s performance of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ernestonazareth150anos.com.br/works/view/133&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Batuque&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;Coração
que Sente&amp;rdquo;, and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ernestonazareth150anos.com.br/works/view/136&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Odeon&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;
(the performance of &amp;ldquo;Coração que Sente&amp;rdquo; is very different from the one
I posted above: more inward, refined, beautiful rather than super-dramatic):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/U6WaAgRWqaw&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is Nazareth playing his own pieces in recordings from 1912-1930:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/eZS3bDNJEUY&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a one-hour special documentary video &amp;ldquo;Nazareth Revisitado&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/TJAT3pJJR6M&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-note-on-the-english-language-oriented-web&#34;&gt;A note on the English-language-oriented Web&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found a whole world of music and musicians that barely register in
the English-language-oriented part of the Web. Most of what I found
when trying to look up Nazareth or various Brazilian pianists was in
Portuguese. So it&amp;rsquo;s been really humbling to remember that many in the
English-speaking world might not even know about all these Brazilian
composers and musicians who are not big enough stars to warrant
international fame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am grateful for accidentally discovering an entire world of
Brazilian music and performers of it through my search in the local
library catalog for music to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am grateful for friends who inspire me by their examples as human
beings of genuine and great feeling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Thoughts on Cuba while watching Cuban musicians performing the 1947 bolero &#34;La gloria eres tú&#34;</title>

      <pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2014 21:01:47 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2014/12/13/thoughts-on-cuba-while-watching-cuban-musicians-performing-the-1947-bolero-la-gloria-eres-tu/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to be thinking so much about Cuba today. It all started with a random musical itch I was scratching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;la-comparsa-and-the-wooden-flute-headjoint&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;La comparsa&amp;rdquo; and the wooden flute headjoint&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I was in a Latin music mood as I was playing my flute at home, and started looking up flute versions of music on YouTube for fun and inspiration. One piece that came to mind was the famous &amp;ldquo;La comparsa&amp;rdquo;, by Cuban composer &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernesto_Lecuona&#34;&gt;Ernesto Lecuona&lt;/a&gt;. Last year when Bebo Valdés died, I wrote about being moved by the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/03/22/rip-bebo-valdes/&#34;&gt;reunion of Bebo with his son Chucho in a tearful duet performance of this piece on two pianos&lt;/a&gt;, and thinking about their separation as Bebo abandoned his family to flee Cuba for Sweden while his son stayed behind to become one of Cuba&amp;rsquo;s great musicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found a really quirky Latin jazz performance of &amp;ldquo;La comparsa&amp;rdquo; on YouTube by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chipboaz.com/blog/2014/07/10/cuban-flautist-bobby-ramirez-releases-jazz-flute/&#34;&gt;Cuban-American&lt;/a&gt; jazz flutist &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bobbyramirez.com/&#34;&gt;Bobby Ramirez&lt;/a&gt; and Puerto Rican &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.negronistrio.com/&#34;&gt;Jose Negroni&lt;/a&gt; on keyboard:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/4Nro7myJ6Nw&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ramirez on flute was unfortunately out of tune with the keyboard, but what I noticed was his wooden headjoint. I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen the old traditional Cuban wooden &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.descarga.com/cgi-bin/db/archives/Article15&#34;&gt;Charanga flute&lt;/a&gt;, but do see flutists playing the modern Boehm flute with a wooden headjoint for a different sound. In fact, I love and prefer wooden flutes, but they are expensive and I own only one, a &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/07/30/got-my-new-casey-burns-small-handed-irish-flute/&#34;&gt;Casey Burns Irish flute&lt;/a&gt;. So just for the fun of it (I can&amp;rsquo;t really justify the investment right now), I decided to search the Web for makers of wooden headjoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;juan-novo-wooden-flute-headjoints&#34;&gt;Juan Novo wooden flute headjoints&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the top Web hits was &lt;a href=&#34;http://jnovoheadjoints.com/&#34;&gt;Juan Novo&lt;/a&gt;. It had the benefit of having an embedded YouTube video with the caption &amp;ldquo;This musician appreciated Mr. Novo’s craftsmanship so much, that this song was dedicated to him.&amp;rdquo; So I checked out the video. Indeed, the young woman playing the flute said, &amp;ldquo;Está para Juan Novo&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/kBzrwhpVvDE&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, I noticed that Juan Novo&amp;rsquo;s biography said he was sent from Cuba to the US all alone by his parents in 1962 to &lt;a href=&#34;http://jnovoheadjoints.com/about-juan-novo/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;escape the rampant communist indoctrination&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;la-gloria-eres-tú&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;La gloria eres tú&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was captivated not so much by the flute playing, but by the beautiful singing, of the young woman in this video of the classic bolero &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cancioneros.com/nc/2806/0/la-gloria-eres-tu-jose-antonio-mendez&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;La gloria eres tú&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; written by Cuban composer &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.encaribe.org/es/article/jose-antonio-mendez-garcia/1296&#34;&gt;José Antonio Méndez&lt;/a&gt; in 1947. I was really touched by her clear, unexaggerated but free expression and style, especially in light of much more famous performances of the song in my memory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;La gloria eres tú&amp;rdquo; is one of my favorite boleros (&lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/08/10/rip-eydie/&#34;&gt;my favorite being &amp;ldquo;Sabor a mî&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;) of all time. For comparison:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;luis-miguel&#34;&gt;Luis Miguel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first exposure to &amp;ldquo;La gloria eres tú&amp;rdquo; was, like probably many others of my generation or younger worlwide, through the revival of the bolero by Mexican pop star &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Miguel&#34;&gt;Luis Miguel&lt;/a&gt; in the 1990s and onwards. I have all his bolero albums, a result of taking up Latin ballroom dancing in 2000 and hearing him singing in much of the music we practiced, performed, and competed to, including my first discovery of &amp;ldquo;Sabor a mî&amp;rdquo;, which was also on the 1997 album &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romances_%28Luis_Miguel_album%29&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Romances&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. Luis Miguel is a great musician, I will continue to admit, but in time I drew away from his high-powered, slick performances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here he is live, from his 2000 DVD &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivo_%28Luis_Miguel_album%29&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Vivo&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, which was the last thing I bought by him before backing away from his work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/GNldCVbD4b4&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;olga-guillot&#34;&gt;Olga Guillot&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the gold standard for &amp;ldquo;La gloria eres tú&amp;rdquo; is the performance by Cuban &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olga_Guillot&#34;&gt;Olga Guillot&lt;/a&gt;, the &amp;ldquo;queen of the bolero&amp;rdquo;. (In 1961, she was yet another musician who fled Cuba.) I like how she alternates between different moods, starting out gently and almost like a prayer, but then gets more and more passionate. She very quickly changes the color of her voice and dynamics. For me it&amp;rsquo;s still the greatest performance of this bolero:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/xEAOX2nxsEo&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;elena-burke&#34;&gt;Elena Burke&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another recording I have of the bolero is from an album by Cuban singer &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Burke&#34;&gt;Elena Burke&lt;/a&gt;. She has her own style, with a low voice, and more staccato delivery:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elena died in Havana in 2002. Her daughter &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malena_Burke&#34;&gt;Malena&lt;/a&gt; came to Miami in the US in 1995 with her family. Here is Malena Burke performing the bolero with Arturo Sandoval on piano:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malena Burke&amp;rsquo;s oldest daughter &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lena_Burke&#34;&gt;Lena&lt;/a&gt; is also a musician, a pianist and singer, and has worked with Gloria Estefan and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s Lena singing the famous 1929 bolero-son &lt;a href=&#34;http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1grimas_negras&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Lágrimas negras&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; with Bebo Valdés and others. This is such a weird combo, with her being sixty years younger than Bebo and stylistically very &amp;ldquo;American pop&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/x56VtBF6iGo&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;arturo-sandoval&#34;&gt;Arturo Sandoval&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arturo_Sandoval&#34;&gt;Arturo Sandoval&lt;/a&gt;, he defected from Cuba to the US in 2000. I discovered him initially when his biographical film &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Love_or_Country:_The_Arturo_Sandoval_Story&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;For Love or Country&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; about his life before defection came out, and I saw him perform in the Three Rivers Arts Festival in Pittsburgh in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a Latin jazz version by Arturo Sandoval on flugelhorn, from his 1994 album &amp;ldquo;Tenderly&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/AZW15092fx4&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;where-is-blau-colonial-cayo-coco&#34;&gt;Where is Blau Colonial Cayo Coco?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there were many thoughts and questions already in my mind as a result of listening to this old Cuban bolero, as a result of my remembering past performances by musicians who had left Cuba. When I hear classic boleros, I think about old Cuba, the culture and society that produced this kind of music and musicians, the political upheaval, the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But back to that little band Nucay, captured presumably on a phone outside on a windy day by a random tourist who posted the video on YouTube in 2010. What has life been like for the members of Nucay, and for the charming young flutist/singer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, what and where is &amp;ldquo;Blau Colonial Cayo Coco&amp;rdquo;? Apparently it&amp;rsquo;s a resort now named just &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cayocococuba.net/hotel_colonialcayococo.html&#34;&gt;Colonial Cayo Coco&lt;/a&gt; on the island of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayo_Coco&#34;&gt;Cayo Coco&lt;/a&gt; that is part of Cuba. In particular, this place was designed to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cubahotelreservation.com/hotel.asp?hotel_code=sctblacolonial&#34;&gt;look like a village&lt;/a&gt;. This kind of thing makes me uncomfortable. I guess tourists fly in to pretend to have a nice &amp;ldquo;village&amp;rdquo; experience, while the hired musicians are probably paid to look and act the part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;nucay&#34;&gt;Nucay&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked up more performances on YouTube by this band Nucay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;oye-como-va-cha-cha&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oye como va&amp;rdquo;, cha-cha&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The caption for this video reads, &amp;ldquo;Ramon Almeida and daughter Arleytis [sic] lead this wonderful group of talented Cuban musicians.&amp;rdquo; So now we have some names. I presume the leader with maracas is the father? (Later I determined his daughter&amp;rsquo;s name is actually &amp;ldquo;Arletis&amp;rdquo;: read on.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a fine performance of the classic cha-cha &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oye_Como_Va&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oye coma va&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; written by &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tito_Puente&#34;&gt;Tito Puente&lt;/a&gt; in 1963. No, Puente was not Cuban; he was born in New York and was a big force in creating the mambo/salsa scene in the US in the 1950s. A great Latin jazz musician. I should have gone to see him perform live when he was in Pittsburgh in 2000 before he died. His music was great for listening to as well as dancing to; I still remember practicing my dancing to the first album of his I bought, &amp;ldquo;Mambo Birdland&amp;rdquo; (which has an &amp;ldquo;Oye como va&amp;rdquo; track).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;rsquo;ll confess that hearing performances of this work over a decade ago inspired me to think about taking up flute again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arletis did a fine job on flute here, jazzing things up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/l4uWBPD7y70&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ay-maria-merengue&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ay Maria!&amp;rdquo;, merengue&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The musicians seem to be having fun; how could one not, given the catchy music and all of them singing? I really enjoyed flute action by Arletis in this upbeat classic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merengue_music&#34;&gt;merengue&lt;/a&gt; is not Cuban, but comes from the Dominican Republic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/tAgVVL_ZTmI&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;sabor-a-mî&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sabor a mî&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite bolero, performed well. The caption reads &amp;ldquo;Cuban Music with the help of young percussionist from Quebec&amp;rdquo;, but this is wrong: &lt;a href=&#34;http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabor_a_m%C3%AD_%28canci%C3%B3n%29&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sabor a mî&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; was composed in 1959 by a Mexican composer, &lt;a href=&#34;http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81lvaro_Carrillo&#34;&gt;Álvaro Carrillo&lt;/a&gt;. These distinctions matter to me: &amp;ldquo;Latin&amp;rdquo; music is not all the same, any more than the people or the distinct cultures are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/RmOIKdY3LYw&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;some-salsa-song&#34;&gt;Some salsa song&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is some salsa song; I&amp;rsquo;m afraid I cannot identify it offhand, the way I did the other songs. I&amp;rsquo;d have to try to transcribe the lyrics and hope that a Web search finds something, but have my doubts when it comes to salsa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved the father-daughter musical interplay here, with Ramón singing and Arletis on flute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/sAMdEezxYJs&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary-of-nucay&#34;&gt;Summary of Nucay&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, so Nucay is a pretty good band and plays a lot of classics to please the tourists. What else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;arletis-almeida-sentirse-asi&#34;&gt;Arletis Almeida, &amp;ldquo;Sentirse Asi&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that a search for more Nucay material on YouTube reveals the following slick, professionally produced video uploaded by someone in 2012, promoting Arletis Almeida as a singer, with the caption &amp;ldquo;Arletis Almeida, flutist of Grupo Nucay in Cayo Coco Cuba, with her original song Sentirse Asi written by her father and band member Ramon Almeida&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, she is almost unrecognizable to me, very much made up and glamorous and placed in an urban nightlife setting, with shots of handsome men, alcohol, cigarettes. The contrast between this angsty, sensualized persona and the cheerful flutist playing at Colonial Cayo Coco with her father was quite jarring to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The singing is beautiful, and the song actually breaks out into a standard bolero accompaniment. It&amp;rsquo;s really something hearing bolero singing of this quality from a young person today. My overall feeling when hearing either this newly composed bolero or the classic music in the earlier videos is this: there&amp;rsquo;s some kind of time bubble that can still happen in the world, for better or for worse (a subject bigger than this blog post), and Nucay and Arletis Almeida illustrate it. Here in the US, no young people sing in this way. The many influences from pop, hip hop, and much more result in much more &amp;ldquo;fusion&amp;rdquo;. You saw that above in Lena Burke&amp;rsquo;s singing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/P1PZhDtCmLM&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;thoughts-on-cuba&#34;&gt;Thoughts on Cuba&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After watching this video, I wonder what has become of Arletis Almeida. Does she still play flute? Has she embarked on some kind of lounge career? Who knows? She&amp;rsquo;s in Cuba. Cuba is a world away. It took tourists to make her name even register on the Web, through the links to the YouTube videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve waited for decades for an end to the senseless &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_embargo_against_Cuba&#34;&gt;embargo of Cuba&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve already run out of space here to even begin talking about the politics of the Cold War, about the human cost of isolating Cuba. Cuba, a place with a complicated history, but once an advanced nation by any standard, filled with culture, music classical and popular, home of world chess champion &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Ra%C3%BAl_Capablanca&#34;&gt;Capablanca&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;con-los-años-que-me-quedan-and-nostalgia&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Con los años que me quedan&amp;rdquo; and nostalgia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason, I was reminded of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Estefan&#34;&gt;Gloria Estefan&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s music video of the bolero &amp;ldquo;Con los años que me quedan&amp;rdquo; from her nostalgic 1993 album &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mi_Tierra&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mi Tierra&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s an odd kind of nostalgia, given that her parents fled Cuba when she was young. She made this album to embrace her Cuban heritage. But what world is portrayed here? Something like the world the tourists at Cayo Cayo hope to see? And what is Arletis trying to do as she sings boleros today?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it&amp;rsquo;s definitely a beautiful song, and Estefan sings it soulfully:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/l6LjNOYvhMk&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-of-2014-12-17&#34;&gt;(Update of 2014-12-17)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Totally by coincidence, news has come of the apparent &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/world/americas/us-cuba-relations.html&#34;&gt;plan by President Obama to normalize relations with Cuba&lt;/a&gt; after half a century. I cannot process this news right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life for Arletis and her father may well change one day in interesting ways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My third year of celebrating Johann Sebastian Bach&#39;s birthday: who was this guy anyway?</title>

      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2014/03/31/my-third-year-of-celebrating-johann-sebastian-bachs-birthday-who-was-this-guy-anyway/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my third year of celebrating the birthday of Johann Sebastian Bach. I did this &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/03/21/flute-update-celebrating-bachs-birthday/&#34;&gt;in 2012&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/03/21/my-second-year-of-celebrating-johann-sebastian-bachs-birthday/&#34;&gt;in 2013&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first year, I consciously chose to play some of his music rather than read about it (or about his life). The second year, I played some more of his music, on flute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, I did something different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, I learned that I had gotten his birthday &amp;ldquo;wrong&amp;rdquo; in the past two years! This year I decided to celebrate the actual birthday (in terms of passing of time) rather than his birth date (which was March 21 according to the old Julian calendar). A minor detail, but symbolic of my intention.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/bach-gardiner.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Bobblehead and Gardiner&amp;#39;s book about J S Bach&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This photo is of &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/09/20/my-first-bobblehead-doll-guess-who/&#34;&gt;my Bach bobblehead&lt;/a&gt; next to a new book about Bach by John Eliot Gardiner that I just got out of the Carnegie Library today; I had decided that for this year, I would learn more about Bach, the man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-brand-new-book-about-johann-sebastian-bach&#34;&gt;A brand new book about Johann Sebastian Bach&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago, I came across an interview &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/2013/10/25/240780499/bach-unwigged-the-man-behind-the-music&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Bach unwigged: the man behind the music&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Eliot_Gardiner&#34;&gt;John Eliot Gardiner&lt;/a&gt;, who had finally come out with his long-awaited book about Johann Sebastian Bach, &amp;ldquo;Bach: Music in the Castle of Heaven&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Gardiner has been one of my favorite conductors for a quarter of a century; some of the very first CDs I bought in the late 1980s and early 1990s were of his recordings of Mozart&amp;rsquo;s music with the English Baroque Soloists; I still have them.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that Gardiner tried to get inside the mind of Bach, through his music as well as texts, exploring the possible contradictions within them, and what that might mean about Bach&amp;rsquo;s inner thoughts and feelings about things. Obviously, this is a somewhat subjective exercise, but definitely an intriguing one. Also, Gardiner examined facts about Bach&amp;rsquo;s actual life, including arguments and disputes with authorities, and his basically crazy busy existence in all his professional and personal roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I saw that interview transcript, I was a little curious, but not enough to rush out and get the book. But then I kept on seeing links to reviews of the book, and most recently, last month, after reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/feb/20/why-bach-moves-us/&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, I thought, hmm, maybe sensationalist, but maybe worth checking out: Bach as &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;reformed teenage thug&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put the book on hold at the Carnegie Library and picked it up today. I haven&amp;rsquo;t started reading it yet, but&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;bach-a-passionate-life-a-bbc-documentary-free-to-watch-online&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Bach: A Passionate Life&amp;rdquo;, a BBC documentary (free to watch online)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with a &amp;ldquo;shortcut&amp;rdquo; to the book: I found a documentary online that Gardiner was involved in. It&amp;rsquo;s still quite long (an hour and a half), but at least you get to see scenery, see musical excerpts being performed, and it&amp;rsquo;s not a 600-page book!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/SOO8IC8_VaY&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;playing-his-music&#34;&gt;Playing his music&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I had to play some of his music to celebrate also. I pulled out my flute and ran some of his flute sonatas&amp;rsquo; movements along with keyboard backing tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-favorite-musical-selection-to-end-the-day-chaconne-from-partita-for-violin-no-2-http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-partita-for-violin-no-2-28bach-29&#34;&gt;A favorite musical selection to end the day: &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partita_for_Violin_No._2_%28Bach%29&#34;&gt;Chaconne from partita for violin no. 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe one day I&amp;rsquo;ll write more about Bach&amp;rsquo;s Chaconne, but for today all I will say is, this is my favorite music of all time of any kind, and what I would hope to leave this world with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here is my favorite performance, by the wonderful violinist &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gidon_Kremer&#34;&gt;Gidon Kremer&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s way intense:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/DBJPVnJ8m-Y&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m generally more interested in the artistic output of people rather than their life stories, but thanks to the positive and somewhat sensationalist coverage of Gardiner&amp;rsquo;s new book, I took the bait!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Life: cooking, eating with friends, music jamming, dancing</title>

      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2014/03/29/life-cooking-eating-with-friends-music-jamming-dancing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abby and I went to a French potluck dance party at Lisa&amp;rsquo;s, the first one we&amp;rsquo;ve attended together in &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/05/25/learning-the-congo-de-captieux-traditional-french-dance/&#34;&gt;ten months&lt;/a&gt; (although I went to one without Abby &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/09/14/back-to-french-dance-potluck-and-party/&#34;&gt;half a year ago&lt;/a&gt; when she was out of town).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a wonderful experience, one that we&amp;rsquo;ve missed for two months, since we have not gone out to a party with friends since Abby got a new job and we&amp;rsquo;ve had to adapt to that big change in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we still had to leave early, I was reminded of what I really enjoy in life, deep down: nothing fancy, just getting together and having fun and being creative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;music-jamming&#34;&gt;Music jamming&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hadn&amp;rsquo;t done French music jamming in months, so when Abby and I arrived, and dinner was still being prepared, and John said &amp;ldquo;hey, let&amp;rsquo;s play&amp;rdquo;, I pulled out my flutes (both my standard Boehm flute and my wooden Irish flute) and went at it with him on melodeon. We hadn&amp;rsquo;t played together in half a year! Susan joined in at some point, also on melodeon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We played mazurka and Schottische and other music for about half an hour, from John&amp;rsquo;s memory, as I tried to follow along by ear. I realized how much I miss French music jamming. Lisa&amp;rsquo;s been hosting it again recently, but there have been schedule conflicts for me, but it looks like we&amp;rsquo;ll be getting on a schedule that works for me. I&amp;rsquo;m coming back!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was taking a break, John played a multi-section hanter dro that Fabien and Lisa started dancing to, and I joined them in their line and picked it up. Again, something I hadn&amp;rsquo;t done in a while, and almost forgotten the unique pleasure of!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;potluck&#34;&gt;Potluck&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seemed to me the biggest French potluck party yet, with almost twenty people present, I believe. We met some new people as well as old friends.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/french-potluck-2014-03-29/dinner.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;At dinner&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I baked a butternut squash to bring. I only very, very lightly seasoned it, to not detract from the natural flavor of the squash:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;butternut squash, sliced in half, placed in roasting pan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pepper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cayenne pepper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;butter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extra virgin olive oil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;brown sugar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/french-potluck-2014-03-29/squash.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Butternut squash&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Abby made a kale and mushroom dish:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other guests all brought a lot of great homemade food, and Lisa and Alex provided tasty and filling entrees and desserts. A fantastic meal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, there were &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2014/03/21/time-to-taste-the-world-thoughts-on-expanding-my-food-tastes-as-an-adult/&#34;&gt;Brussels sprouts, and I enjoyed them&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;cookies-and-other-desserts&#34;&gt;Cookies (and other desserts)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In accordance with &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2014/01/16/a-system-for-quitting-eating-cookies/&#34;&gt;my rule&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Music-themed cookies homemade from molds:

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ate one, of a dancing couple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A slice of yummy chocolatey thing:

        &lt;h4&gt;Chocolatey&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A slice of chocolate cake:

        &lt;h4&gt;Chocolate cake&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Unfortunately, I think I should have cut myself a smaller slice, instead of accepting a precut slice.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tiny piece of a very rich, buttery thing:

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A non-homemade cookie from a box (I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to eat this):

        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/french-potluck-2014-03-29/box-cookie.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dancing&#34;&gt;Dancing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dinner, Lisa and Fabien started off the dancing portion of the evening, by re-teaching the &amp;ldquo;Congo de Captieux&amp;rdquo; set dance that Lisa and Lynn had taught &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/05/25/learning-the-congo-de-captieux-traditional-french-dance/&#34;&gt;ten months ago&lt;/a&gt;. It had been so long that Abby and I barely remembered it and were practically learning it from scratch again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of eventually got through it! I got sweaty again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, there was a break, and since it was already &amp;ldquo;late&amp;rdquo; (for Abby and me on our current schedule), we had to say goodbye, just as the &amp;ldquo;regular&amp;rdquo; French dance portion of the evening was about to begin (bourrées, waltzes, mazurkas, hanter dro, more music jamming, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some photos of dancing that I took before we left early:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/french-potluck-2014-03-29/dancing1.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/french-potluck-2014-03-29/dancing2.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/french-potluck-2014-03-29/dancing3.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a beautiful evening that filled my belly and soul. It&amp;rsquo;s been such a blessing to have been brought into this world of French traditional dance and music through the enthusiasm and generosity of Lisa &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/01/23/discovering-french-traditional-dance-in-pittsburgh/&#34;&gt;two years ago&lt;/a&gt; and many others. I feel like my life has been immeasurably enriched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re in the Pittsburgh area and want to join in, we always welcome more dancers and musicians. (Or even if you&amp;rsquo;re not in the Pittsburgh area, as we&amp;rsquo;ve had visitors from further away.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Happy 300th birthday, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach: still underappreciated after all these years!</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2014/03/08/happy-300th-birthday-carl-philipp-emanuel-bach/</link>

      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2014/03/08/happy-300th-birthday-carl-philipp-emanuel-bach/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;So, today is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/2014/03/08/267603200/a-kid-named-carl-stirs-up-the-bach-musical-dynasty&#34;&gt;300th birthday&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Philipp_Emanuel_Bach&#34;&gt;CPE Bach&lt;/a&gt;, one of the sons of the much more famous Johann Sebastian Bach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you&amp;rsquo;re a Western art music history buff, or are specifically interested in the Baroque and Classical eras, you may not even have heard of CPE Bach, which is somewhat ironic because he was actually more well-known and respected in his day than his father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this composer so little recognized today? What is fascinating is that he so much influenced other composers who respected him, such as Mozart and Beethoven, but himself has kind of faded in public awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is such a huge difference between Johann Sebastian Bach&amp;rsquo;s music, which is so well-known now, and that of his son Carl Philipp Emanuel. The son&amp;rsquo;s music was &lt;em&gt;radical&lt;/em&gt; at the time, going completely against his father&amp;rsquo;s style. He privileged bizarreness, extremes of emotion, restlessness. You get the feeling that it was experimental, and it still feels that way today. I think that history does not know what to do with someone whose life work was so relentlessly experimental.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sonata-in-a-minor-for-solo-flute&#34;&gt;Sonata in A minor for solo flute&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To celebrate CPE Bach&amp;rsquo;s birthday, I made another attempt at reading through his sonata in A minor for solo flute, the second movement of which &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/07/28/my-first-appearance-on-a-music-recital-program/&#34;&gt;I performed almost two years ago at a party&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, I was uncomfortable with how to interpret the first, slow movement, not knowing what to do with this very free music, but now, I feel liberated and happy to play this first movement, the way that I &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; it in the moment. I&amp;rsquo;d like to think that CPE Bach would have approved the evolution of my emotional openness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also rewatched a fine video performance of the final Allegro movement of this sonata, by Emmanuel Pahud:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/SeGcyPu-hNY&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no clip to share of the first movement because I don&amp;rsquo;t like any of the performances I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to find online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-i-originally-discovered-cpe-bach-freie-fantasie-in-f-sharp-minor&#34;&gt;How I originally discovered CPE Bach: Freie Fantasie in F-sharp minor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to confess how I originally discovered CPE Bach in the first place. It happened in college, when I would regularly browse the &amp;ldquo;new recordings&amp;rdquo; section of one of the campus libraries. One day I spotted on the shelf a CD by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.andreas-staier.de/&#34;&gt;Andreas Staier&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.allmusic.com/album/cpe-bach-sonatas-fantasies-mw0001969795&#34;&gt;selected CPE Bach sonatas and fantasies&lt;/a&gt;. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know the first thing about CPE Bach at that point, other than that he was a son of Johann Sebastian. But I noticed that the CD advertised that not only a harpsichord, but also a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortepiano&#34;&gt;fortepiano&lt;/a&gt; was used in the recording. I wanted to hear some fortepiano playing, so I checked out the CD. Up till then, I had only seen and heard the fortepiano once before, played by my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.workspacestrategies.com/bio.html&#34;&gt;music TA&lt;/a&gt; during a section meeting of a music appreciation course I took freshman year, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/11/09/taking-up-flute-again-after-decades/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Piano Music of the 19th Century&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, when she played sections of a Brahms intermezzo on the instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out the fortepiano was used for a particular piece on the album that caught my fancy, the Freie Fantasie (free fantasy) in F-sharp minor, which he himself titled &amp;ldquo;CPE Bachs Empfindungen&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;CPE Bach&amp;rsquo;s feelings&amp;rdquo;. As you might expect, this is a really personal, expressive piece, and I still remember finding it bewildering and bewitching in its strange harmonic changes and emotional gestures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the miracle of YouTube, you can actually listen to the exact recording that I first discovered a quarter of century ago by Andreas Staier, right here. I&amp;rsquo;ve set it to start playing at the beginning of this piece, since the entire video is actually the whole album (which is quite worth listening to, because of the brilliant harpsichord playing of the other pieces). The piece lasts from 38:35 to 49:15, just over ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/Yy9MfX1mQs0?t=38m35s&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have heard other performances of this piece but I still think Staier&amp;rsquo;s is the best, in his really getting into the improvisational and free spirit of the fantasy. By the way, I recommend Staier&amp;rsquo;s recordings of all kinds of keyboard works before and after CPE Bach: I love everything I have heard from him, from Johann Sebastian Bach to Schubert. For example, here he is live, playing Schubert on a fortepiano. Check out the fantastical outburst that is part of this sonata movement (starting around 3:04).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/TE4RNdwrWxM&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t explored the music of CPE Bach, please take advantage of the &amp;ldquo;publicity&amp;rdquo; of his 300th birthday to check out some of his work. It still sounds daring and bold today.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My first time at an English country dance music jam</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2014/01/25/my-first-time-at-english-country-dance-music-jam/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2014 19:39:03 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2014/01/25/my-first-time-at-english-country-dance-music-jam/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Relatively recently, a new English country dance music jam in the Pittsburgh area has been organized by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amarillismusic.com/aboutus.html&#34;&gt;Maro Avakian&lt;/a&gt;, whom I first met through joining in playing for the Holiday Ball &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/12/16/playing-recorder-and-flute-at-the-holiday-ball/&#34;&gt;two years ago&lt;/a&gt;. I was unable to make it to the first couple of meetings, but finally, on a nasty snowy Saturday, my schedule happened to be open, so I went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not completely new to English country dance music. It was almost two years ago when I first encountered it, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/03/31/my-first-sampling-of-english-country-dance-and-contra-dance/&#34;&gt;as a dancer&lt;/a&gt;. As has happened several times now in my life, becoming familiar with the dance got me interested in the &lt;em&gt;music&lt;/em&gt; and in the idea of actually playing the music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that I&amp;rsquo;d already played some of this kind of music for myself as a result of my study of the Baroque flute, because method books I have for the instrument include a good amount of dance music from the era. In any case, the book we use for many tunes is the volume by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.canispublishing.com/&#34;&gt;Peter Barnes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://mysite.verizon.net/peterabarnes/books.htm&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Barnes Book of English Country Dance Tunes&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, a fine anthology. Actually, I ordered my copy only last week and was lucky it arrived in the mail just in time!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://mysite.verizon.net/peterabarnes/Book1.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;instruments&#34;&gt;Instruments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a pretty good turnout given the weather. Apart from Maro on piano, we had people playing flute, Baroque flute, recorders, ukulele, mandolin, percussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d brought my flute, Baroque flute, and soprano, alto, tenor recorders, but since there were already two others on modern flute and soprano recorder, I ended up playing just the Baroque flute, alto recorder, and tenor recorder. The Baroque flute is pretty hard to play in some of the keys, and also is kind of soft, so I mostly played the alto and tenor recorders. I gradually gravitated toward improvising inner voices with the tenor recorder. I think I will do that in the future also. In addition, I should bring my bass recorder, to add a yet lower instrument to our group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;improvisation&#34;&gt;Improvisation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had great discussions about tips and tricks for improvising lines and filling out chords. Needless to say, I was botching up a lot of stuff as I experimented, but you can&amp;rsquo;t learn if you don&amp;rsquo;t try!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like I have a new musical outlet, English country dance music. I hope to continue participating in it. As with French traditional dance music, I like the improvisational nature of working with a tune with repetition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chamber music concert at CMU featured Bach&#39;s Goldberg Variations arranged for string trio</title>

        &lt;h4&gt;David Harding, Noah Bendix-Balgley, Lorna McGhee, Amit Peled&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I attended a special &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2013/november/nov8_chambermusic.html&#34;&gt;chamber music concert at CMU&lt;/a&gt; that featured some truly excellent musicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-musicians&#34;&gt;The musicians&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was particularly interested in seeing &lt;a href=&#34;http://trioverlaine.com/bios/lorna-mcghee/&#34;&gt;Lorna McGhee&lt;/a&gt;, the current principal flute of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, and violinist &lt;a href=&#34;http://noahbendixbalgley.com/&#34;&gt;Noah Bendix-Balgley&lt;/a&gt;, the concertmaster, both of whom are relatively recent additions to the orchestra. The other two musicians, also fantastic, were violist and CMU professor &lt;a href=&#34;http://trioverlaine.com/bios/david-harding/&#34;&gt;David Harding&lt;/a&gt; and cellist &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amitpeled.com/&#34;&gt;Amit Peled&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;mozart-s-flute-quartet-no-1-in-d-major&#34;&gt;Mozart&amp;rsquo;s flute quartet no. 1 in D major&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna McGhee played in the first part of the program, which was Mozart&amp;rsquo;s first flute quartet. I was very curious how she would approach the work, because I&amp;rsquo;m very picky nowadays about the performance of music from the 18th century or earlier, which I far prefer to be both on period instruments and in period style. The typical &amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo; performance I can no longer enjoy, because of stylistic anachronisms that in my mind invalidate the beauty and freshness of early music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the quartet&amp;rsquo;s performance of the Mozart. The playing was crisp, lively, and transparent. There was little to quibble with in Lorna McGhee&amp;rsquo;s performance: she played with verve, sensitivity, and clarity. In some phrases she held a legato longer than I would like, but overall I quite liked the performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;bach-s-goldberg-variations-arranged-for-string-trio-by-dmitry-sitkovetsky&#34;&gt;Bach&amp;rsquo;s Goldberg Variations arranged for string trio by Dmitry Sitkovetsky&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bulk of the program was devoted to a performance by the string trio of the entire Goldberg Variations by Bach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past quarter century, I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to countless performances of the Goldberg Variations on all kinds of keyboard instrument, including harpsichord, fortepiano, and modern piano, but until tonight, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t bothered listening to Sitkovetsky&amp;rsquo;s arrangement for string trio that came out several years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought it worked out pretty well tonight, with the three string players working really hard to create dynamism and contrast along with unity in this monumental work. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but think that it&amp;rsquo;s actually harder to pull off as a trio than as a solo keyboard piece. What was particularly interesting was visually seeing and hearing (in the different tonal qualities) all the different voices in the music. They are there in the original version, of course, but experiencing the spatial separation just made me even more amazed by Bach&amp;rsquo;s creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciate the time the four musicians took to perform in this chamber music recital free to the public, and thank you, CMU, for bringing them in for these invigorating performances of Mozart and Bach!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby and I attended a music potluck party tonight. We had been unsure about whether to attend, since I do have the Great Race 10K to run tomorrow and need to avoid staying up too late. So we went with the understanding that we would leave early as needed, in order for me to wind down at home and go to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;food&#34;&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I whipped up a large batch of roasted vegetables to bring to the potluck:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a lot of eating and chatting, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.appalasia.com/Mimi.htm&#34;&gt;Mimi&lt;/a&gt; was ready to start jamming, and got out her &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhu&#34;&gt;erhu&lt;/a&gt;. A guy who had brought a tuba was ready to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, who else was in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pulled out my flute. Abby took out her mandolin. It seemed like nobody else (yet) was interested in joining in. (But as we know, the party usually really gets going later in the evening when musicians are involved.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tuba player seemed really into jazz. He asked for requests and started his own rhythmic bass sometimes. I tried to join in with him and Mimi as they led the way. It was pretty hard for me, and frightening, but I did what I could to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point, I volunteered to sing and play &amp;ldquo;Has Anybody Seen My Gal?&amp;rdquo; on ukulele, which I did (for the first time by myself outside home), and they followed along. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if that was the first time an erhu, tuba, and ukulele were in action simultaneously!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lending-my-flute-out&#34;&gt;Lending my flute out&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point, a guy arrived at the party who wanted to jam. He hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet brought in his trombone, but asked if he could borrow my flute. I recognized him from previous parties, and I had seen him play flute in at least one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So he borrowed my flute and I sat back and watched and listened. He was a really good improviser. Actually, at the suggestion of the tuba player, who really liked totally free improvisation, the three of them did something I found amazing and beautiful. Starting with some long tones, they created an eerie sonic soundscape together, listening to one another while blending the erhu, tuba, and flute. I was really moved by this display of musicality and feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;leaving-early&#34;&gt;Leaving early&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby noted that it was getting &amp;ldquo;late&amp;rdquo; for us, and so we regrettably had to leave. Guests were still coming in and bringing food, even though those of us who had arrived early had filled our stomachs long ago. I got my flute back and packed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is always a special treat for me when I get to hang around creative, accomplished musicians and get to see them make music spontaneously. I&amp;rsquo;m usually too intimidated in these kinds of situations to join in, but I did briefly tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-of-2013-11-06&#34;&gt;(Update of 2013-11-06)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was surprised and saddened to learn from Mimi that just a couple of days ago, the man who had borrowed my flute and played so beautifully, David Olson, &lt;a href=&#34;http://obituaries.triblive.com/listing/231895/David-E-Olson/&#34;&gt;died&lt;/a&gt;. Even in the brief time that I interacted with him at all, just in a handful of music parties, I was struck by his enthusiasm, humor, and graciousness. It is hard to believe that he is gone now, just a month since he was playing my flute. RIP, David.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Back to French dance: potluck and party</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/09/14/back-to-french-dance-potluck-and-party/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I went to a French potluck dance party at Lisa&amp;rsquo;s. For the first time, I attended without Abby, because she was up at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.snpjrec.com/&#34;&gt;SNPJ&lt;/a&gt; for an international folk dance camp; actually, we had a fairly low turnout (I counted fourteen people) because some others who would have come to the potluck are at the camp with her!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been months since I was involved with French dance or music, because I gave all that up temporarily in order to focus on &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/08/23/another-unexpected-life-change-one-month-of-learning-to-play-ukulele/&#34;&gt;learning ukulele starting less than two months ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last French potluck dance party I attended was &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/05/25/learning-the-congo-de-captieux-traditional-french-dance/&#34;&gt;almost four months ago&lt;/a&gt;. I really love this informal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;potluck&#34;&gt;Potluck&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a huge batch of vegetables for the potluck.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/french-potluck-2013-09-14/broccoli.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My simple recipe:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;three bunches of broccoli with florets and stems (sliced thinly)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extra virgin olive oil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.traderjoes.com/fearless-flyer/article.asp?article_id=149&#34;&gt;Trader Joe&amp;rsquo;s South African smoke seasoning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;two tomatoes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one onion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one clove of garlic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dancing&#34;&gt;Dancing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a photo of some dancing in action.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/french-potluck-2013-09-14/dancing.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I did not actually do much dancing this evening at all, because of my slow recovery from a &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/09/06/was-it-worth-sprinting-to-a-terrible-fall-to-finish-25th-in-the-cmu-pretty-good-race-5k/&#34;&gt;really bad injury from a week ago&lt;/a&gt;. I only did one dance. My left arm, left hip, and right knee are in constant pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did join John by playing flute along with him on button accordion. By the way, he&amp;rsquo;s planning to order a new one with more rows and more keys to play in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were not enough women tonight for pairing up. It was joked that this is a &amp;ldquo;Pittsburgh problem&amp;rdquo;, because usually when it comes to dancing, there are not enough men!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I could not really dance tonight, I appreciated the opportunity to socialize and make music, and not feel so lonely at home alone while Abby was out of town!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Finally playing Piazzolla&#39;s &#34;Oblivion&#34; on flute</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/09/13/finally-playing-piazzollas-oblivion-on-flute/</link>

      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/09/13/finally-playing-piazzollas-oblivion-on-flute/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Almost a year ago, I almost played Piazzolla&amp;rsquo;s tango &amp;ldquo;Oblivion&amp;rdquo; on flute with piano accompaniment by Henry &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/12/02/oblivion-obsession-time-to-start-playing-melodica/&#34;&gt;at a party&lt;/a&gt; but I ended up playing melodica instead of flute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having the opportunity to play with Henry again, this time I played it on flute, finally! I had found an oboe and piano arrangement which we used, sight reading it. I think the arranger filled in his own ornamentation into the melodic line. I only used that as a guide. Personally, when I play &amp;ldquo;Oblivion&amp;rdquo;, I improvise my own embellishments on the spot, depending on my mood. I play it very freely: it cries out for self-expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-of-2014-10-23-some-other-performances-of-oblivion&#34;&gt;(Update of 2014-10-23) Some other performances of &amp;ldquo;Oblivion&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/12/02/oblivion-obsession-time-to-start-playing-melodica/&#34;&gt;blog post of 2012&lt;/a&gt;, I embedded a lot of my favorite performances I found on YouTube of &amp;ldquo;Oblivion&amp;rdquo;. Here are some more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;flute-cello-piano-trio-mathilde-caldérini-zoé-karlikow-aurèle-marthan&#34;&gt;Flute/cello/piano trio (Mathilde Caldérini, Zoé Karlikow, Aurèle Marthan)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very beautiful performance, great unity and balance and expression from all three musicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/DDCB1GqwL0I&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;7-flute-choir&#34;&gt;7 flute choir&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An unusual 7-flute arrangement, with all parts played by the same person, Manja Thessin! A bonus is that the video is a beautiful demonstration of tango dancing by David and Kim Benitez of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tangomovement.com/&#34;&gt;Tango Movement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/qvzgzpft8Xg&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;j-oublie-voice-elena-lydia-stamellou&#34;&gt;J&amp;rsquo;oublie (voice), Elena-Lydia Stamellou&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lovely, pure voice with piano accompaniment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/vfP4UF_1cUY&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;piano-improvisational-gila-goldstein&#34;&gt;Piano, improvisational, Gila Goldstein&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A gorgeous, floating performance, very free, with lovely touches in filling in inner voices and adding drama effectively through contrast, detail, and improvisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/J5meF7u3HpY&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;guitar-duo-katrin-klingeberg-and-sebastián-montes&#34;&gt;Guitar duo, Katrin Klingeberg and Sebastián Montes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a partnership! A passionate performance with contrasting moods, immense focus, really captures the spirit of the piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/gONVtoQaovQ&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;guitar-solo-ryuji-kunimatsu&#34;&gt;Guitar solo, Ryuji Kunimatsu&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, one guy on guitar, all by himself, in his own arrangement, beautifully expressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/2WZBOawjNiQ&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;melodica-and-piano-one-musician-simultaneously-haim-shapira&#34;&gt;Melodica and piano, one musician simultaneously! Haim Shapira&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A novelty item, definitely. There are compromises from trying to arrange to play both melodica and piano at the same time, but this is a fascinating free arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/-R_jdtCACQw&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;piano-solo-arrangement-viktoriya-yermolyeva&#34;&gt;Piano solo arrangement, Viktoriya Yermolyeva&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very passionate performance on piano by the arranger herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/w1azi_oJGxY&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;digital-piano-solo-roland-fp4&#34;&gt;Digital piano solo (Roland FP4),&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really quite good, based on Yermolyeva&amp;rsquo;s arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/_Av7LcGRcd8&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</description>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;There was &lt;a href=&#34;http://jessicamusic.blogspot.com/2013/08/stop-dumbing-down-debussy.html&#34;&gt;much ado&lt;/a&gt; over Google&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;celebrating&amp;rdquo; Claude Debussy&amp;rsquo;s 151st birthday through a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/08/22/claude_debussy_google_doodles_claire_de_lune_for_composer_s_151st_birthday.html&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Claire de Lune&amp;rdquo; doodle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that I do totally love this piece of music, but it may well be true that many people do not know much about a lot of the other great music he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;syrinx&#34;&gt;Syrinx&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I decided to celebrate the birthday in my own way. I chose Debussy&amp;rsquo;s famous work for solo flute, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrinx_%28Debussy%29&#34;&gt;Syrinx&lt;/a&gt;, as a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, I already linked to a fine performance of it on flute &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/11/22/james-galway-made-me-hate-flute/&#34;&gt;by Emmannuel Pahud&lt;/a&gt;. There are many other good performances on flute, but inspired by &lt;a href=&#34;http://emilysdomain.org/&#34;&gt;Emily O&amp;rsquo;Brien&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/07/21/mideast-early-music-workshop-a-life-changing-experience/&#34;&gt;performance that I attended last year of Syrinx on tenor recorder&lt;/a&gt;, I looked for other non-flute performances of this music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found two intriguing ones to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tenor-recorder&#34;&gt;Tenor recorder&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One is another tenor recorder performance, by Kenjiro Hibi. This Japanese musician made it seem as though it were traditional Japanese shakuhachi music!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/6e0kag3K86Y&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;trumpet&#34;&gt;Trumpet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I found this amazing performance on trumpet, by &lt;a href=&#34;http://alisonbalsom.com/&#34;&gt;Alison Balsom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/FW-8vC9Kpfw&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this through &lt;a href=&#34;http://musicalassumptions.blogspot.com/2013/08/the-many-faces-of-syrinx-for-debussys.html&#34;&gt;someone else&amp;rsquo;s blog post on Syrinx for Debussy&amp;rsquo;s birthday&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-on-syrinx&#34;&gt;More on Syrinx&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is some interesting discussion of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flutefocus.com/232-syrinx-by-debussy.html&#34;&gt;interpretation and editions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point, of course, I must work on this piece and play it on flute. But not yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a fascination with music played in a context other than the original, such as on a different instrument. It was fun discovering some performances of Debussy&amp;rsquo;s Syrinx on recorder and trumpet.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Another unexpected life change: one month of learning to play ukulele</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/08/23/another-unexpected-life-change-one-month-of-learning-to-play-ukulele/</link>

      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/08/23/another-unexpected-life-change-one-month-of-learning-to-play-ukulele/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Almost exactly one month ago, on Monday, July 22, I vowed to spend at least a couple of minutes a day for two weeks attempting to learn to play the ukulele.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is how the story began and how it has unfolded in the past month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;jim-weirich-on-ukulele-almost-three-years-ago-december-2-2010&#34;&gt;Jim Weirich on ukulele almost three years ago (December 2, 2010)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time I ever remember seing and hearing a ukulele up close was during a Pittsburgh Ruby meetup on December 2, 2010. Jim Weirich was a guest speaker. Before his talk, he and &amp;ldquo;The Searchers&amp;rdquo; (Jean Lange on flute, Colin Dean on trumpet, Carol Nichols on clarinet) performed the Ruby song, &amp;ldquo;Has Anybody Seen My Code?&amp;rdquo; (alternate lyrics to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Has_Anybody_Seen_My_Gal%3F_%28song%29&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Has Anybody Seen My Gal?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/vKrr7aXUc1E&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately after this, I thought to myself, it would be fun to be playing ukulele and singing like Jim just did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;discovering-jake-shimabukuro-february-2011&#34;&gt;Discovering Jake Shimabukuro (February 2011)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two months later, on February 5, 2011, I accidentally came across a popular video of &lt;a href=&#34;http://jakeshimabukuro.com/&#34;&gt;Jake Shimabukuro&lt;/a&gt; playing tenor ukulele, &amp;ldquo;Ukulele weeps&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/puSkP3uym5k&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was &lt;em&gt;totally&lt;/em&gt; blown away by this performance, and was convinced of the limitless possibilities of the ukulele.  I instantly decided that I wanted to learn to play the instrument. I had never played a string instrument before: once I had tried guitar for a couple of minutes and given up forever because it had seemed way too hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;quitting-chess&#34;&gt;Quitting Chess&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, at this point in my life, I was very dissatisfied by how I was spending my time outside of work. I had been playing tournament chess, but playing very poorly and without my heart really being in it in the past months of participation. I was feeling miserable about having two more rounds to play in the 2011 Pittsburgh Chess Club Championship. (In retrospect, I should have simply dropped out rather than continue my misery. But I had this idea that I should finish out what I start. Sometimes that&amp;rsquo;s true, but in this case, it clearly was not.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very same day I discovered Jake Shimabukuro, I sent the link to my friend Farokh, telling him, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about taking up the ukulele for a while now. I tried learning guitar some years ago but the instrument was too big for me, so I&amp;rsquo;m looking for a small stringed instrument I could play a variety of music on.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I made up my mind on the spot that I was retiring from chess after finishing the tournament: the very same day I also wrote my friend Steve, &amp;ldquo;I have the idea of replacing chess with music seamlessly. If you recall, 2005 was supposed to be my &amp;lsquo;year of music&amp;rsquo;, but I started playing chess again after Christmas of 2004. It&amp;rsquo;s time to retire.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-happened-to-the-year-of-music-2005&#34;&gt;What happened to the &amp;ldquo;year of music&amp;rdquo;, 2005?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2002, I bought a flute hoping to get back to playing the instrument, after not having done so in two decades, but I quickly gave up because it seemed too hard. This despite buying exactly one piece of sheet music with the plan to play it, &amp;ldquo;Après un rêve&amp;rdquo;, which by the way I finally ended up playing a decade later, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/07/04/more-summer-musical-partying/&#34;&gt;at a party last month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2004, I decided that in 2005, I would give one more shot at playing music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Unfortunately&amp;rdquo;, on December 29, 2004, I went to a meeting of the Pittsburgh Chess Club for the first time, got hooked, and shortly after that, joined the club, and &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/08/30/why-i-do-not-play-chess-online-chess-as-a-human-activity/&#34;&gt;began playing in tournaments again for the first time in two decades&lt;/a&gt;. I spent a number of years making chess my main activity outside of work, until &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/03/10/flute-loving-it-again/&#34;&gt;I met Abby in late 2006&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flute had to wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;recorder-vs-ukulele&#34;&gt;Recorder vs. ukulele?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to February 5, 2011: this very day, I immediately told Abby that I wanted to play ukulele. She was skeptical, but had her friend Lynette lend me a soprano ukulele to try out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On February 15, 2011, after the last round of the 2011 Pittsburgh Chess Club Championship, I immediately &amp;ldquo;retired&amp;rdquo; from chess. (By the way, I &amp;ldquo;unretired&amp;rdquo; and &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/08/21/returning-to-chess/&#34;&gt;returned to tournament chess in fall 2012&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I immediately started to practice recorder regularly (because it seemed an &amp;ldquo;easy&amp;rdquo; gateway to playing any music at all without a steep learning curve: I was discouraged by my failure at flute years earlier), and also planned to start playing ukulele.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On February 19, 2011, I wrote Farokh about my progress: &amp;ldquo;After a couple of days of spending a minute or two trying to play the G7 chord on the ukulele, I can finally sort of do it, in isolation. I will keep toughening my left hand for some more days before trying to start real work on the ukulele. Meanwhile, today I took a break from the soprano recorder and started playing the alto, finally. Fingerings are the same, but the pitches are different, so it&amp;rsquo;s pretty confusing. Obviously it&amp;rsquo;s not a good idea to try to learn both simultaneously. The alto is harder to play for me because it&amp;rsquo;s bigger, but I like the sound a lot more, and in the long run, it&amp;rsquo;s more versatile, suitable for music the modern flute can play. So I may stick with the alto for a while before going back to the soprano. I&amp;rsquo;m very much enjoying getting back to music. It had kind of exited my life around five years ago (!!) since I got back into chess in 2005. I have now completely quit chess, cold turkey, to make time for music. Music is much more rewarding, in the end.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;recorder-wins-march-2011&#34;&gt;Recorder wins (March 2011)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On March 2, 2011, I finally ordered a soprano ukulele online, because the one lent to me simply had structural defects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I had the same frustrations as with the loaner ukulele. The instrument seemed very hard to play. On March 20, 2011, I went to my first meeting of the Pittsburgh Recorder Society. I was making progress with daily practice, and so I completely abandoned the ukulele. It collected dust for well over two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that I did continue with recorder, largely because I found the Pittsburgh Recorder Society and joined it, and I have been playing recorder &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/02/23/celebrating-two-years-of-playing-recorder/&#34;&gt;ever since&lt;/a&gt;, even attending my first music camp less than two years later, the week-long &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/07/21/mideast-early-music-workshop-a-life-changing-experience/&#34;&gt;summer 2012 Mideast Early Music Workshop&lt;/a&gt;, which focuses on recorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there had been a Pittsburgh ukelele group at the time, the course of my entire musical life could have been altered: I would not have spent the last two years of my musical life on recorders, modern flute, &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/baroque-flute/&#34;&gt;Baroque flute&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/irish-flute/&#34;&gt;Irish flute&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/tin-whistle/&#34;&gt;tin whistle&lt;/a&gt; (years that I treasure, so I am actually glad that I gave up ukulele when I did!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;steel-city-ruby-music-jam-august-2012&#34;&gt;Steel City Ruby music jam (August 2012)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward a year, to the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/08/22/steel-city-ruby-conf-review-part-1-its-about-people/&#34;&gt;first Steel City Ruby conference&lt;/a&gt;, where I knew Jim Weirich was going to be a speaker, and therefore that he was going to do a music jam. I brought my Irish flute, not really sure whether I was going to have the courage to join in, since I had only &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/07/02/my-first-french-music-jam-anxious-but-excited/&#34;&gt;just&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/07/03/petrified-at-a-music-jam-session-so-i-didnt-play-but-watched-and-listened/&#34;&gt;begun&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/07/07/another-terrifying-music-jam-session-but-i-played-a-little-bit-of-blues-and-old-time/&#34;&gt;music jamming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up completely chickening out and choosing to go out for lunch instead, and when I came back they were still playing and I watched. I silently vowed to myself that the following year, if Jim was coming to Steel City Ruby again, I would not chicken out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;music-from-august-december-2012&#34;&gt;Music from August-December 2012&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I launched myself into the new local French music jam, going to my &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/08/27/my-second-french-music-jam-playing-my-irish-flute-in-public-for-the-first-time/&#34;&gt;second one&lt;/a&gt; just shortly after Steel City Ruby, and then proceeding further, bit by bit overcoming my fear of being incompetent as a musician. The entire past year has been very rewarding for me musically, as I kept on practicing, playing, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/10/28/singing-and-playing-bossa-nova-favorite-chega-de-saudade-at-dunkin-donuts-for-j-jam/&#34;&gt;anywhere&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/10/27/singing-an-irish-ballad-as-an-asian-pirate-at-a-halloween-belly-dance-hafla/&#34;&gt;everywhere&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/12/09/playing-music-on-recorders-at-a-phipps-conservatory-candlelight-evening/&#34;&gt;recorders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/03/17/finally-doing-some-latin-music-jamming-on-flute/&#34;&gt;flute&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/09/08/finally-performing-some-sonatas-for-baroque-flute/&#34;&gt;Baroque flute&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/12/14/pittsburgh-contras-and-squares-holiday-ball-2012/&#34;&gt;Irish flute and tin whistle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/12/22/playing-tango-on-melodica-and-singing-christmas-carols/&#34;&gt;melodica&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/11/17/a-childhood-dream-come-true-i-am-now-finally-singing-for-real/&#34;&gt;voice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;music-from-january-july-2013&#34;&gt;Music from January-July 2013&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of my newer musical activities this year: &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/01/26/music-i-just-played-for-the-first-time-recorder-sonata-tangos/&#34;&gt;tango on flute&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/01/28/my-first-blues-music-jam-happened-after-the-regular-french-music-jam/&#34;&gt;blues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;back-to-string-instruments-viola-da-gamba-july-2013&#34;&gt;Back to string instruments? Viola da gamba (July 2013)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month, I went to the week-long Mideast Early Music Workshop for the second time. (I&amp;rsquo;m still finishing up the full report to post.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day I arrived at music camp, it turned out that the instructor for the class on &amp;ldquo;viol for the novice&amp;rdquo; was looking for one more person to show interest in learning viol (also known as viola da gamba), since there was only one student signed up at the time. (The &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viol‎&#34;&gt;viol&lt;/a&gt; is a fretted instrument that you play with a bow.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought to myself, heck, I&amp;rsquo;ll give this a shot. It would be a no-risk attempt to try again to learn the basics of playing a string instrument!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I signed up. I was lent a treble viol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was crazy hard for me to learn how to bow without making horrible sounds, and hard for me to play the most trivial melodies by fretting while bowing. Neither I nor the other beginner after just a week felt ready to even play a simple melody in the final student concert. I had spent quite a bit of time practicing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I learned a couple of things from this experience:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I really wanted to, I could play a bowed string instrument; my strokes and control were clearly getting better every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I really wanted to, I could play a fretted string instrument; I was slowly becoming able to pluck out a melody.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I really wanted to, I could learn to be competent at viola da gamba, just like all my other workshop companions who told me they had started as total beginners years ago.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that I&amp;rsquo;m not very interested in playing viola da gamba, compared to lots of other things I could be doing. But the &lt;em&gt;confidence&lt;/em&gt; that I could if I wanted to was very empowering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;guitar-ukulele&#34;&gt;Guitar, ukulele&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that in June, before my music camp, Farokh had started learning to play guitar. On July 22, two days after I returned from music camp, he told me he getting very serious about guitar. This was quite impressive because unlike me, he did not even have any musical background at all in K-12. I was deeply moved by Farokh&amp;rsquo;s dedication and seriousness as an adult latecomer to music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So on July 22, I replied to him, &amp;ldquo;I will pick up my ukulele tonight and give it a go. There&amp;rsquo;s a new Pittsburgh uke meetup so if I can actually get going with it, there is a good place to continue.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;steel-city-ukuleles&#34;&gt;Steel City Ukuleles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, there is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Steel-City-Ukuleles/&#34;&gt;Steel City Ukuleles&lt;/a&gt; meetup group. I have known about it for over a year, by accident from an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/steel-city-ukuleles-keeps-strummin/Content?oid=1506609&#34;&gt;article in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So on March 28, I had written the organizer, &amp;ldquo;Hi, I just saw a local news article about the Steel City Ukuleles. I bought a soprano ukulele a year ago but have barely started learning to play it. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in getting going on it and maybe joining the group.&amp;rdquo; I got a friendly response, but given that I could not really play, and that I was already very busy with my recorder and flute activities, I had no time to try again to learn ukulele from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no way I would attend the meetup until I was at least a beginner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;practice&#34;&gt;Practice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On July 22, I started &amp;ldquo;practicing&amp;rdquo; ukulele no more than five minutes a day (that&amp;rsquo;s as much as I could tolerate without calluses on my left fingers), and just trying to make the most basic chords after C work (which they never had earlier): G7, F. I kept on smudging and buzzing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On July 25, I was still having trouble getting an F to work. Farokh chided me for my feelings of discouragement on ukulele, saying he was making progress on guitar: &amp;ldquo;Have you practiced the F chord every day for weeks until you get it?  If not, you haven&amp;rsquo;t been sufficiently dedicated.  This is how people learn to play guitar; it&amp;rsquo;s like digging through a brick wall with a spoon!  You need to build up your dexterity.  It took me two weeks to play the G chord decently.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On July 28, six days after starting again with ukulele, and making tiny bits of progress, I wrote Farokh, &amp;ldquo;My plan with uke is to take just a few minutes a day for the next week or two, then reassess what next. I have to observe the advice I give everyone: something small every day for two weeks before giving anything up.&amp;rdquo; In my experience, when learning something new, the first two weeks can be very, very discouraging, but if you quit before the two weeks are up, you may never know how close you were to making the breakthrough that everyone else who persevered can make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On July 31, I was continuing to make progress, playing longer than five minutes at a time. Calluses started forming. Fingers became more precise. Still could barely actually play, but the improvement was real. I decided to aim to get proficient enough to attend the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Steel-City-Ukuleles/events/117972052/&#34;&gt;September 4 meeting of the Steel City Ukuleles&lt;/a&gt;. I did not feel I would be ready to attend the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Steel-City-Ukuleles/events/117972012/&#34;&gt;August 7 meeting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at least I used the trick of &lt;em&gt;committing&lt;/em&gt; to the September meeting, by posting to the August event site introducing myself and saying I planned to come in September. I wanted people to know that I was just starting out and had a month to get ready. I also wanted people to remember that when I showed up, so that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be just some random guy, but &lt;em&gt;the guy who told us a month ago he was going to come&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;books&#34;&gt;Books&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started working through some books on ukulele. Progress through them was very difficult, because some of the books just went way too fast, without explanation. These concise books are worthless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On August 3, I got hold of &amp;ldquo;The Complete Idiot&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Playing Ukulele&amp;rdquo;. This was useful, but had confusing orders of presentation and omissions in explanation. Still, I managed to learn some more chords (while still not playing anything quite right) and some fingerpicking while at it. I hit a wall pretty quickly though. The book has a lot of really hard stuff in it, and could occupy me for a year or two, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On August 10, I started working through &amp;ldquo;Ukulele for Dummies&amp;rdquo;, and made good progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;three-weeks-up&#34;&gt;Three weeks up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my three-week trial period of daily practice, I assessed my status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the ups and downs of practice, I knew that I had made tremendous progress. Sometimes I would plateau for two days but then suddenly &amp;ldquo;get&amp;rdquo; something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still had trouble with the most basic barre chord, but actually, when I counted, I had learned around twelve chords and could do some basic progressions in some keys. I was buzzing out less and my fingers were starting to go just where they needed to go (if the chord changes were slow enough). It was an amazing feeling, the feeling of &lt;em&gt;being a beginner&lt;/em&gt; rather than &lt;em&gt;being nothing at all&lt;/em&gt; (which was the feeling I had during the whole first week and part of the second week).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukulele calluses after one month:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/ukulele-calluses.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Ukulele calluses&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;bad-instrument&#34;&gt;Bad instrument?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I was getting increasingly annoyed by the fact that my instrument seems defective. The A string is sharp when fretted. I still don&amp;rsquo;t know what the problem is. I regret having bought this instrument years ago online, unseen and unplayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;steel-city-ruby-2013-august-17-18&#34;&gt;Steel City Ruby 2013, August 17-18&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://conscientiousprogrammer.com/blog/2013/08/18/steel-city-ruby-2013-my-second-year-and-it-radically-changed-my-life-again-part-1/&#34;&gt;first morning&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://steelcityruby.org/&#34;&gt;Steel City Ruby&lt;/a&gt; conference, as I was about to leave home, I suddenly had a thought. Originally I was going to bring my Irish flute to the conference, as I had last year, to join a music jam with Jim Weirich (a speaker again at the conference).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tweeted, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/franklinchen/status/368346099712786432&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Was thinking of bringing my uke to #scrc13 because of @jimweirich, but been learning it only 3 weeks, feel like imposter.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. Jim replied, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jimweirich/status/368348104397185024&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;oh yes! Please bring!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I did bring my ukulele. Early on in the day, it was announced that there would be a music jam on the second day of the conference. So the next day, I brought my ukulele in again. And so we had a music jam: Jim, PJ Hagerty, Carol Nichols, and me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was nervous, and couldn&amp;rsquo;t keep up with everything, but had a great time. It also happened to be the first time I ever played ukulele outside of just practicing at home. We did Jim&amp;rsquo;s Ruby song, the very one that I had seen him do almost three years ago at the Pittsburgh Ruby meetup, as well as his Lisp song, and a whole bunch of other stuff, like Hank Williams. (It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe, but I hadn&amp;rsquo;t played music with other people in a month, since the Mideast Early Music Workshop ended, but I was really focused on personal ukulele practice like a monk.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some photos of us (sadly without Carol, who was sitting opposite the three of us):&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;PJ, Franklin, Jim&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So I ended up playing ukulele with others sooner than I had originally intended or expected. Also, at one point I briefly swapped instruments with Jim so that I could feel what it was like to play a tenor. Surprisingly to me, although it was of course &amp;ldquo;big&amp;rdquo;, it was not as unmanageable as I feared it might be. I always imagined that eventually I&amp;rsquo;d &amp;ldquo;graduate&amp;rdquo; to playing a tenor, after first playing soprano, then concert size, sort of like my progression on recorder of first soprano, then alto, then tenor, then finally &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/03/my-new-bass-and-sopranino-recorders-and-having-fun/&#34;&gt;bass&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sunday-the-day-after&#34;&gt;Sunday: the day after&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very day after the conference jam session, I got email about the Steel City Ukuleles meeting on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Steel-City-Ukuleles/events/117971802/&#34;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. In my &amp;ldquo;planning&amp;rdquo;, I had neglected to realize that the group met twice a month, not just once a month! So I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to wait till September 4 after all. I felt I was probably already competent enough to function on Wednesday; I looked at the musical selections, and felt reassured that even if I still have problems with fast chord changes, I could participate without making a total mess of everything. So I signed up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;monday-need-better-instrument&#34;&gt;Monday: need better instrument?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to the local music store to check out concert size ukuleles, because if I need to get a better instrument, I think I might like that size better than the soprano. I have not made any decisions yet. I feel I need to improve further, to better understand instruments and try different kinds, before buying another one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;wednesday-my-first-time-at-steel-city-ukuleles&#34;&gt;Wednesday: my first time at Steel City Ukuleles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I arrived, Linda lent me an electric tenor for me to try out. I ended up playing it for the whole two hours because the intonation was good, unlike my soprano. For the most part, I did not have difficulty with the larger instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some photos:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/d/1/c/highres_274467932.jpeg&#34; /&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I ended up just leaving my soprano ukulele on the ground unused during this session:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/d/2/6/highres_274467942.jpeg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Another group photo&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As the meetup was winding down, because it got dark outside, and my fingers were tired, I captured some footage of &amp;ldquo;Has Anybody Seen My Gal?&amp;rdquo; being done by the group:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/LM1Pi2zX484&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How fitting it is that the very tune I first heard from Jim Weirich almost three years ago is the one to close out my first attendance of the Steel City Ukuleles!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-next&#34;&gt;What next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A month ago, when I was only practicing ukulele five minutes a day, I was still doing some flute practice. But I have not been playing flute or recorder for quite some time now (last time was probably a week ago). I feel bad about this, but I seem to be in ukulele mode now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to keep flute and recorder in &amp;ldquo;maintenance mode&amp;rdquo; rather than just abandon them entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, it is of course very exciting to be a beginner at ukulele. To make massive improvements on ukulele, I &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; make it my musical &lt;em&gt;focus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;instruments&#34;&gt;Instruments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linda warned me that her electric tenor ukulele has a high action. After playing it the next day at home, I realized that indeed it has a high action that shreds my left fingers. So it&amp;rsquo;s not working for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Abby yesterday brought home a concert-sized &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjo_uke&#34;&gt;banjolele&lt;/a&gt; borrowed from a friend:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it to get the feel of the concert size while continuing to practice and learn, and so far it&amp;rsquo;s been working great, giving me confidence that I should in fact buy a concert size ukulele.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-of-2013-09-23&#34;&gt;(Update of 2013-09-23)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A month later, I actually did finally &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/09/23/finally-got-a-nice-new-ukulele-mainland-classic-mahogony-concert/&#34;&gt;buy a concert ukulele&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been quite a journey, getting into music and into ukulele through seemingly chance and trivial events such as music at a Pittsburgh Ruby meetup and hearing about Jake Shimabukuro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;rsquo;m so excited that I&amp;rsquo;m playing ukulele now. It&amp;rsquo;s a whole different music world for me. I&amp;rsquo;ll write more about what I mean, as I continue to progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two weeks after my first Steel City Ukuleles meeting, I went back for more, attending &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/09/04/my-second-meeting-of-the-steel-city-ukuleles/&#34;&gt;my second meeting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        &lt;h4&gt;New floor&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/haircut-2013-08-08/wall.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Celebrity wall&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I got a haircut from my barber Joe, whom I have been seeing &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/29/my-favorite-barber/&#34;&gt;for sixteen years now&lt;/a&gt; since moving to Pittsburgh. Unexpectedly, this led me to &amp;ldquo;discovering&amp;rdquo; a piece of music and going home to play it on flute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was happy to arrive with only one other person in line, just getting into the chair, because Joe has a policy of not taking reservations, and &amp;ldquo;if you leave, you lose your turn&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/haircut-2013-08-08/lose-your-turn.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Lose your turn&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In practice, Joe usually takes 20-25 minutes per person, I figured on being out within 50 minutes. Since I was pretty exhausted because of a tough week, I took the opportunity to do some napping. In practice, I don&amp;rsquo;t really sleep, but do get rest. Since Joe always has his oldies radio station on, I try to enjoy the music (which is not the kind of music I ordinarily listen to these days) and identify songs and singers I recognize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard someone sing a song that I recognized but had never truly known. I think it&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful song, actually (from a melodic and harmonic point of view), although horribly cheesy if you pay attention to the lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recognized the song as being in &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/03/17/st-patricks-day-party-playing-tin-whistle-and-flute/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;I Used to Play Flute&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, although I did not remember the title. I did remember really enjoying playing it on flute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this evening, after dinner, I found the song in the book. It&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27ll_Always_Love_You_%28Taylor_Dayne_song%29&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll Always Love You&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. I played through the song with the CD track accompaniment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also looked for a sung performance on YouTube, and found one, by the musician who actually created it in 1987, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.taylordayne.com/&#34;&gt;Taylor Dayne&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/0bGdnMnq40s&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think this this is who I heard on Joe&amp;rsquo;s radio station. Taylor Dayne sings more wildly than whoever was on the radio (or maybe in my half-asleep state, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t paying enough attention). This is not the kind of music I was listening to in 1988, and I have to confess I cringed when watching this video, because although the performance is quite good, her style of singing is just not really to my taste! I prefer the song as an instrumental.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tito-nieves&#34;&gt;Tito Nieves&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was very amused to find a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jukebo.com/tito-nieves/music-clip,i-ll-always-love-you,u8quz.html&#34;&gt;salsa cover of this song&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tito_Nieves&#34;&gt;Tito Nieves&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty good, actually:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;width:480px;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&#34;http://www.ultimedia.com/swf/iframe_pub.php?width=480&amp;height=385&amp;id=u8quz&amp;url_artist=http://www.jukebo.com/tito-nieves/music-clip,i-ll-always-love-you,u8quz.html&amp;autoplay=0&amp;mdtk=04516441&amp;site=.fr&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; height=&#34;385&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; marginwidth=&#34;0&#34; marginheight=&#34;0&#34; hspace=&#34;0&#34; vspace=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&#34;color:#000000; font:bold 11px verdana;&#34;&gt;See all &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jukebo.com/tito-nieves/music-clip,i-ll-always-love-you,u8quz.html&#34; style=&#34;color:#000000;text-decoration:underline;  font:bold 11px verdana;&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;music videos Tito Nieves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;haircut-photos&#34;&gt;Haircut photos&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, I was delighted not only to have gotten a haircut, but also learned something about a piece of music that had up till now only been a CD track and a flute part that I had played through months ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>More summer musical partying, and another ten-year-old dream fulfilled!</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/07/04/more-summer-musical-partying/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Abby and I went to a party at Gina&amp;rsquo;s. We hadn&amp;rsquo;t been over in &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/12/22/playing-tango-on-melodica-and-singing-christmas-carols/&#34;&gt;more than half a year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a great time, sharing a ton of food (I made a cabbage dish of my own invention that included onion, garlic, olive oil, cumin seeds, thyme, lime juice, salt and pepper) and hanging out inside as well as in the backyard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I somehow started an arm wrestling competition with the guys, and then we challenged each other to pullups and chinups too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also ended up playing three games of speed chess at a time handicap (my 3 minutes to his 10 minutes). I barely managed to win all three games. The final game should have been a draw, but I won through a swindle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told Henry I was much improved musically since &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/05/03/playing-violin-music-on-flute/&#34;&gt;we played together two months ago&lt;/a&gt;. A lot of things have been falling in place for me. Of course, this only makes me be more ambitious about music to play, and in return, get humbled yet again by how much more improvement is left for me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;telemann-s-flute-sonata-in-b-minor-tmv-41-h4&#34;&gt;Telemann&amp;rsquo;s flute sonata in B minor, TMV 41:h4&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One piece we tackled was &lt;a href=&#34;http://imslp.org/wiki/Flute_Sonata,_TWV_41:h4_%28Telemann,_Georg_Philipp%29&#34;&gt;Telemann&amp;rsquo;s flute sonata in B minor, TMV 41:h4&lt;/a&gt;. I had only actually gone over the first two movements, so we were both sight reading the last two. That was something of a wreck for me, but gives me homework to do: originally I had not actually planned on learning the whole sonata, now I want to!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;bach-s-flute-sonata-in-e-major-bwv-1035&#34;&gt;Bach&amp;rsquo;s flute sonata in E major, BWV 1035&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another piece we did was &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonata_in_E_major_for_flute_or_recorder_and_basso_continuo&#34;&gt;Bach&amp;rsquo;s flute sonata in E major, BWV 1035&lt;/a&gt;, which I have already mentioned my obsession with in a &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/03/21/my-second-year-of-celebrating-johann-sebastian-bachs-birthday/&#34;&gt;blog post over three months ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: I am still not playing this on Baroque flute or modern flute, because of the difficulty! I have been working with a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.universaledition.com/Sonata-F-major-BWV-1035-for-treble-recorder-basso-continuo-Johann-Sebastian-Bach/composers-and-works/composer/32/work/4801&#34;&gt;recorder transcription for F major&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I have actually been playing more of this sonata myself in the past months, I have come to change my mind about performances I listed in that blog post! There is nothing like actually studying and playing a piece of music to change one&amp;rsquo;s perception of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite performance so far I&amp;rsquo;ve found on YouTube is by Wilbert Hazelzet on Baroque flute. It&amp;rsquo;s split over two parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/ZGtjxNeBTAs&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/Oetbg7eRa60&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Henry and I ran through the sonata. Again, I had not actually ever run through the final movement, so it was an embarrassing sight reading scramble for me. But he really enjoyed the last movement, and I did too, and realized that I wanted to actually study and practice it. It&amp;rsquo;s funny how I came to enjoy this movement much more after having tried to play it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;gabriel-fauré-après-un-rêve-fulfilling-my-ten-year-old-dream&#34;&gt;Gabriel Fauré, Après un rêve: fulfilling my ten-year-old dream&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all the Baroque stuff, I decided to play something different with Henry. I pulled out my modern flute, and we did Fauré&amp;rsquo;s song &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trois_m%C3%A9lodies,_Op.7_%28Faur%C3%A9%29&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Après un rêve&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; in a flute and piano arrangement that I bought in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a story I have never told anyone until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought that score because I was in love with the song, but never imagined that I would be able to sing it properly. So I thought to myself that if I ever played flute again (recall that the last time I had touched flute was twenty years earlier, in childhood), my goal would be to at least be able to play &lt;em&gt;this one song&lt;/em&gt; on flute reasonably close to how I feel it should be played or sung. (There is also a second piece for flute that I wanted to play as well. I will reveal it once I have actually played it with someone.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since I &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/11/09/taking-up-flute-again-after-decades/&#34;&gt;got back to flute almost two years ago&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;Après un rêve&amp;rdquo; has been on my mind as well as on my shelf, and as a measure of progres, I have actually periodically pulled it out to try to play it. For well over a year, I could not play it anywhere near how I want it to sound. Here&amp;rsquo;s a piano accompaniment track I&amp;rsquo;ve been using in the past months:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/EAAe0GDO928&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eight months ago, I fulfilled a childhood dream, by throwing myself into singing, and in fact, one song I did sing was &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/11/17/a-childhood-dream-come-true-i-am-now-finally-singing-for-real/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Après un rêve&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;! I still don&amp;rsquo;t sing it as well as I&amp;rsquo;d like, and will continue working on singing it, but singing in general has had a tremendous positive transferring effect on my flute playing! I am now almost able to play &amp;ldquo;Après un rêve&amp;rdquo; how I want (the remaining difficulties being cleaning up the high passages in the arrangement as well as controlling the breath there as well). In any case, I went and played it with Henry for the first time, and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t horrible. In summary, ten years after I bought that score with wishful thinking, I made my dream reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, here&amp;rsquo;s a nice performance on flute that inspires me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/95f57lYWgks&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;roland-de-lassus-http-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-orlande-de-lassus-as-recorder-duets&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlande_de_Lassus&#34;&gt;Roland de Lassus&lt;/a&gt;, as recorder duets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The surprise of the day was when, after watching me mess around with bass recorder, Henry got the idea of playing recorder duets with me. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t known that he played recorder. He said he could play recorders in C (soprano and tenor), and since I didn&amp;rsquo;t have my tenor on me, I gave him my soprano recorder. He picked up a book and went through it to find some early music duets that we could do on recorders. We did some with soprano and bass, then I switched to alto and we did soprano and alto for the rest we found in the book. It was immense fun!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/recorder-duets-with-henry.jpg&#34; /&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Henry and Franklin on recorders&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel blessed to have the opportunity and inspiration from Henry to continue improving at playing music, and stretch myself further. I have come so far in the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again I enjoyed hearing two groups of people playing music. I am not so much into the &amp;ldquo;old time&amp;rdquo; music, however, which the group outside in the backyard was playing, so I hung out inside instead, where I liked much better the blues guitar and ukulele and singing and piano. &lt;em&gt;I would like to join in one day&lt;/em&gt; myself, but today did not feel up to it. I never took out my flute; it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem appropriate for any of the music anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
