      <title>Yes, I want my writing to be dated!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just finished
&lt;a href=&#34;http://conscientiousprogrammer.com/blog/2015/05/31/why-i-switched-from-octopress-2-to-hugo/&#34;&gt;migrating both this blog and my programming blog from Octopress 2 to Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. During
this process, I made sure to preserve my old URLs as well as Disqus,
because nothing is as distressing to me, as a reader, as moved or
broken links when I&amp;rsquo;m looking for old blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, there&amp;rsquo;s always the possibility of changing the &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; URLs and
just using an alias with a URL redirect for the sake of old URL
schemes. One possibility was to remove dates from my URLs, e.g.,
change something like
&lt;code&gt;http://conscientiousprogrammer.com/blog/2015/05/31/why-i-switched-from-octopress-2-to-hugo/&lt;/code&gt;
to
&lt;code&gt;http://conscientiousprogrammer.com/blog/why-i-switched-from-octopress-2-to-hugo/&lt;/code&gt;. Matt
Gemmell, among many others, has argued for &lt;a href=&#34;http://mattgemmell.com/permalinks/&#34;&gt;permalinks that do not
include the clutter of embedded dates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I made the decision years ago, when I had the choice, to keep
the embedded dates, and I still stand by my decision today. Here&amp;rsquo;s why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;are-embedded-dates-actually-bad-user-interface-design&#34;&gt;Are embedded dates actually bad user-interface design?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure long date-embedded permalinks are really so bad
visually:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nobody goes around having to manually type in these links anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I believe that in the long run, people actually do care about the
date, and having it in the URL makes it that much easier to know the
date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redundancy can be a good thing, if it exposes useful information
that in theory one could determine more indirectly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-bigger-philosophical-issues&#34;&gt;The bigger philosophical issues&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the main reason I deliberately choose to expose the date of a
post is that I disagree with Matt Gemmell&amp;rsquo;s statement that one should
prefer to boost one&amp;rsquo;s article&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;standing&amp;rdquo; by giving the impression
that one is making a &amp;ldquo;definitive goddamned opinion&amp;rdquo; on a topic, some
kind of timeless statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;relevance&#34;&gt;Relevance?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that there are people who would be swayed by this
psychological trick, and I totally confess that sometimes when I do a
Web search and up pops a link to a four-year-old post, I wonder
whether to read something else instead that might be more &amp;ldquo;relevant&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as a reader who seeks genuinely useful information, no matter how
recent or old, I overcome my initial twinge at encountering an &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo;
article, and check it out for its own merits. And often, I find that
it is just fine. For example, there are some fantastic Haskell blogs
filled with information still useful today. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any of Dan Piponi&amp;rsquo;s articles are great, e.g., a random 2009 article
on
&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.sigfpe.com/2009/01/haskell-monoids-and-their-uses.html&#34;&gt;monoids and their uses&lt;/a&gt;,
with an ungainly URL of
&lt;code&gt;http://blog.sigfpe.com/2009/01/haskell-monoids-and-their-uses.html&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any of Gabriel Gonzalez&amp;rsquo;s articles are great, e.g., a 2012 article
on
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/06/you-could-have-invented-free-monads.html&#34;&gt;free monads&lt;/a&gt;
with the URL
&lt;code&gt;http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/06/you-could-have-invented-free-monads.html&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the dating is actually useful because once you see
another article by the same author with a different date, you know
which one came first and can retrace the &lt;em&gt;history&lt;/em&gt; of the author&amp;rsquo;s
thinking just throw the URL. In fact, I track my own history through
the fact that on my file system, my posts are in alphabetical order
according to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-reality-and-humanity-of-transience&#34;&gt;The reality and humanity of transience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the main fact I want to emphasize when I write is precisely
that I am not giving my definitive opinion about anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have no &amp;ldquo;forever&amp;rdquo; opinions about any topic!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I change my mind as I continue to grow and learn, and I want my
writing to reflect that, and in a way such that a reader can easily
track what changed and when. I do not write to give an illusion that I
am writing eternal truths. I do not write in order to be an authority
on a topic, but to share a snapshot of what I understand at a
particular moment in my life. When I change my mind, I do often go
back and add a dated update section linking to a new article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have retained dated permalinks for my migrated blogs, despite some
voices that argue otherwise, because of the extra information they
provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you agree that dated permalinks are worth the ugliness or not? Is
  this your opinion as an author, a reader, a critic, or a search
  engine user?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Thoughts on giving up an old project to make room for the new</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Today I made a difficult decision to give up doing something that I have enjoyed for well &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/09/12/my-first-post-on-the-chess-improver-the-value-of-thematic-complete-games-against-a-weaker-opponent/&#34;&gt;over a year now&lt;/a&gt;: writing a &lt;a href=&#34;http://chessimprover.com/category/franklin-chen/&#34;&gt;weekly chess column&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;http://chessimprover.com/&#34;&gt;The Chess Improver&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;writing&#34;&gt;Writing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a major commitment coming up with something to write about every week for such a long time. There have been times when I was overflowing with ideas; there have been times when I struggled to come up with something to write about that I could stand behind. Sometimes I have published something I felt was particularly good; sometimes I felt uninspired; sometimes I just dashed something out of uneven quality. But through it all, I learned a lot from my attempt to convey &lt;em&gt;something specific and concrete&lt;/em&gt; that I hoped readers would enjoy and ideally even use to their practical advantage in their own chess play. The best way to verify whether you actually understand something is to write about it! I definitely had to do homework in many cases in order to make sure I really understood what I was talking about, in order to be as accurate and correct as I could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I even kept on writing about chess during very dry spells in my writing in general, when I wasn&amp;rsquo;t writing anything for my other two blogs, this personal blog and my &lt;a href=&#34;http://ConscientiousProgrammer.com/&#34;&gt;programming blog&lt;/a&gt;. I admit to being rather embarrassed that during these dry spells, I kept on posting links to my chess blog from this blog. I will never again waste readers&amp;rsquo; time by posting links from one blog to another except when relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-law-of-conservation-of-time-and-energy&#34;&gt;The law of conservation of time and energy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our lives, we can&amp;rsquo;t do it all. For 2015, recent circumstances have led me to commit to a bunch of personal projects that have nothing to do with chess, so I knew, as 2014 comes to a close, that I would have to give up something &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt; in order to free up time and energy for the &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m going to writing up a retrospective on 2014 before 2015 comes, in order to plan out how to go about 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;it-s-not-really-giving-up&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not really giving up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lied in my title. I&amp;rsquo;m not really &amp;ldquo;giving up&amp;rdquo; chess writing; I&amp;rsquo;m just putting it aside. If a time comes when I feel it is worthwhile to do it again, I may well return. However, for now, I&amp;rsquo;m shutting it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All things come to an end, or at least, an adjournment. I look forward to tackling new challenges as I free myself from the responsibility of writing a weekly chess column.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you rearrange your life when you decide to start new demanding projects? Do you try to squeeze them in and cut out &amp;ldquo;non-essentials&amp;rdquo; or optimize your efficiency? Or do you decide that you have to cut out significant old projects? Or do you feel that you are already stretched to the limit with essentials (such as young children) and cannot possibly take on anything new?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Celebrating this blog&#39;s one-year anniversary</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/09/22/celebrating-this-blogs-one-year-anniversary/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;One year ago, I started this blog, inspired by my attending &lt;a href=&#34;http://podcamppittsburgh.com/&#34;&gt;PodCamp Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to write up a lengthy retrospective today, because I have to go soon to a concert Abby will be in tonight, as part of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pittsburghmandolinsociety.org/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Mandolin Society orchestra&lt;/a&gt; in Synod Hall. It was interesting rereading my own &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/21/one-month-anniversary-of-my-blog/&#34;&gt;one-month retrospective from last year&lt;/a&gt;: I&amp;rsquo;ve learned so much about myself, and other people, and changed so much, during the past year of writing here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I will say for now is: &lt;em&gt;I will continue to write for an online audience, and I expect to do this for the rest of my life&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;podcamp-pittsburgh-reminder&#34;&gt;PodCamp Pittsburgh reminder!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PodCamp Pittsburgh 7 is happening later this year than it did last year; it is coming October 27-28. There is still a &lt;a href=&#34;http://podcamppittsburgh.com/pcpgh7-speaker-submission/&#34;&gt;call for speakers&lt;/a&gt;. I remember last year some of the guys who inspired me had joked that I should start a blog and then come back the following year to talk about it. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I&amp;rsquo;m ready to do that yet, but at least it no longer sounds at all like a crazy idea!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;think-about-it&#34;&gt;Think about it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t attended PodCamp Pittsburgh before, check it out! Registration is open, and the whole weekend is &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt;! Unbelievable value for something that &lt;em&gt;changed my life forever&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The paradox of writing: doing versus writing</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/09/10/the-paradox-of-writing-doing-versus-writing/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 10 Sep 2012 08:21:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/09/10/the-paradox-of-writing-doing-versus-writing/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;For about eight months now I&amp;rsquo;ve been faced with quite a paradox: although I have written a good amount of content for my blog since I started it just under a year ago, in September 2011, the fact remains that by the end of 2011, I&amp;rsquo;d fallen way behind on writing about really important things that I had been doing in my life. I intended to catch up this year, but instead, I launched into even more significant, life-changing projects, &lt;em&gt;very few of which I have actually even reported on at all here&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-paradox&#34;&gt;What is the paradox?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paradox is that starting the blog at all was part of a larger plan to transform my life, to explore ideas, share my feelings, and try new things, and &lt;em&gt;this plan succeeded wildly&lt;/em&gt;. As a result, I became very engaged in many activities, to the point that I &lt;em&gt;had no time&lt;/em&gt; to write about the things that I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;rsquo;s about &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; versus &lt;em&gt;writing&lt;/em&gt;. With limited time and energy, I have to make choices. My choice has been to do things rather than write about them, except during a down time during which I am taking a break or when I find it easy to whip out an entire blog post off the top of my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel that my omission of &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of what I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing in my life paints a misleading picture to my readers who may be interested in following the progression of my thoughts and progress on my projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than that, I feel like I have forced myself into a false dilemma. Part of why I have &lt;em&gt;several dozen&lt;/em&gt; draft posts (about 35,000 lines of text) that I have not completed may be a lingering trace of perfectionism, under which I feel like writing a complete, fairly long blog post that has a real story line and is not just the equivalent of a short Facebook status update or tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-solution&#34;&gt;The solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the solution?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal in writing at all is to &lt;em&gt;entertain&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;edify&lt;/em&gt;. My time is extremely limited, so I don&amp;rsquo;t like wasting it by writing fluff; I feel that just writing stuff like &amp;ldquo;I did X&amp;rdquo; is pointless unless it is amusing or useful to my reader. I like writing &amp;ldquo;I did X because Y and I learned Z and I rethought A and now I want to do B and maybe you can relate and think about X or B too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that the only solution is for me to accept that I will never be able to write as much as I would like, because I prefer to spend my time &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;writing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;but-other-people-can&#34;&gt;But other people can&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see people like &lt;a href=&#34;http://sethgodin.typepad.com/&#34;&gt;Seth Godin&lt;/a&gt; turning out very short but pointed blog posts frequently. I think it&amp;rsquo;s time for me to learn from that model. Often, I could get more to the point with brief posts rather than long reports. So I think I will move in this direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal set almost a year ago to keep my blog truly regular and active has been difficult to achieve because my desire to write long posts has conflicted with my increasing involvement in other activities. I chose to simply not write rather than write half-baked posts. But there is another option to explore: being more concise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-your-writing-strategy&#34;&gt;What is your writing strategy?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you write, how do you manage a regular writing plan and schedule, as you get busy? How do you feel about short versus long posts? Do you prefer to write nothing rather than have to write something short?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Liebster Blog Award: 5 blogs you should check out</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/01/29/liebster-blog-award-5-blogs-you-should-check-out/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2012 13:04:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/01/29/liebster-blog-award-5-blogs-you-should-check-out/</guid>
      <description>&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/liebster-award.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Liebster Blog Award&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Recently, my neighbor gave me a Liebster Blog Award. This is actually my second one, but I had not yet claimed the first one, under the rules of acceptance of the award. I&amp;rsquo;ve had difficulty finding the origin of this award and the official documentation of the award, but from what I can tell, the rules are that I must give the award to five other bloggers who have fewer than 200 followers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thank the giver and link back to the blogger who gave it to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reveal your top five picks and let them know by leaving a comment on their blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy and paste the award on your blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have faith that your followers will spread the love too!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here goes, starting with identifying the two people who gave me the award:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-two-who-gave-me-an-award&#34;&gt;The two who gave me an award&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;dana-dana-is-a-geek-http-danaisageek-com&#34;&gt;Dana: &lt;a href=&#34;http://danaisageek.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dana is a Geek&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first person to give me the Liebster award is a Pittsburgh local, Dana, who is actually inadvertently responsible for my getting into social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, through her talk on &lt;a href=&#34;http://hootsuite.com/&#34;&gt;HootSuite&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;http://podcamppittsburgh.com/&#34;&gt;PodCamp Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt; 5, in 2010. I still use HootSuite to this day. I also stopped by her talk yet again last year at PodCamp Pittsburgh 6 for a refresher, and it was actually after that when I finally decided to get serious about Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/DIuG4G8hOzY?list=PL6F136EEC5F65EBDA&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dana gave me the award back &lt;a href=&#34;http://danaisageek.com/2011/11/23/liebster-blog-awar/&#34;&gt;in November&lt;/a&gt;, but I was crazy busy then and decided to put off the hard work of properly accepting the award; that task went deep into my stack of to-do items, but has finally been taken out of the stack!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dana, like me, started blogging in earnest after PodCamp Pittsburgh 6. She writes on a variety of topics, including the cool activities she does with her kids, comments on current events she feels strongly about, and reflections on learning and living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;becca-the-earthling-s-handbook-http-articles-earthlingshandbook-org&#34;&gt;Becca: &lt;a href=&#34;http://articles.earthlingshandbook.org/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Earthling&amp;rsquo;s Handbook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Becca is my next-door neighbor. She gave me the award just over &lt;a href=&#34;http://articles.earthlingshandbook.org/2012/01/20/liebster-blog-award/&#34;&gt;a week ago&lt;/a&gt;, not knowing that I already had been given the award (but not yet accepted it!). After that, there was no way I could postpone indefinitely my acceptance of the award.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Becca writes about all kinds of things she cares about, including her journey as she raises her son, her family&amp;rsquo;s experiments in healthy and tasty cooking, and her commitment to an environmentally sound way of living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;criteria-for-choosing-five-blogs-to-give-the-liebster-award-to&#34;&gt;Criteria for choosing five blogs to give the Liebster award to&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve postponed choosing five blogs to give the Liebster award to because of the constraints. I follow a good number of blogs, but most of them are quite popular and probably have a lot more than 200 followers. Nobody knows exactly how many followers a blog has, but I understand that the spirit of the award is to give it to people whose blogs are not so widely followed. I don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily know whether a particular blog is widely followed, but I&amp;rsquo;ll go by my gut feel of how popular a blog might be (based on number of comments, whether the site also has mailing lists, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have in mind that ideally I should pick blogs that my readers are likely to find useful and read. However, my readers have diverse interests, so I should pick blogs that give at least some representation of the different interests, e.g., I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t pick blogs just dedicated to Pittsburgh or software development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen blogs that are pretty active or hope to encourage to become more active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;five-blogs-for-you-to-check-out&#34;&gt;Five blogs for you to check out&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;outside-my-window-http-www-wqed-org-birdblog&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wqed.org/birdblog/&#34;&gt;Outside My Window&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This local blog is very active, and written by Kate St. John, who apparently works at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wqed.org/&#34;&gt;WQED&lt;/a&gt; in Pittsburgh. I have never met her, but enjoy her blog because she posts photos all the time of nature, especially birds and trees, along with interesting information and musings of hers. Following her blog is like following the local seasons. If you live in our part of the country, you should definitely subscribe to her blog and get a daily treat!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;andrew-cox-http-andrewcox-org&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://andrewcox.org/&#34;&gt;Andrew Cox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a local personal blog by Andrew Cox, a software developer whom I must have first encountered probably no more than a year or so ago, at a &lt;a href=&#34;http://pghrb.heroku.com/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Ruby&lt;/a&gt; meeting. Amusingly, I got to know him better largely through his blog and Twitter, although nowadays I run into him often in the Pittsburgh software developer user group scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out we have various interests in common beyond being practicing software developers. Andrew is passionate about both learning and teaching in the most general sense. We also pursue health and fitness experiments to improve ourselves. He writes about all these subjects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrew tends not to post on his blog very often, but usually when he does, he writes long, substantial articles that deserve close reading. So subscribe to his blog, and when he isn&amp;rsquo;t posting, check out his archives too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;well-i-m-back-http-robert-ocallahan-org&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://robert.ocallahan.org/&#34;&gt;Well, I&amp;rsquo;m Back&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This personal blog is written by Rob O&amp;rsquo;Callahan, an old &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/roc/public/www/index.html&#34;&gt;computer science&lt;/a&gt; classmate of mine. He is from New Zealand and loves it so much that he moved back sometime after coming to the United States for grad school and work. He has strong opinions about everything and writes about many things, including his &lt;a href=&#34;http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/news/mozillas-nz-boss-works-to-keep-the-web-wide-open&#34;&gt;working for Mozilla&lt;/a&gt; as a practicing advocate of open Web standards and browsers, technical tidbits, comments on culture, and his outings at home, complete with the breathtaking photos that are why I enjoy following his blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before meeting Rob long ago, I&amp;rsquo;d always wanted to visit New Zealand, but seeing his photos regularly keeps reminding me that Abby and I must go some day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;software-carpentry-http-software-carpentry-org-blog&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://software-carpentry.org/blog/&#34;&gt;Software Carpentry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog is very active, and written by Greg Wilson (whom I do not know), the project lead for the Software Carpentry project, whose goal is to help scientists (and others who are not professional software developers) learn and improve their software development skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes Software Carpentry special is the strong emphasis on actually making use of empirical educational research, trying out ideas to see if they work, and maintaining an open source philosophy of sharing and building community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I follow this blog because I have a long-term interest in helping non-specialists learn computer science and programming. Especially given the very recent craze over &lt;a href=&#34;http://codecademy.com/&#34;&gt;Codecademy&lt;/a&gt; and other &amp;ldquo;learn to code&amp;rdquo; initiatives, I think it is very important to be informed on what insights people who have been teaching programming for many years now have to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how many followers this blog has, and therefore whether it qualifies under the terms of the Liebster Award, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to assume that it should be read more than it is, by anyone who cares about the hard task of bringing computational fluency to everyone who can benefit from it, not just those studying for a computer science degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;mathbabe-http-mathbabe-org&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mathbabe.org/&#34;&gt;mathbabe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very active blog by Cathy O&amp;rsquo;Neil, who is a mathematician (formerly in academia and formerly in a hedge fund), a mother, an activist. She writes about whatever is on her mind. She has strong opinions and sometimes uses strong language. Much of what she writes about has a quantitative bent, e.g., her explorations of economics, finance (including her involvement with Occupy Wall Street), programming with Python and R; but she has also written about being a female geek and math education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like real-time exploration of serious issues, and don&amp;rsquo;t mind seeing strong opinions (especially political) you may or may not agree with, check out her blog!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon deciding on five blogs to bestow the Liebster award on, I hereby finally accept the Liebster award for myself, and I thank all of you who read my blog and hope you check out the blogs I have recommended! (I also hope the recipients come up with their own lists for us all to check out.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What topics do you want me to write about in 2012?</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/12/19/what-topics-do-you-want-me-to-write-about-in-2012/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 19 Dec 2011 23:45:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/12/19/what-topics-do-you-want-me-to-write-about-in-2012/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has not yet been &lt;em&gt;three months&lt;/em&gt; since I &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/09/22/starting-a-new-web-site/&#34;&gt;started this blog&lt;/a&gt;. I have managed to post something every single day since I started, apart from my decision over a month ago to &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/11/12/starting-a-mini-digital-sabbath/&#34;&gt;take Saturday off&lt;/a&gt;. Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve proved to myself that I can maintain the &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/09/26/i-dont-feel-like-practicing-but-im-gonna-do-it-anyway/&#34;&gt;habit&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m going to take a break (coinciding with the winter holidays), reflect more deeply on where my blog has explored, and plan out and implement some &lt;strong&gt;major changes and improvements&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I strongly believe that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_content#Content_is_king&#34;&gt;content is king&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This is why I have deliberately focused entirely on content in the past three months, rather than on format, tone, and style, even when I became increasingly aware of areas of improvement outside the area of content. I will work on those other areas for 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I would like to improve the content as well, by making it more useful to you. I am listing here just a few of the broad topic ideas I expect to address in future posts (many of the topic areas have already appeared in the past three months, while others have not).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you want to read here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are topics on this list (or &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; on this list) you are particularly interested in reading about here, let me know; I will take all requests seriously!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list, roughly organized by topic but not in any particular order (and by no means exhaustive):&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>One month anniversary of my blog</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/10/21/one-month-anniversary-of-my-blog/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 21 Oct 2011 22:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/10/21/one-month-anniversary-of-my-blog/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I created this blog one month ago, on &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/09/22/starting-a-new-web-site/&#34;&gt;September 22&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have achieved my short-term milestone of creating at least one post every day. This has not been a trivial task, and there have been times when I felt pressed for time or tired or was not excited about deciding what to write about and then doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I knew I had to develop the habit, and overcome perfectionism, and just get going. I&amp;rsquo;ve known too many people who started a blog, posted to it exuberantly for a while, and then didn&amp;rsquo;t continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some ways I have managed to go an entire month so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;advice-from-podcamp-pittsburgh-6&#34;&gt;Advice from PodCamp Pittsburgh 6&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began my new blog only after having attended &lt;a href=&#34;http://podcamppittsburgh.com/podcamp-pittsburgh-6/pcpgh6-sessions/&#34;&gt;PodCamp Pittsburgh 6&lt;/a&gt; and listening to enough advice that I had a strategy planned to get a strong start. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t start a new business without having an idea what I was doing, nor would I start a new computer program without having some tools and goals in mind, and writing for a blog is no different as a demanding enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;social-storytelling-by-shawn-graham-and-tom-kubilius&#34;&gt;Social storytelling, by Shawn Graham and Tom Kubilius&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to thank &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/shawngraham&#34;&gt;Shawn Graham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/tomkubilius&#34;&gt;Tom Kubilius&lt;/a&gt; for their session on &amp;ldquo;social storytelling&amp;rdquo;. To tell the truth, there is much they said (that I took notes on) that I have not yet implemented, but here is some of what I have consciously put into practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-do-i-care-about&#34;&gt;What do I care about?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shawn and Tom repeatedly emphasized knowing your &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; and what you care about. So when I write, I really do write about what I care about. There are a lot of things I could write about, but don&amp;rsquo;t, because I don&amp;rsquo;t really care about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This piece of advice has helped me stay focused on what I care about rather than what might be easy for me to write about but with less or no passion. For example, instead of writing about something I already know well, I&amp;rsquo;ll write about something I&amp;rsquo;m discovering and learning &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;. Since I do not really care much about the past, I do not bring it up unless it is a relevant prelude to a story from &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;be-committed-and-be-regular&#34;&gt;Be committed, and be regular&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where I got my idea of &lt;em&gt;committing&lt;/em&gt; to post &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; day. They didn&amp;rsquo;t tell anyone how often to be posting, but I decided on that schedule for myself, knowing that the more spaced out a new activity is, the less likely I can keep it going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;be-social&#34;&gt;Be social&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shawn put up a nice blog post shortly after PodCamp Pittsburgh 6 that discussed the &lt;a href=&#34;http://shawngraham.me/index.php/blog/the-golden-rule-of-successful-social-engagement&#34;&gt;golden rule of social engagement&lt;/a&gt;. My online activity cannot exist in a vacuum. For many years, I lurked and read a lot online but never commented. I&amp;rsquo;ve changed that &amp;ldquo;anti-social&amp;rdquo; behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, when I am reading a blog, and feel compelled to respond to a post, I strongly consider doing so if I feel I can maybe make a contribution. At times, I just submit a short comment at the article&amp;rsquo;s commenting system. Other times, I write my own article and post the URL of it as a comment. I find it useful to be inspired by some topic of discussion that other people already care out and started to talk about. Even if things do not progress beyond just my leaving a note, I know that I have planted a seed, and since the web is forever, the conversation can always be started back up by someone sometime later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(By the way, I am working on a blogroll of recommended sites I will put up on my web site.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;blogging-201-by-burghbaby-and-firemom&#34;&gt;Blogging 201, by @burghbaby and @FireMom&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At PodCamp Pittsburgh 6, I also attended &amp;ldquo;Blogging 201&amp;rdquo; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/burghbaby&#34;&gt;@burghbaby&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/FireMom&#34;&gt;@FireMom&lt;/a&gt;, another very informative session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/HwmsFdxsJmU?list=PL6F136EEC5F65EBDA&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;why-answers-a-lot&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why&amp;rdquo; answers a lot&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theme was repeated that a blogger should know the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; of what they&amp;rsquo;re doing, because all kinds of questions or dilemmas can be answered that way: frequency, tone, topics, appropriate language, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started writing only after knowing I had some pretty strong intuitions of why I&amp;rsquo;m doing it. Still, recently I have been thinking of tightening up those intuitions even further, and writing up a really specific &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; page to put up on my site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;finding-fodder&#34;&gt;Finding fodder&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The session had a ton of good advice on this topic.  I&amp;rsquo;ll just mention one of the useful points: keeping track of ideas to later write about. I keep a log of ideas that come to me (in fact, one just came to me when I was last in the shower), so that I have no shortage of topics to write about in case I either come up dry (as far as exciting experiences during a day) or find some connection with some other idea I want to write about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;blogging-boundaries-by-miss-britt&#34;&gt;Blogging boundaries, by Miss Britt&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PodCamp session by &lt;a href=&#34;http://miss-britt.com/&#34;&gt;Miss Britt&lt;/a&gt; was very energetic and insightful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-is-your-intent&#34;&gt;What is your intent?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britt noted that once upon a time, she used her blog to vent, and that led to a lot of trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to keep this in mind when I&amp;rsquo;m writing about something and I might be feeling annoyed. I think that my tone in a few of my posts so far has veered slightly into &amp;ldquo;venting&amp;rdquo; territory, but that is not where I intend to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;live-a-life-worth-writing-about&#34;&gt;Live a life worth writing about&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advice to have a life to write about somehow really stuck with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On days when I do something new and exciting, it is usually pretty easy to write something about it. So if I&amp;rsquo;ve run in a 5K race or tried a new recipe when cooking or learned something at a seminar, it&amp;rsquo;s fairly easy for me to write a post about my experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I even joked to a friend that I was engaged in &amp;ldquo;Blog-Driven Living&amp;rdquo;. Of course, it was just a joke: I have never done something arbitrary just to have something to write about, and never will. But interestingly, a different dynamic has developed: sometimes when there is a project I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to start, or complete, but have put off, I realize, &amp;ldquo;It would be nice if I actually got my act together and did it, so that I could write about it&amp;rdquo;, and do it! Blogging has actually improved my offline productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lunch&#34;&gt;Lunch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last day of PodCamp Pittsburgh 6, I was eating lunch and &lt;a href=&#34;http://justinkownacki.com/&#34;&gt;Justin Kownacki&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.robjdic.com/&#34;&gt;Rob de la Cretaz&lt;/a&gt; happened to sit near me. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t talking with them (to be honest, I was dead tired from the weekend and was just trying to eat my lunch alone and then take a long nap immediately afterwards), but overheard them discussing the past, present, and future of PodCamp Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I piped in, saying I had come the previous year, and learned some things but had not yet started the blog I wanted to start. They basically just said, do it, and don&amp;rsquo;t worry about whether it&amp;rsquo;s perfect right off the bat. Just get started, now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me several days to make the plunge, but I did do it. Thanks again, Justin and Rob!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;seth-godin&#34;&gt;Seth Godin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I must mention Seth Godin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/&#34;&gt;Seth Godin&lt;/a&gt; is my hero. He&amp;rsquo;s written a bunch of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/books.asp&#34;&gt;books&lt;/a&gt;, some of which I&amp;rsquo;ve actually read or browsed, before discovering his &lt;a href=&#34;http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, which I recommend subscribing to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very day after I started my blog, I saw his post on &lt;a href=&#34;http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/09/talkers-block.html&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;talker&amp;rsquo;s block&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and have had it in my web browser as a &amp;ldquo;permanent tab&amp;rdquo; since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Godin basically says, we don&amp;rsquo;t have talker&amp;rsquo;s block, so why should we have writer&amp;rsquo;s block? Reflecting on this, I knew that I was going to write as though I were talking. So here I am. The quality of my blog posts has varied. I know that. But that&amp;rsquo;s OK, because what matters is where I am and where I am going, not where I have been. I know I will improve considerably with time and experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One month of blogging, and I&amp;rsquo;m still at it, and still striving to improve at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, everyone, for your help!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Improving navigation on my blog</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/10/20/improving-navigation-on-my-blog/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Oct 2011 21:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/10/20/improving-navigation-on-my-blog/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I finally got down and dirty, and made some much-needed additions to my blog. I had delayed this work because my priority since starting the blog a month ago was to write content. I took time off today from writing content, in order to improve the navigation on my blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the main improvements I have made:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tags&#34;&gt;Tags&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally came up with a &lt;a href=&#34;../../tags/&#34;&gt;tags page&lt;/a&gt;, and added it to the navigation bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://octoopress.org&#34;&gt;Octopress&lt;/a&gt; does not yet have a default plugin to create such a page, but I found and modified some &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mattfoster/mattfoster.github.com/edit/master/Rakefile&#34;&gt;Ruby code&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;code&gt;Rakefile&lt;/code&gt; in order to generate my tags page. I hope this will be helpful to readers who may up till now have been confused because of the variety of topics I write about. I had made a decision up front to write about everything in this blog, rather than compartmentalize my life into different blogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An improvement I will add later: make it easy for readers to subscribe using RSS their chosen tag subsets of my blog, so that those only interested in, say, my posts about running, can subscribe to an RSS feed that only includes those posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-me&#34;&gt;About me&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, I compressed the &amp;ldquo;about me&amp;rdquo; aside, with the intention of eventually creating a detailed &amp;ldquo;about me&amp;rdquo; page linked off the navigation bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;contact-me&#34;&gt;Contact me&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created a &lt;a href=&#34;../../contact/&#34;&gt;contact&lt;/a&gt; page, and added links to it from the navigation bar and the &amp;ldquo;about me&amp;rdquo; aside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;404&#34;&gt;404&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created a custom &lt;a href=&#34;../../404.html&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;page not found&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; page, since the default page was useless.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/10/18/disagreement-on-the-use-of-time/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, I went to the monthly meeting of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/lukas/pcars/Welcome.html&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh chapter&lt;/a&gt; of the American Recorder Society. I stopped by the room where beginner lessons were being held. I don&amp;rsquo;t go to those lessons any more, because I would say I&amp;rsquo;m an intermediate recorder player now. Fred, our director, was working with two women on soprano recorder. One of them was Rhonda, who had actually joined the local group at exactly the same time as me, back in March. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen her in a while and asked where she&amp;rsquo;d been. She said she had been playing French horn in the summer, so was getting back to recorder now. She happened to joke to the other woman, an older woman, that I was really serious and had been practicing an hour every day since starting out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, the other woman (whom I don&amp;rsquo;t remember ever having met before) immediately launched into some remarks I found snarky. She said, &amp;ldquo;Well, that&amp;rsquo;s probably an hour he&amp;rsquo;s not washing dishes.&amp;rdquo; I paused in shock, and then she continued, &amp;ldquo;Or an hour he&amp;rsquo;s not taking out the trash.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was not quite sure how to respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-response&#34;&gt;My response&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this could have been an opportunity for me to use &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/11/communicating-through-dialogue/&#34;&gt;dialogue&lt;/a&gt; and try to understand why she said what she said, and what she really meant by her words that I found disparaging. In fact, thanks to my raised awareness from learning about dialogue just recently, at least I did not get angry or lose my temper. But I decided at the time that I was just passing by and was not interested in going off on a tangent, since I was heading back to the other room to set up my instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I simply replied calmly that actually, the hour of my time that went to recorder practice came out of time I used to spend on various forms of entertainment. I said that I don&amp;rsquo;t watch any TV and I don&amp;rsquo;t watch any movies. She didn&amp;rsquo;t respond to that. For all I know, she might be one of the average Americans who watch &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.csun.edu/science/health/docs/tv&amp;amp;health.html&#34;&gt;4 hours of TV a day&lt;/a&gt;, and perhaps I unintentionally offended her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Disclaimer: I am not one of those snobs who summarily look down on people who watch TV. I used to watch a lot of TV. In fact, I cannot imagine what my life would be today without having had access to TV, which expanded my emotional and intellectual world. But that was then; now, I simply make different choices with my time.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I left the room and didn&amp;rsquo;t see her again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;rsquo;m still curious about why she seemed annoyed that I spent an hour a day practicing music, as though I&amp;rsquo;m not getting chores done. I won&amp;rsquo;t speculate about why, since the only right way to satisfy my curiosity would be to ask her myself, and I passed up the opportunity to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My brief response to her was meant to convey a simple message: time management is important for all of us with our busy lives, but I&amp;rsquo;ve made certain choices, sacrificing some activities in order to gain others. The decisions are often quite difficult, because I have a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; number of interests, and therefore have to sacrifice the majority of them in order to focus on the fewer that I have decided are most worthwhile to pursue. A breadth-first traversal of all possible life activities would result in completing nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;trading-passive-for-active&#34;&gt;Trading passive for active&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of my choices involve trading passive experiences for active experiences. Here are some examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an earlier blog post, I already mentioned why &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/02/i-love-music-but-rarely-listen-to-it-now/&#34;&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t listen to music much&lt;/a&gt; any more, because of time constraints. In effect, I traded listening to music for playing music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;sports&#34;&gt;Sports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of watching sports, I engage in my own competitive physical activity, to become the athlete instead of the spectator. I enjoy &lt;a href=&#34;../../categories/races/&#34;&gt;running races&lt;/a&gt;. I am hardly super fast; at my fastest, I did periodically win age group medals and trophies, but only because competition happened not to be very tough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;exercise&#34;&gt;Exercise&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I run considerably less than I used to. One reason is that once upon a time, I got into a competitive mode, trying to see how fast I could race, and now I am no longer in that mode. It takes too much time and energy. Another reason is that I decided, based on personal experience and learning from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_lifestyle&#34;&gt;paleo/primal&lt;/a&gt; movement, that too much distance running isn&amp;rsquo;t actually all that great for my overall balanced health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I traded distance training time for &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/09/24/roaring-like-a-lion-on-a-saturday-morning/&#34;&gt;yoga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/17/the-joys-of-convict-conditioning-bodyweight-exercising/&#34;&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I no longer run any more than every other day on average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;reading&#34;&gt;Reading&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always read a lot. I still do, using not only the vast web, but also the old-fashioned &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/09/30/free-to-the-people-since-1895/&#34;&gt;local library&lt;/a&gt;. (Pittsburghers, please &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ourlibraryourfuture.org/&#34;&gt;vote on November 8&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, at some point I had to make peace with the fact that I could not read everything I might be interested in reading. Abby and I worked on selling or donating over a thousand (!!) books I owned but were just taking up space. It was very difficult parting with them, since one of my childhood dreams had been to build up a large personal library, but reason prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still encounter too much reading material, thanks to the web. I have tried to limit it by using Google Reader exclusively to access information, and never aimlessly loading up web sites, but I have to confess it is still hard to be selective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, now I am writing for my blog, so I am trading reading time for writing time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;computer-programming-languages&#34;&gt;Computer programming languages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to be a big computer language hobbyist. I enjoyed learning and playing with dozens of programming languages: if a language exists, I&amp;rsquo;ve probably at least seen sample code and written some sample code for it at some point. I was even obsessed enough with the concept of designing good programming languages that for a while I was enrolled in the Ph.D. program in computer science at CMU, specializing in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fox/languages.html&#34;&gt;programming language theory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then as a practicing software developer, I eventually realized that to &lt;em&gt;get stuff done&lt;/em&gt;, I needed to scale back on my hobby. Therefore, for example, as I mentioned in my post about &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/16/pittsburgh-software-developer-communities/&#34;&gt;local software developer groups&lt;/a&gt;, I have ceased following Python. Also, I have deliberately not even looked at new languages such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://fantom.org/&#34;&gt;Fantom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://gosu-lang.org/&#34;&gt;Gosu&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/Kotlin/Welcome&#34;&gt;Kotlin&lt;/a&gt;. (On the other hand, I am committed to learning and using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scala-lang.org/&#34;&gt;Scala&lt;/a&gt; more, because the path from Java already exists.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took only a quick look at Google&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dartlang.org/&#34;&gt;Dart&lt;/a&gt; after the big hype, and am not pursuing it further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trade-off: trading time spent playing with new languages for time spent mastering and implementing programs with old languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;completely-abandoning-an-activity&#34;&gt;Completely abandoning an activity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I have freed up time by completely abandoning an activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;dancing-part-one&#34;&gt;Dancing (part one)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, I did a lot of ballroom dancing. I even trained seriously and entered competitions through the &lt;a href=&#34;http://cmubdc.org/&#34;&gt;CMU ballroom dance club&lt;/a&gt;. I was dancing something like 20 hours a week (note: this was when I was not doing any reading or music or chess, as my trade-off). I quit competitive ballroom dancing eventually, and then even social ballroom dancing. I had also taken up swing and tango, and salsa more seriously, but then quit those too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, my trade-off was that I completely quit dancing and took up chess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chess&#34;&gt;Chess&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, chess was the most time-consuming hobby in my life. A couple of years ago, I was bent on finally achieving a national &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_master&#34;&gt;Master&lt;/a&gt; title. I studied hard, improved my game, played a lot. I won the &lt;a href=&#34;http://pscfchess.org/results/06040808.htm&#34;&gt;2006 Pennsylvania Game/29 Championship&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://pscfchess.org/results/06101414.htm&#34;&gt;2006 Pennsylvania Action Chess Championship&lt;/a&gt;; I was on the verge of making Master by planning to win the &lt;a href=&#34;http://pscfchess.org/results/07071414.htm&#34;&gt;2007 Pennsylvania Action Chess Championship&lt;/a&gt; when I utterly &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choke_(sports)&#34;&gt;choked&lt;/a&gt; and blew it by losing the last two games. I never really recovered from that. My life was changing at the time, having just starting to date Abby, and I stopped playing after a while, then after being married, I started playing again, but my heart was not in it, and I played terribly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quit chess in February 2011. In effect, I traded chess for starting to play recorder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not played any chess since February. I don&amp;rsquo;t really regret it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;update-of-2013-01-23&#34;&gt;(Update of 2013-01-23)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, in the first half of 2012, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/02/07/on-playing-my-first-games-of-chess-in-a-year/&#34;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/05/31/some-pretty-attacking-chess-at-a-party-last-weekend/&#34;&gt;casual&lt;/a&gt; contact with chess led me to feel like playing again, and in August I &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/08/21/returning-to-chess/&#34;&gt;decided to start playing in tournaments again&lt;/a&gt; and am right now in the middle of a &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/01/16/pittsburgh-chess-club-championship-2013-round-1-the-art-of-swindling/&#34;&gt;six-week tournament&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve gone back to the chess with clear constraints on how much time and energy I spend on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;update-of-2015-12-21&#34;&gt;(Update of 2015-12-21)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four years later, I made a focused push, temporarily putting many
things aside in my life, in the fall of 2015 to &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2016/01/22/on-finally-achieving-the-us-national-master-chess-title-at-age-45-part-1&#34;&gt;achieve my US Chess
National Master title&lt;/a&gt;, and finally made it, a dream come true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I have been teaching private lessons since 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;dancing-part-two&#34;&gt;Dancing (part two)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I accidentally first met Abby when I returned to salsa dancing while still playing chess. Eventually, we started dating, and we were going dancing frequently, but eventually we both completely quit salsa dancing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trade-off was that we got into hiking and kayaking together, which was more fulfilling than our going to dances together and my wanting to dance with a lot of women but her only wanting to dance with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I consciously traded dancing for a relationship and marriage!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;update-of-2013-01-23-1&#34;&gt;(Update of 2013-01-23)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, Abby and I accidentally ended up doing some dancing together again, including discovering &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/01/23/discovering-french-traditional-dance-in-pittsburgh/&#34;&gt;French dancing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/03/31/my-first-sampling-of-english-country-dance-and-contra-dance/&#34;&gt;English country and contra dancing&lt;/a&gt;. We don&amp;rsquo;t do it regularly, but it&amp;rsquo;s been great doing it on occasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, for 2013, we decided that we should dance together a little bit every day, just for ourselves, simply to appreciate that we can!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;marriage&#34;&gt;Marriage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Married life is a lot of trade-offs.  It&amp;rsquo;s nothing resembling single life or dating life!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time is precious. We all have to make trade-offs. I&amp;rsquo;ve explored some ways in which I made certain trade-offs at certain points in my life. In your own life, do you periodically double-check what your priorities are, when you feel &amp;ldquo;too busy&amp;rdquo; for something you think you value?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
