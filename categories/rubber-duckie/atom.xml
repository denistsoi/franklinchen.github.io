&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been over a week since I &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/10/05/performing-with-the-steel-city-ukuleles-at-the-wilkins-school-community-center-ecofest-2013-with-videos/&#34;&gt;performed as part of the Steel City Ukuleles in the Wilkins School Community Center Ecofest&lt;/a&gt;. I was very relieved to have no more self-imposed performance obligations for a while, feeling burned out for a while, to tell the truth. But I was ready to get back into playing just for fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;members-choice&#34;&gt;Members&amp;rsquo; choice!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a fun &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Steel-City-Ukuleles/events/140097142/&#34;&gt;session this week&lt;/a&gt; in which all of us had earlier been invited to submit music we personally wanted to play. I had submitted &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Sandman&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mister Sandman&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, a song I&amp;rsquo;ve loved since (amusingly) first hearing it when watching &amp;ldquo;Back to the Future&amp;rdquo; way back. I was really excited to finally be singing it and playing it with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did various other member-contributed selections also, including a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cups_%28song%29&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Cups&amp;rdquo; song&lt;/a&gt; that apparently has become all the craze because of moving cups around as part of percussion! Three of us had practiced ahead of time to play the cups. I have to say I was impressed:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/cups.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Cups&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;rubber-duckie&#34;&gt;Rubber Duckie&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went over &amp;ldquo;Rubber Duckie&amp;rdquo; again. I love this song. I&amp;rsquo;m getting better at singing and strumming it simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;kazoo&#34;&gt;Kazoo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally bought a cheap kazoo for use in the future (several of us used kazoos in the Ecofest performance, but I did not have a kazoo at the time), as Jack got a whole bunch to sell to us:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/kazoo.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Kazoo&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed getting back to just plain fun with singing and playing ukulele, with no more performances in the near future that I&amp;rsquo;ve volunteered to be a part of.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rubber Duckie and Steel City Ukuleles rehearsal</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Steel-City-Ukuleles/events/132647852&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s Wednesday meeting of the Steel City Ukuleles&lt;/a&gt; was an unusual one: it was split into two halves, the first half being our regular meeting (involving going through a new playlist), the second half being the second of three &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/09/26/first-rehearsal-for-my-first-ukulele-gig/&#34;&gt;rehearsals for the Ecofest gig&lt;/a&gt;. The deal was that everyone was open to stick around for the rehearsal if they wanted to, but with the caveat that it was serious rehearsal time, rather than the more casual regular meetup atmosphere. It turned out that a few people who were not performing in the Ecofest gig did stick around, although most others left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunny was not present, so Amber took charge of this meetup session.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/steel-city-ukuleles-2013-10-02.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;rubber-duckie&#34;&gt;Rubber Duckie&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed learning some new songs in the first half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One slightly crazy thing we tried was running through &amp;ldquo;Rubber Duckie&amp;rdquo;, which I had actually suggested to Sunny in email for the playlist for the next meetup, but apparently others had also suggested, for obvious reasons here in Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/n-kHSXQ_wwk&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This song is hard, with a lot of chord changes. I would like to actually master it and play it solo for Abby before Pittsburgh&amp;rsquo;s rubber duck leaves.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/steel-city-ukuleles-2013-10-02-rubber-duckie.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;rehearsal&#34;&gt;Rehearsal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rehearsal was intense, but we managed to cover the rest of the songs we are to play in the Ecofest gig three days (!!) from now. A lot of homework for me to do, just as I have been doing with the first half of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
