      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m always frustrated at this time of year because there are so many events of interest to me in Pittsburgh that seem to happen on the first weekend of October. Since I cannot attend all of them, I figured I might as well attempt a public service and mention some of them so that if you are in the Pittsburgh area, maybe you can go and enjoy what I can&amp;rsquo;t attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here are 9 of the probably dozens of cool things you could be doing tomorrow, Saturday, October 5, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;free-concert-allegheny-city-ragtime-orchestra&#34;&gt;Free concert: Allegheny City Ragtime Orchestra&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in ragtime or Latin music, check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shadysideacademy.org/page.cfm?p=12541&#34;&gt;this concert by the Allegheny City Ragtime Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some articles in anticipation of it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/ae/music/preview-ragtime-orchestra-connects-with-history-705929/&#34;&gt;Post-Gazette&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://triblive.com/aande/music/4763900-74/ragtime-music-concert&#34;&gt;Trib&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abby and I wanted to go, but finally decided that we have too many other activities earlier in the day and need to just stay home and unwind in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;free-conference-podcamp-pittsburgh-8&#34;&gt;Free conference: PodCamp Pittsburgh 8&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 8th annual &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.podcamppittsburgh.com/&#34;&gt;PodCamp Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt; should be good. If you have any interest in using social media for personal or professional purposes, you should check it out. Interesting talks, opportunities to just socialized and learn new things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I attended in 2010, 2011, 2012, and will attend again for the fourth year. Unfortunately, I will only be able to attend the afternoon sessions. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to completely miss it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that PodCamp completely changed my life. For example, &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/21/one-month-anniversary-of-my-blog/&#34;&gt;I started this blog in 2011 because of my second PodCamp&lt;/a&gt;, and I became serious about using social media in general, and that led to a total transformation of my life as I learned about local activities and made new friends. (Unfortunately, I didn&amp;rsquo;t get around to finishing my draft reports about my experience at last year&amp;rsquo;s PodCamp 7.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;pittsburgh-south-side-slopes-step-trek&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh South Side Slopes Step Trek&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The annual &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.southsideslopes.org/steptrek/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh South Side Slopes Step Trek&lt;/a&gt; is another event you can attend tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out my &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/08/my-god-its-full-of-stairs-pittsburgh-step-trek-2011/&#34;&gt;blog coverage two years ago&lt;/a&gt; as well as my &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/09/25/why-you-should-go-out-to-the-pittsburgh-south-side-slopes-step-trek/&#34;&gt;recent update&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Abby and I will be missing it this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;run-shadyside-5k&#34;&gt;Run Shadyside 5K&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like to run in races, a fine race is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.runshadyside.com/&#34;&gt;Run Shadyside 5K&lt;/a&gt;. Fast and flat, with a pancake breakfast and festivities afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not running in it this year, just because I have too many other things to do already for the rest of the day, but here&amp;rsquo;s my &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/01/run-shadyside-5k-outrunning-mickey-mouse-and-lending-a-trumpet/&#34;&gt;report from two years ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;free-5th-annual-wilkins-school-community-center-ecofest-in-regent-square&#34;&gt;Free: 5th annual Wilkins School Community Center Ecofest in Regent Square&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;5th annual Wilkins School Community Center Ecofest in Regent Square&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Interested in green living? Check out the &lt;a href=&#34;http://foresthills-regentsquare.patch.com/groups/around-town/p/ecofest-encourages-recycling-green-living&#34;&gt;5th annual Wilkins School Community Center Ecofest in Regent Square&lt;/a&gt;. Abby has regularly attended for the clothing swap. There will also be food, information, and entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that this year, I will also be attending, to perform as a new member of the Steel City Ukuleles. &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/08/23/another-unexpected-life-change-one-month-of-learning-to-play-ukulele/&#34;&gt;I just started playing the ukulele a bit over two months ago&lt;/a&gt;, and have been working hard to help put on an entertaining show!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll be performing around 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM. If you come, say hello!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cmu-donut-dash-2-mile-race&#34;&gt;CMU Donut Dash 2 mile race&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, if you are into weird running events, there is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://cmudonutdash.org/&#34;&gt;Carnegie Mellon University Donut Dash&lt;/a&gt;, a 2 mile event serving as a fundraiser for the Children&amp;rsquo;s Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC. This is not an event I have ever done, and not one I intend to do, but what the heck, some of you might love this sort of thing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;national-chess-day-gateway-open-tournament-at-the-pittsburgh-chess-club&#34;&gt;National Chess Day: Gateway Open tournament at the Pittsburgh Chess Club&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that it&amp;rsquo;s time for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nationalchessday.com/&#34;&gt;National Chess Day&lt;/a&gt;? There will be a tournament at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://pittsburghcc.org/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Chess Club&lt;/a&gt;, the 56th annual Gateway Open. Yes, chess in Pittsburgh has a long and illustrious history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;pittsburgh-perl-workshop&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Perl Workshop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a Perl programmer, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://pghpw.org/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Perl Workshop&lt;/a&gt; is back &lt;a href=&#34;http://pghpw.org/ppw2013/&#34;&gt;this year&lt;/a&gt;. Registration is already closed, so it&amp;rsquo;s not so helpful right now for me to mention it, but in case you didn&amp;rsquo;t know it existed, watch for it next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ninth-thing&#34;&gt;Ninth thing?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, I guess I miscounted. But there are a whole lot more than nine things to do in Pittsburgh tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you are interested in some free stuff to do, there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.radworkshere.org/interior.php?pageID=64&#34;&gt;RADical Days&lt;/a&gt; listing a whole bunch of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no shortage of stuff to do in this great city of Pittsburgh at any time or day of year. I think it&amp;rsquo;s unfortunate that many things I like to do happen to repeatedly fall on the first Saturday of the year, but I&amp;rsquo;m not complaining about an embarrassment of riches. Go out and take advantage of what I can&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why you should go out to the Pittsburgh South Side Slopes Step Trek</title>
      <link>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/09/25/why-you-should-go-out-to-the-pittsburgh-south-side-slopes-step-trek/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2013 21:37:56 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://franklinchen.com/blog/2013/09/25/why-you-should-go-out-to-the-pittsburgh-south-side-slopes-step-trek/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks to my &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/08/my-god-its-full-of-stairs-pittsburgh-step-trek-2011/&#34;&gt;blog coverage two years ago&lt;/a&gt; of the annual &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.southsideslopes.org/steptrek/&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Step Trek&lt;/a&gt;, I was invited, as I was last year also, by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.southsideslopes.org/&#34;&gt;South Side Slopes Neighborhood Association&lt;/a&gt; to a special preview small group tour of the &amp;ldquo;church route&amp;rdquo;, which includes 820 stairs (379 stairs up, 441 stairs down), led by Brian Oswald.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to attend for a couple of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To refresh my memory; I had not been to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Side_Slopes&#34;&gt;South Side Slopes&lt;/a&gt; for probably a year, since Abby and I entertained her visiting sister and her boyfriend by taking them on a tour ourselves, along with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.carrieplant.com/kitty/&#34;&gt;Kitty&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To take my work colleague John along and show him this unique part of Pittsburgh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To learn what is new with the maintenance of this unique neighborhood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To better promote the annual Step Trek event, which is enjoyable and benefits the neighborhood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my report on the evening preview tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;meeting-up&#34;&gt;Meeting up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John and I left straight from work to meet up with Brian at the entrance to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.southsideslopes.org/the-neighborhood/south-side-park/&#34;&gt;South Side Park&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of other people were supposed to attend, but it turned out only one of them made it, representing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.popcitymedia.com/&#34;&gt;Pop City&lt;/a&gt;. After waiting around for a while, we had to get going because of the danger of it getting dark before we would finish about an hour hike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;starting&#34;&gt;Starting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A last view back north toward the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Side_Flats&#34;&gt;South Side Flats&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-preview-2013/south-side-flats.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Looking north to South Side Flats&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We started immediately with a staircase underneath the Mission Street Bridge:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-preview-2013/mission-street-bridge.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Sample street on the route:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-preview-2013/street.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;guided-tour&#34;&gt;Guided tour&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way, Brian served as a tour guide, telling us all about renovations and repairs of various staircases, as well as particular ones that still needed work (such as a handrail that was broken). Two years ago, when Abby and I did the Step Trek event, we followed the nice booklet and route map that had a lot of historical information, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware of all the details of what people like Brian of the South Side Slopes Neighborhood Association do to find funding for neighborhood improvements and keep the staircases functional. It&amp;rsquo;s a challenge getting all the repairs done that are needed. That&amp;rsquo;s why the Step Trek is so important as a fundraiser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the tour, we encountered quite a few people who were using the staircases, including runners as well as walking residents who used them simply as the most practical or only way to get from one place to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;lighting&#34;&gt;Lighting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One improvement that Brian was particularly proud of showing us was an entire staircase with LED lighting installed, in order to make it particularly usable at night. It also helps against freezing in the winter. (Unfortunately, as we walked down, I forgot to take photos of the LED lights visible from going up.)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-preview-2013/leds.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-preview-2013/leds-view.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-preview-2013/leds-down.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-preview-2013/leds-down-more.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;alleys&#34;&gt;Alleys&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some alleys are actually public parts of the route!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-preview-2013/public-alleyways.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;churches&#34;&gt;Churches&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of churches on this route, hence &amp;ldquo;church route&amp;rdquo;. These are historical reminders of the early days of Pittsburgh with its ethnic churches all over.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-preview-2013/church.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;railroad&#34;&gt;Railroad&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking on a bridge over railroad tracks:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-preview-2013/railroad-tracks.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-preview-2013/railroad-bridge.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-steps&#34;&gt;More steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steps.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-preview-2013/steps-up.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-preview-2013/street-steps.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-preview-2013/street-steps-2.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-preview-2013/street-steps-3.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-preview-2013/street-steps-4.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-preview-2013/street-steps-5.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-preview-2013/street-steps-6.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-preview-2013/street-steps-7.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;st-paul-of-the-cross-monastery&#34;&gt;St. Paul of the Cross Monastery&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-preview-2013/monastery.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a nice view from the parking lot of the St. Paul of the Cross Monastery along the route (on Step Trek day you can enter). (Unfortunately, it was getting dark, so the photo is dark.)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-preview-2013/monastery-view.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;billy-buck-hill&#34;&gt;Billy Buck Hill&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of rather hilly roads in this neighborhood. A good workout!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-preview-2013/billy-buck-hill.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;views&#34;&gt;Views&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-preview-2013/view-down.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;south-side-park&#34;&gt;South Side Park&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian pointed out the successful planting of new trees as part of the improvement of South Side Park:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-preview-2013/trees.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We did not take the steps leading back through South Side Park, which are part of the official Step Trek route:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-preview-2013/south-side-park-steps.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Instead, we ventured into the woods. This way can be tricky because of the footing and possible mud, etc.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-preview-2013/south-side-park-woods.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The advantage is we could get to a field with a nice view:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-preview-2013/south-side-park-field.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;community-garden&#34;&gt;Community garden&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian showed us another great improvement to the neighborhood, a rather large &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.southsideslopes.org/the-neighborhood/community-garden/&#34;&gt;community garden&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-preview-2013/community-garden-above.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It was rapidly getting dark:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-preview-2013/dark-view.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We hurried to get back to where we had started, under the Mission Street Bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to Brian for leading this preview tour and answering our questions as we enjoyed a little hike with him through his neighborhood!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-improvements&#34;&gt;Other improvements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian told us about improvements to the Step Trek event itself. For one thing, they have an improved map booklet out, and also improved support for smartphones. These improvements are not just for the Step Trek event but will be usable for any visitors to the South Side Slopes neighborhood anytime, as well as a valuable reference for residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, the Step Trek also includes open houses, refreshment stops, and of course you can just hang out in the South Side Slopes checking out food and shopping too. The annual event is a great way to help the neighborhood and experience unique geography and get some exercise in also!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And at the entrance, there will be food trucks and entertainment, so that when you are done with however much hiking you want to do, you can hang out and relax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more on the Step Trek as experienced in daylight, review my &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/08/my-god-its-full-of-stairs-pittsburgh-step-trek-2011/&#34;&gt;blog coverage two years ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pittsburgh South Side Slopes is a unique historical neighborhood that you should check out, and what better way is there than to explore it on foot on Step Trek day?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was a beautiful, sunny, warm day, as promised earlier by the weather forecasts.  Abby and I did the 11th annual &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.southsideslopes.org/steptrek&#34;&gt;Pittsburgh Step Trek&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. I wish I&amp;rsquo;d known about this event in earlier years! It was a truly unique event, an urban hike of the Pittsburgh &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wqed.org/tv/sebak/neighborhoods/so_side.php&#34;&gt;South Side Slopes&lt;/a&gt;, with all its many staircases, zig-zagging streets, historic buildings, and great views of the city.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-stairs-down.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;?&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We did about six miles of fantastic sightseeing (and got a pretty good workout while at it):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived at the registration area in South Side Park, and immediately, people started asking about the &lt;a href=&#34;www.vibramfivefingers.com/&#34;&gt;Vibram FiveFingers&lt;/a&gt; shoes that Abby and I were wearing: Abby was wearing her &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/products/Five-Fingers-Sprint-Womens.htm&#34;&gt;Sprint&lt;/a&gt; and I was wearing my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/products/Five-Fingers-KSO-Mens.htm&#34;&gt;KSO&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout the Step Trek we would get asked about them by many other curious trekkers! We always got the same kinds of questions: &amp;ldquo;Are they comfortable?&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Do they provide enough protection/support?&amp;rdquo; The answer is yes, they are pretty comfortable, and yes, they are sufficiently protective and supportive, if you learn to walk more carefully, and develop your foot and leg muscles; and there are different models we use for different terrains and activities.  For example, I have mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/09/23/happiness-is-finishing-39th-of-43-men-in-a-race/&#34;&gt;in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/09/25/blistered-but-blissful-in-the-burgh/&#34;&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2011/10/01/run-shadyside-5k-outrunning-mickey-mouse-and-lending-a-trumpet/&#34;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; my running on the roads in Bikila LS, and running and hiking off road in KSO Trek shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we checked in with our tickets (pre-registered earlier) and were given a booklet for the self-guided tour for the Step Trek, we started our trek. There were two looping routes outlined, the Black route (3.02 miles, with 1,250 steps) and the Gold route (2.89 miles, with 1,222 steps). We decided to do one route first and then the other immediately following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started off with the Gold route, entering South Side Park and immediately taking the 72 serpentine steps up.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;photos&#34;&gt;Photos&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is just a minuscule sample of what else we saw. You&amp;rsquo;d have to do the Step Trek to experience it yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a nice view of Pittsburgh during the trek:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-view-of-pittsburgh.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Nice view of Pittsburgh&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s another one:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-view-of-pittsburgh-2.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Another nice view of Pittsburgh&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_street&#34;&gt;paper street&lt;/a&gt;, Caesar Way, which is actually a staircase rather than an actual street! Pittsburgh has a number of these I have encountered before.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-caesar-way.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Caesar Way (paper street)&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A typical staircase leading connecting areas of different elevation:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-some-steps.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;A staircase&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A beautiful view while descending on a road. The old St. Josaphat church is visible down the road:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-descent.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Descent on road&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the bi-level streets we saw, with fencing separating the two levels:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;One of the bi-level streets&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Me just enjoying a little break at the Eleanor Street parklet:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../../images/step-trek-franklin-swing.jpg&#34; /&gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Franklin on swing at the Eleanor Street parklet&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;done&#34;&gt;Done&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we returned from finishing both the Gold and Black routes, we enjoyed watermelon slices, oranges, and bananas. Because it was so sunny, we were both slightly sunburned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier, we enjoyed the official rest stops that provided beverages, bite-sized candy bars, and port-a-johns. A very nicely organized event, with clear signs posted periodically along the routes and friendly crossing guards at fast-moving roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing we particular enjoyed after finishing was looking at the gallery of historic photos in one of the tents. It was eerie seeing those black and white photos of streets we had walked that were once dirt roads for horses, construction of bridges and staircases, old homes that are still standing now (and renovated). I wish there were more of the before/after photos. Maybe decades from now we&amp;rsquo;ll see YouTube time-lapse videos of how things are now in our neighborhoods and how things will be then!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-of-2012-10-06&#34;&gt;(Update of 2012-10-06)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following year, sadly, I did not do the Pittsburgh Step Trek again, because of a schedule conflict with &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2012/10/06/the-fineview-stepathon-2012-pittsburghs-grueling-urban-trail-race/&#34;&gt;the Fineview Stepathon that I did instead&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;ll have to see what the schedules are for 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-of-2013-9-25&#34;&gt;(Update of 2013-9-25)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, because of schedule conflicts again, Abby and I will not able to attend Step Trek. It seems that everything in Pittsburgh happens on the weekend of Step Trek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I attended a special preview tour that enabled me to &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2013/09/25/why-you-should-go-out-to-the-pittsburgh-south-side-slopes-step-trek/&#34;&gt;catch up on changes and also promote the event&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
