[Just earlier this week, I went to a music jam where I was afraid to play](/blog/2012/07/03/petrified-at-a-music-jam-session-so-i-didnt-play-but-watched-and-listened) and so I didn't.

Today Abby and I went to another intimidating potluck/jam session, this time hosted by [Mimi Jong](http://www.appalasia.com/Mimi.htm) and [Susan Wagner](http://classic-sculpture.com/). Mimi had invited Abby, but hadn't yet met me; I knew who she was through having been to an [Appalasia](http://www.appalasia.com/) performance with Abby at some point earlier.

This time I played a little bit. I almost didn't, but felt that I had to start with something.

## Lots of music

There was music going on outside in back of the home. Wow. It was fantastic stuff, what everyone was doing.

There was Mimi on [erhu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhu), of course. There was a keyboard and sound system set up. People on bass, guitars, drums of all kinds, claves, banjos, violin, singing, you name it. All kinds of music was being jammed to. A lot of Latin music, sung by someone who seemed a native Spanish speaker.

I recognized a violinist as being someone who had played Baroque violin at a recital I had been at in April.

In any case, there were clearly a lot of professional musicians here and so I felt really intimidated. I did a lot of watching and listening and quite enjoyed experiencing joy and inventiveness unfold.

It was fascinating seeing Mimi kicking off ["Summertime"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summertime_(song)) on erhu. Hey, why not?

Some of the Latin and Brazilian songs I knew the melodies for, and if I only knew all lyrics and could actually sing, I would have wanted to join in for.

## Joining in

But Mimi encouraged Abby and me to join in. At some point, Abby did join in.

Part of the problem for me, besides the fact that I felt naked and helpless without a music score to read, was that I'd brought one case of instruments this time, which included some recorders as well as a Baroque flute, and it didn't seem like any of these instruments was really suitable for the occasion. In my hurry to arrive at the potluck already running late, I had forgotten to bring my modern flute!

I did the best I could and took out my Baroque flute and tried joining in. Some old time music came on and I found it not so difficult to do something for that, although nothing I was proud of.

What I remember mainly is when Mimi started some blues and at some point I came in and gave it a shot, and although I didn't last very long, I got something in that wasn't totally horrible. Somehow that was very liberating, getting those few seconds in for the evening. At least I didn't walk away from the party this evening without playing anything at all.

## Conclusion

Attending this potluck/jam session was an immensely exciting experience for me. I feel like I am truly expanding my musical world, and getting inspired. I too would like to be singing my favorite Latin songs. And I really like blues improvisation. I will start doing these things eventually; they are no longer just remote possibilities, but what I have seen people doing in front of my own eyes and not in an impersonal concert but at a casual, fun party.
