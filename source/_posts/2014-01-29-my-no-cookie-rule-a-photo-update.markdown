Two weeks ago [I vowed never to eat a cookie again, unless I took a photo of it and posted it](/blog/2014/01/16/a-system-for-quitting-eating-cookies/).

I was at a party tonight, and originally saw no cookies, so I thought I was safe.

I was wrong. After hours of eating a lot of pretty good food, I saw that cookies were brought out and place next to the coffee in back. I paused, remembering my promise, but then thought, "what the heck", and "carefully" chose just two cookies, photographed them, and ate them.

## Consequences

My first observation was that it was actually not so easy to choose two cookies to take. Visually, on close inspection, I did not actually believe that any of the cookies were really going to be so tasty. In fact, the more deliberate I was, the more I visualized that these things as assembled sugar, fat, and wheat bombs serving no useful purpose for my body.

I could have just stopped there, and chosen not to take any cookies, but habit or curiosity caused me to take two anyway.

It turned out that I didn't really enjoy the cookies. They weren't so good. Also, they seemed much bigger when I started eating them, in that I had enough and wanted to stop but felt like I should finish what I started.

Then I proceeded to feel bloated and sleepy. I went home really thinking about the stupid thing that I did, and the fact that I was going to have to write about my experience.

## Future

I suspect that I will eventually break my habit of eating cookies at social occasions where they present themselves. I had a really bad experience tonight. Because I documented it, I will remember it.
