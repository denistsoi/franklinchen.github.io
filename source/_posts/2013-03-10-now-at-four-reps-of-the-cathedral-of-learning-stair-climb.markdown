Today I joined a Team Ferlee group stair climb workout at the Cathedral of Learning for the second time. [Two weeks ago](/blog/2013/02/24/finally-doing-the-cathedral-of-learning-stair-climb-as-part-of-team-ferlee/) I did two reps and ten floors total.

I am still in recovery from doing yesterday a really tough 12 mile Steel City Road Runners training run for the Pittsburgh Marathon, so I didn't know what exactly I planned to do.

It turned out that thanks to Bill, with whom I finally climbed for the first time today, I did more than I had originally intended. In retrospect, I probably shouldn't have, but I did, so what's done is done.

Here's what happened.

## The workout

The team did the first two reps sort of together, which meant not very fast for Bill or me. That was fine. I like socializing and going easy to warm up.

On the third rep, Bill decided he wanted to do a fast one, so he timed himself. I tried to follow him, but in my depleted condition had no plan to kill myself to overtake him. I just wanted to test an honest genuinely fast, but not all out, third rep.

He ended up doing the third rep in 7:26, his new personal record. I did not time myself, but finished probably about ten seconds behind him, I gathered, so I did around 7:36. This was clearly the fastest I've also done one rep of the stair climb, not that I've been timing myself much in the past months (check out [my reports from two months ago](/blog/2013/01/19/why-ive-chosen-to-perform-only-two-repetitions-of-the-cathedral-of-learning-stair-climb/), when I timed myself just to get an idea of my baseline).

## My fourth rep

Everyone was done after the third rep, but I decided to hang around to do one last rep by myself, since I felt strangely OK even after the hard third rep; recovery from that seemed rather quick. The marathon training I've been doing has clearly helped with my endurance for stair climbing as well.

So I did an untimed fourth rep just because I could.

## Conclusion

Having done four reps with good form is starting to give me confidence that in two weeks, I'll be able to put in a good all-out effort in the Fight for Air Climb.
