Round 5 of the annual [Pittsburgh Chess Club](http://pittsburghcc.org/) Championship involved a very unusual (for me) situation: being surprised at move 4 out of the opening! (Amusingly, Kurt was taking a bunch of photos at the time and happened to get a photo of me being surprised, and later sent it to me.)

I coped well and played what I thought to be perhaps my cleanest game yet in this tournament.

I report on the psychology of how to deal with opening surprises, and other turning points in the game.

## Preparation

As I [mentioned after last week's game](/blog/2013/02/05/pittsburgh-chess-club-championship-2013-round-4-fascinating-attacking-defending-game/), for this week I was paired against Expert Richard Edahl, whom I had never played against before, so I had nothing special prepared against him.

Furthermore, on the day of the game, I was occupied with a personal emergency that had me taking the day off work and not knowing for sure whether I was going to even make it to the game. I managed to get done what I needed to do and arrive at the club for the game.

## Overview of my game

### The opening

Richard as Black played the first moves in the opening very quickly, then spent two minutes on his fourth move, playing a move, `e5`, that I had *never* seen before or considered in this opening, and rose and walked away from the board:

So what should one do when encountering a totally unexpected move in the opening? There are only a few possible explanations for an unexpected move:

- it is a known good move, and I just have a bad memory or incomplete theoretical study of the opening
- it is a theoretical novelty that improves on previous play
- it is a bad move, and that's why I have never seen it before

In this case, since the "new" move was at move 4, not deep in some obscure variation, I was sure that the move was a *bad* one. So then the question was, how to *punish* it? I spent 16 minutes calculating a whole series of lines in depth until I convinced myself of why the move was bad and how I could prove it no matter what my opponent's followup moves.

#### Does Black lose a Pawn?

The first thing to note is that Black does not lose the unprotected `e5` Pawn to `Nxe5`, because there is, at least, the discovered attack `Nxe4` that regains the Pawn. However, just because Black regains a Pawn does not mean that the position is then equal. I quickly concluded that if Black played `Nxe4`, I could force Black to accept a clearly inferior position by blocking up his Bishop and weakening his King side. (This is in fact what happened in the game.)

However, I had to consider the possibility that Black could try to regain the Pawn a different way, with `Qe7`. Here, I had to find out why this move *had* to be bad (given my assumption that `e5` in the first place was bad). Surely, if Black can regain the Pawn by chasing White's Knight away, the position would be equal?

It took a while for me to find and verify the refutation of `Qe7`, which in fact does *not* regain the Pawn. The trick is the sacrificial pin `Bg5` threatening `Nd5`:

So I offer this as an example of thinking a long time about a possible game continuation that did *not* take place, but *could have*, and therefore had to be considered.

#### The game continuation

After Black played `Nxe4`, I forced the following position, clearly favorable to White:

What next? I decided to keep my options open and possibly aim to attack on the King side. Things were helped when my opponent moved his Queen away from the King side:

### The middlegame

At this point, I had a choice: either safely castle King side with a huge positional advantage in the center and in development, or continue my King side attack plan, while setting a diabolical trap. I opted to set the trap with `h4`; my opponent fell into the trap by playing `h5`, after which my `Nd5` won a Pawn, at the cost of a Queen trade and my giving up a Bishop for a Knight:

### The endgame

After I grabbed the Pawn on `c7`, we arrived at this position:

{% img /chess/chen-edahl-2013-02-12_files/diag3F9217CA48E58BC1.gif White a Pawn up %}

Then after some inaccurate play by Black, we arrived at an important position:

Here, `Nd5` was best, but instead I passively defended against `Bd3+` with `R1c3`, after which Black could have played actively with `Ba5` and caused trouble, equalizing into a drawn position. Instead, he immediately lost with `Rd7??`, which fell victim to `Be5+` followed by `Nd5` winning an exchange:

Black could have resigned, but did not; the rest of the game was anticlimactic, with Black blundering further and hanging a piece on `h4` and immediately resigning:

## Lessons learned from my game

- Do not panic when surprised in the opening; if you have prepared well, chances are the surprising move is a bad one, so just calculate out why it is bad.
- Even in a completely winning position, one small passive move could lead to the losing side having enough active counterplay to equalize.

## What next?

So after round 5, I am leading the tournament by an entire point, with a score of 5.0/6.0 going into round 6, and nobody else having 5.0 or even 4.5 points. This means that *no matter what happens in round 6*, I am already tied for first for the title of Pittsburgh Chess Club Champion of 2013. I could lose and tie for first; if I draw or win, I get clear first, no tie.

For round 6, I am paired against Kurt Wallnau, [who won a game against me in the last Tuesday night tournament](/blog/2012/12/11/round-5-of-pittsburgh-chess-club-tournament-psychology-of-losing-another-won-game/). I get Black again.

There will be some interesting psychology for our game, because [just as in the last tournament, he needs to win in order to tie for first place](/blog/2013/01/15/how-the-best-player-won-the-last-pittsburgh-chess-club-tuesday-night-tournament/): a draw leaves me the sole champion.

Needless to say, I am playing in round 6 for the *win*, not for the *draw*. Although I would be very happy to become the clear Pittsburgh Chess Club Champion, prizes and titles don't actually mean that much to me. My goal remains to play the best chess I can: a correct and creative game.

As a corollary, of course, if I manage to do that, I should also *as a side effect* totally *destroy and crush* my opponent, which also happens to be fun, I have to confess. There's no way to euphemize this fundamentally warlike nature of chess. I'm a bit uneasy about it, but part of me enjoys releasing my aggression through chess. Check out this interview with current world number one Magnus Carlsen:

Click in the video to 4:10, where he answers the interview question, "But you enjoy it when you see you opponents squirm?" He answers candidly, for all of us serious chess players:

{% blockquote %}
Yes, I do. I enjoy it when I see my opponent, you know, really suffering, when he knows that I've outsmarted him. If I lose just one game, then usually, you know, I just really want to [gestures violently and angrily] get revenge.
{% endblockquote %}

I can't deny this part of chess. I lost to Kurt in the last tournament, so what can I say? I'm itching to win.

## Conclusion

I enjoyed thinking for myself, outside of "book", after move 4 in the opening in this game. I feel like I've been playing reasonably well in this tournament, and hope to conclude it with a good game next week.
