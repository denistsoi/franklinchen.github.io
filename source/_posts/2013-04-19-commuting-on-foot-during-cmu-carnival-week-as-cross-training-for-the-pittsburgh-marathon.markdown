Last year, I reported on deciding to [walk to work and back home during CMU Carnival week in order to avoid the hassles of parking on campus](/blog/2012/04/16/one-week-of-commuting-on-foot-because-of-cmu-carnival/). This year, I decided to do this again, but with a twist.

I considered my commute to be a deliberate part of cross-training for the Pittsburgh Marathon.

## Why walk instead of run?

You might think that I would just run to work and back home, but the logistics were too complicated because of clothing, laptop, and other issues. I ran in to work this week just one time; otherwise, I walked.

More important, I feel that walking is greatly underrated as a fitness activity. Here is one of many recent articles, for example, reporting that [walking has many underrated health benefits](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/04/study-walking-can-be-as-good-as-running/274738/). Unfortunately, I think the tone of this article is part of the problem: the title is "Study: walking can be as good as running", which is just sensationalist drivel. I don't see walking and running as competitors at all. They are just two different activities, with different benefits, really. High-intensity running, for example, does a lot that walking does not do. But walking is less stressful, is slower, takes more time to cover a particular distance, is more meditative and in many cases more sociable (since running paces differ more than walking paces). Both are great.

## Total mileage

I ended up walking about 12 miles total more than I normally walk during the week. Note that this is less than the total of the distances between home and office because when I drive in to work, I have to walk the distance between the parking lot and the office.

## Footwear: concerns over the Luna Sandals

I took the opportunity to put more mileage onto my Luna Sandals, which I've been wearing for all my running in recent weeks. I figured that the more time I spend on these minimalist sandals, the more prepared I will be for the sustained impact of running the whole Pittsburgh Marathon in them. Also, I needed more time to get used to the lacing system.

It turned out that the extra 12 miles on my feet really made a difference in how much more stress on my feet I felt during this training week: not just soreness in my soles, but also some issues with drying, cracking skin.

### Cushioned shoes

After yesterday, I decided I needed a break from all the walking, and so on Friday, I drove to work, parking on Circuit Road, and walking less than half a mile to my office from there, and in my [Rockport Westshire casual shoes](http://www.amazon.com/Rockport-Mens-Westshire-Oxford-Black/dp/B000VRUX54) rather than any minimalist shoes! I did this especially because of the [Random Distance Run I did in my Luna Sandals](/blog/2013/04/19/going-out-too-fast-yet-again-in-my-third-random-distance-run/).

### The Mono

I also finally decided to order a pair of thicker Luna Sandals, the new [Mono](http://www.lunasandals.com/products/37-mono), which are 12 mm thick rather than the 7 mm of the Venado I'm currently wearing:

There's a review of these huaraches on [Birthday Shoes](http://birthdayshoes.com/luna-mono-huaraches-barefoot-sandals-review). I will almost certainly *not* be receiving these huaraches in time to break in and use in the Pittsburgh Marathon, but I expect to use them this summer for walking around in and longer runs.

## Conclusion

It was unexpected to me how much more fat burning and soreness for my feet the extra 12 miles of walking this week gave me. I had to eat more just to maintain my weight, and I was so ready to take a break from minimalist shoes. I did decide to order a thicker running sandal for future running and walking.
