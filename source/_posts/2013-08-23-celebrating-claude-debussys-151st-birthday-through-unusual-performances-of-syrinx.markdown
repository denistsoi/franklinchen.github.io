There was [much ado](http://jessicamusic.blogspot.com/2013/08/stop-dumbing-down-debussy.html) over Google's "celebrating" Claude Debussy's 151st birthday through a ["Claire de Lune" doodle](http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/08/22/claude_debussy_google_doodles_claire_de_lune_for_composer_s_151st_birthday.html).

It turns out that I do totally love this piece of music, but it may well be true that many people do not know much about a lot of the other great music he wrote.

## Syrinx

Anyway, I decided to celebrate the birthday in my own way. I chose Debussy's famous work for solo flute, [Syrinx](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrinx_%28Debussy%29), as a starting point.

Two years ago, I already linked to a fine performance of it on flute [by Emmannuel Pahud](/blog/2011/11/22/james-galway-made-me-hate-flute/). There are many other good performances on flute, but inspired by [Emily O'Brien](http://emilysdomain.org/)'s [performance that I attended last year of Syrinx on tenor recorder](/blog/2012/07/21/mideast-early-music-workshop-a-life-changing-experience/), I looked for other non-flute performances of this music.

I found two intriguing ones to share.

### Tenor recorder

One is another tenor recorder performance, by Kenjiro Hibi. This Japanese musician made it seem as though it were traditional Japanese shakuhachi music!

### Trumpet

Then I found this amazing performance on trumpet, by [Alison Balsom](http://alisonbalsom.com/).

I found this through [someone else's blog post on Syrinx for Debussy's birthday](http://musicalassumptions.blogspot.com/2013/08/the-many-faces-of-syrinx-for-debussys.html)!

## More on Syrinx

Here is some interesting discussion of [interpretation and editions](http://www.flutefocus.com/232-syrinx-by-debussy.html).

At some point, of course, I must work on this piece and play it on flute. But not yet.

## Conclusion

I have a fascination with music played in a context other than the original, such as on a different instrument. It was fun discovering some performances of Debussy's Syrinx on recorder and trumpet.
