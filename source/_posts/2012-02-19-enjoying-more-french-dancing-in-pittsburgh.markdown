A month ago I reported on the [first experience of French traditional dance of Abby and me](http://franklinchen.com/blog/2012/01/23/discovering-french-traditional-dance-in-pittsburgh). On Saturday we went again to Skibo Gym at Carnegie Mellon University for another fun session of French dancing from 4:00 to 7:00 PM.

It was again a lot of fun. There were many new people we hadn't met before, and I got my office mate John to go too. Abby and I learned some dances that were not taught the last time, and we got to do more of the dances we had learned the last time.
