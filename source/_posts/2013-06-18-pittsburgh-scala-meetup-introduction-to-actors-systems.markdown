Josh Suereth spoke again at the latest [Pittsburgh Scala Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Scala-Meetup/) [event](http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Scala-Meetup/events/123884682/).

He gave an introduction to actors using [Akka](http://akka.io/). I'd attended a version of his introductory talk over a year ago, actually, when he gave it at the [first Pittsburgh TechFest](/blog/2012/06/09/report-on-the-first-pittsburgh-techfest-2012/), so it was basically review for me.

However, the discussion during the presentation and afterwards was what the meetup was really about, and I found that really useful.

Sadly, I still have not yet written a real actor-based software system yet.
