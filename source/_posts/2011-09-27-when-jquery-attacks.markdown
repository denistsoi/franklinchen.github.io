It's Tuesday night. After spending the day at work testing and debugging a new feature for a [Java](http://java.com/) program of mine that parses and transforms data using [ANTLR](http://antlr.org/), what do I have to look forward to?

Apparently, the answer must be that I look forward to a *hellish* 30 minute drive at 6:30 PM in the opposite direction of home (which is only two miles away), taking a planned detour to avoid an insane [I-579 construction-caused backup](http://www.dot.state.pa.us/PENNDOT/Districts/district11.nsf/befa2937349a7160852570a70047899a/1cf78bf5840af8b8852578c5006741a3?OpenDocument), then weaving through a horrible [*McKnightmare* construction zone](http://northhills.patch.com/articles/mcknight-road-construction-creates-headache-for-many), in order to meet up with a handful of fellow [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) geeks, for another hour or so of more staring at computer code!

The title "When [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) attacks" is actually not mine, but stolen from the title of today's session by [Steven Brownlee](http://www.fusioncube.net/), the gracious founder and host at [Smith Micro](http://www.smithmicro.com/) of the [Pittsburgh JavaScript meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-JavaScript-Developers/).

Around eight or nine of us showed up tonight, and shared pizza Steve had ordered for us.

Steve briefly presented an overview of basic jQuery features, then we all just informally chatted about various topics that we brought up, from the coming impact of [HTML5](http://www.html5rocks.com/), the rise of JavaScript and its future, the decline of such technologies as Flash and JBoss, different JavaScript engines such as [v8](http://code.google.com/p/v8/) and [Rhino](http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/), client-side vs. server-side use of JavaScript (especially [Node](http://nodejs.org/), which we have had meetups about already), and the controversy over Google's [Dart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Dart).

## My own use of JavaScript

I have to confess that although I have used jQuery to prototype a web application I am developing, I have become uncomfortable with using just jQuery and adding layers on top of it using jQuery's own bare-bones systems for [templates](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.template/) and [data binding](http://api.jquery.com/link/) to cleanly structure the application rather than have it be a horrible tangled-spaghetti mess of DOM hacking.

I am currently evaluating full-blown [MVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller) types of frameworks such as [Backbone](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone) and [Sproutcore](http://www.sproutcore.com/) and [Sencha Ext JS 4](http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/). Stay tuned for my investigations of all that on this blog sometime.
