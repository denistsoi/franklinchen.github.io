One thing interesting about having been writing in my blog for [just over a year now](/blog/2012/09/22/celebrating-this-blogs-one-year-anniversary/) is the opportunity to look back one year and compare where I was then with where I am now when it comes to seasonal activities and goals.

For example, today I was originally planning to run in the [CMU intramural](http://athletics.cmu.edu/intramurals/index) men's XC race this year, as [I had enjoyed doing it last year](/blog/2011/09/23/happiness-is-finishing-39th-of-43-men-in-a-race/).

I ended up not running it for a couple of reasons.

- I've been barely running since the [Pretty Good Race 5K](/blog/2012/09/07/running-my-8th-pretty-good-race-5k-dealing-with-disappointment/) and therefore untrained, and probably likely to finish dead last, given the very few number of guys preregistered.
- It was raining pretty hard, making unpleasant the thought of running outside on the grass and mud.
- I was feeling OK yesterday, but today was feeling unusually tired and almost sick, and I'm still trying to determine whether to run the Great Race on Sunday [for the tenth time as planned](/blog/2011/09/25/blistered-but-blissful-in-the-burgh/).

Some interesting observations:

- If I had not been feeling sick, I think there was a 30% chance I would have run anyway.
- If I had not been feeling sick, and it had not been raining, there was a 95% chance I would have run anyway (my only fear being forgetting the course and losing contact with the second-to-last place guy).

## Conclusion

Having a long-running blog enables me to remember what I did and what I hoped to do the following year, and compare.

This year, I didn't manage to do what I planned a year ago. Well, there's always next year.
