I decided last night, after eating too many cookies at the [Steel City Ukuleles meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Steel-City-Ukuleles/events/154668232/), that I have to stop eating cookies. I cannot justify them on the grounds of health (and how crappy I sometimes feel after eating them).

My "creative" idea that I shared with Abby: I will never eat a cookie again in my life unless I take a photo of it.

In other words, the cookie has somehow appeal to me so much that I bother to pause, *deliberately* take a photo, and risk social embarrassment (and better yet, explain my system to people so they know I'm not supposed to eat cookies).

Also, I must post publicly any cookie that I eat.

We'll see how well this system works. I can sense cookie opportunities coming up already!
