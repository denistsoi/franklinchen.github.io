It's been over a week since my last Cathedral of Learning stair climb, [which I did with other members of Team Ferlee](/blog/2013/02/24/finally-doing-the-cathedral-of-learning-stair-climb-as-part-of-team-ferlee/). Apart from being very busy generally, I've been focusing on getting my Pittsburgh Marathon training going.

But today after work I had some time to squeeze in a stair climb workout. I ended up finally going to *three* full reps! The reason I felt ready to do this was that I have started to find it easier to recover from two reps, and also I have found ways to reduce my boredom, by really getting deep into monitoring the physical sensations of stair climbing: not only the details of efficiently lifting my leg and pushing up, but also even how to make turns effectively. I appreciate the subtleties of stair climbing much more than I did when I started out. So I am now mentally prepared to do more than two reps.

## My times

- 9:09, then 4:13 recovery
- 9:12, then 3:26 recovery
- 8:52

I was very conservative in going slower than usual and taking a fairly long recovery, but my goal was to get in three solid reps, with the final rep being fastest. Also, [having just run a 5K race yesterday](/blog/2013/03/03/my-first-steel-city-road-runners-winter-5k-race/), technically today was supposed to be an "easy" workout day.

## Conclusion

Doing three reps of the Cathedral stair climb wasn't too bad. I can see myself doing the reps faster and with less recovery time in the future.
