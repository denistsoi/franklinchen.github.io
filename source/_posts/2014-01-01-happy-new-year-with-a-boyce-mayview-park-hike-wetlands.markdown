Happy New Year 2014!

Abby and I started off this new year with a lovely [hike with the Pittsburgh hiking meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/pittsburghhikers/events/157809022), led by Gary Byrdman. It was in Boyce-Mayview Park, a park we'd never been to before [in Upper St. Clair](http://www.twpusc.org/rec-leisure/parks-fields).

It was a beautiful day, not too cold, and mostly not too muddy or icy either, thankfully. Abby and I did each use a pair of hiking poles, and many of us used [MICROSpikes](http://kahtoola.com/product/microspikes/) or [Yaktrax](http://www.yaktrax.com/) also during the hike, but it turned out that the spikes were actually something of a hassle because snow accumulated under them for people. If it had been more icy out, I would have used spikes, however.

I wore my relatively new minimalist New Balance trail running shoes for this hike.

The hike lasted about two and a half hours.

We had a great group of people, and Gary even brought breakfast to share with us. After the hike, I eagerly sampled his treats. What a guy! During the hike, he pointed out interesting features, such as beaver dams, woodpecker holes (and we heard woodpeckers too), places that are great for birding in the spring, and a nice waterfall that was partially iced but running.

If you're a member of the [Pittsburgh hiking meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/pittsburghhikers), you have access to the event page and the [photo page for the hike](http://www.meetup.com/pittsburghhikers/photos/19309272/), where I uploaded a couple dozen photos.

I'm posting just a few here, to whet your appetite for this park. There was such varied terrain and so much to see!

## Conclusion

Abby and I really enjoyed this hike. We promised ourselves that we would return to it next spring and summer. There's clearly so much to enjoy and explore in Boyce-Mayview Pakr.

If you want to check it out yourself, the Pittsburgh Meetup group often has hikes in this park.

I love living in Western Pennsylvania. There is so much to see around here. I will never get bored here. I feel blessed to be living here in Pittsburgh.
