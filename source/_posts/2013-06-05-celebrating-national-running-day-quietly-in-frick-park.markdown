Last year, I made something of a [big deal](/blog/2012/06/06/i-celebrated-national-running-day-in-schenley-park-remembering-how-i-began-to-run-13-year-ago/) of celebrating [National Running Day](http://www.runningday.org/) in [Schenley Park](http://www.pittsburghparks.org/schenley) in Pittsburgh, for sentimental reasons. This year, I celebrated more quietly, by simply running one of my standard easy runs, a 5-mile run in [Frick Park](http://pittsburghparks.org/frick).

I have nothing to say, other than I'm happy to be out there running.

## Luna Mono Sandals

I wore my [Luna Mono Sandals](http://www.lunasandals.com/products/luna-mono), which is much thicker (12mm) than the [Luna Venado Sandals](http://www.lunasandals.com/products/luna-venado) (7mm) that I wore a lot last year. The Mono's thickness makes it feel much different from the Venado: welcome cushioning, but at the expense of ground feel and flexibility. It's all about tradeoffs.
