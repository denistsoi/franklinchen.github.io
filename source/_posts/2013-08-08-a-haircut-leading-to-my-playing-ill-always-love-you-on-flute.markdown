I got a haircut from my barber Joe, whom I have been seeing [for sixteen years now](/blog/2011/10/29/my-favorite-barber/) since moving to Pittsburgh. Unexpectedly, this led me to "discovering" a piece of music and going home to play it on flute.

I was happy to arrive with only one other person in line, just getting into the chair, because Joe has a policy of not taking reservations, and "if you leave, you lose your turn":

In practice, Joe usually takes 20-25 minutes per person, I figured on being out within 50 minutes. Since I was pretty exhausted because of a tough week, I took the opportunity to do some napping. In practice, I don't really sleep, but do get rest. Since Joe always has his oldies radio station on, I try to enjoy the music (which is not the kind of music I ordinarily listen to these days) and identify songs and singers I recognize.

## Music

I heard someone sing a song that I recognized but had never truly known. I think it's a beautiful song, actually (from a melodic and harmonic point of view), although horribly cheesy if you pay attention to the lyrics.

I recognized the song as being in ["I Used to Play Flute"](/blog/2012/03/17/st-patricks-day-party-playing-tin-whistle-and-flute/), although I did not remember the title. I did remember really enjoying playing it on flute.

So this evening, after dinner, I found the song in the book. It's called ["I'll Always Love You"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27ll_Always_Love_You_%28Taylor_Dayne_song%29). I played through the song with the CD track accompaniment.

I also looked for a sung performance on YouTube, and found one, by the musician who actually created it in 1987, [Taylor Dayne](http://www.taylordayne.com/):

I don't think this this is who I heard on Joe's radio station. Taylor Dayne sings more wildly than whoever was on the radio (or maybe in my half-asleep state, I wasn't paying enough attention). This is not the kind of music I was listening to in 1988, and I have to confess I cringed when watching this video, because although the performance is quite good, her style of singing is just not really to my taste! I prefer the song as an instrumental.

### Tito Nieves

I was very amused to find a [salsa cover of this song](http://www.jukebo.com/tito-nieves/music-clip,i-ll-always-love-you,u8quz.html) by [Tito Nieves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tito_Nieves). It's pretty good, actually:

## Haircut photos

In any case, I was delighted not only to have gotten a haircut, but also learned something about a piece of music that had up till now only been a CD track and a flute part that I had played through months ago.
