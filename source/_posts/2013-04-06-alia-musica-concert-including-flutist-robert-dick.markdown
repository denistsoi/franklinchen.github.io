Abby and I attended [Alia Musica](http://www.alia-musica.org/)'s [spring concert](http://www.facebook.com/events/457110391031166/), featuring older as well as brand new music. [Robert Dick](http://www.robertdick.net/) made an appearance to repeat his famous composition, [Meristem], which had played in his [solo recital also](/blog/2013/04/04/energetic-robert-dick-solo-flute-recital-in-pittsburgh-with-alia-musica/).

[Henry Doktorski](http://www.henrydoktorski.com/) played [two pieces in this program with Alia Music as accordionist](http://www.henrydoktorski.com/misc/aliamusica.html).

And so Robert Dick's Pittsburgh tour came to an end. What a week it's been!

## (Update of 2014-01-16)

This is an unfinished post that is one of many in the past two years that lay unfinished because I had originally planned to write a very detailed report but never got around to it. I decided that I might as well release all these unfinished posts rather than leave them completely out of the record.
