Abby and I went to a French dance potluck party hosted by Lisa that included a special dance workshop on "Congo de Captieux" taught by her and a visitor, Lynn. This is a set dance for groups of four dancers (two couples) that really moves along and gets you sweaty! Here is a sample of what it looks like (*not* of us):

We haven't been doing French dance or music lately because of lots of things going on (including Abby's breaking her foot in February; she can finally do a bit of dancing again), so it was good to be back.

The dance was pretty complex to learn, but it was fun to finally be able to get through the steps, because the coordinating the interleaving continuous motion was strangely satisfying and thrilling!
