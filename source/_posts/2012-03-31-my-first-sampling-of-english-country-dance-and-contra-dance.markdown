By "accident", today I participated in my first sampling of both [English country dance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_country_dance) and [contra dance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_dance). Abby and I went to a large birthday celebration in which many of the guests were musicians and dancers, and hence there was live music performed by friends and someone who taught and called dances.

I hadn't intended to participate, despite [having the idea of trying contra dance planted in my head three months ago](/blog/2011/12/11/learning-another-instrument-the-tin-whistle/), but out of a sense of etiquette and opportunity, did participate in a couple of the "easier" dances.

## Confusion

As I expected, I was totally confused. It was hard for me to remember what was what, turning in a circle, moving down the line with a partner, rotating around, switching places, all that stuff. The instruction went by way too fast for me. Afterwards, I could remember very little of anything that I did.

## Benefits

However, I left the party being far less "afraid" of English country dance and contra dance. I muddled through just enough that I *knew* that if I applied myself, I could get it, and maybe even enjoy it. It is often hard to know up front whether a new activity will be enjoyable, because I (like most people, I believe) can't enjoy something when I'm doing it way too badly. I can enjoy something that I've grown minimally competent enough to appreciate it. I still don't know yet whether I could enjoy English country dance or contra dance.

## Opportunity

I'm currently planning to attend in July the annual [Mideast early music workshop](http://www.mideastearlymusic.addr.com/). They offer a [class](http://www.mideastearlymusic.addr.com/class.html) in English country dance, so it's possible I may want to take that class, if they start from the very basics. However, given time constraints, I would rather be taking music classes at the camp rather than dance classes.

## Conclusion

Sampler lessons like the one at the birthday party today are nice for exposing a total beginner to something new, as an appetizer toward deeper learning, but as I learned in the past, real learning requires sustained and detailed work on basics, with incremental mastery resulting from repetition.

### (Update of 2013-01-23)

It turns out that I did attend the English country dance at the Mideast early music workshop in July 2012.

Also, Abby and I went to [our first contra dance workshop](/blog/2012/10/07/my-first-contra-dance-workshop-unexpected-fun/) in October 2012!
