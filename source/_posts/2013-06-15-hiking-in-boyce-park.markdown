Abby and I did a tiny short hike together in [Boyce Park](http://www.alleghenycounty.us/parks/bpfac.aspx). We've barely done any hiking at all this year, because of her accident breaking a foot and my doing the Pittsburgh Marathon and then getting poison ivy on a hike I did with a friend last month.

We thought we'd combine a hike with a trip to Monroeville to [Patel Brothers](http://www.patelbros.com/) to buy Indian groceries and then eat at [Udipi Cafe](http://www.udipicafepittsburgh.com/), so we did.

It was good to be out together again. We miss hiking so much.
