So it's been less than two weeks since I [started playing flute again](http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/11/09/taking-up-flute-again-after-decades/). One thing I forgot to mention is that [James Galway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Galway) made me hate flute for decades.

The bottom line is that I never liked Galway's distinctive vibrato and sound. Unfortunately, for some reason, I kept on seeing him on TV and hearing him on the radio, and so he sort of represented to me "flute".

## Revival through jazz

Interestingly, I started to enjoy hearing the flute again mainly from getting into jazz. I loved hearing [Herbie Mann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbie_Mann) on flute, for example, and others as well. In fact, my original intention when buying a flute several years ago was to get into jazz flute: I had sort of lost interest in playing classical music by then.

## Discovery of Emmanuel Pahud

### Syrinx

Just a couple of years ago, I was driving and listening to the local classical radio station, [WQED](http://www.wqed.org/fm/), when I was put totally under a spell by a performance of a work for solo flute. Being completely unfamiliar with the classical flute repertoire, I didn't know what the piece was, but the announcer said it was "Syrinx" by Claude Debussy, and performed by one [Emmanuel Pahud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Pahud).

I went and found CDs by Pahud at the library. Great stuff! He is definitely my flute hero.

Here is a beautiful video of Pahud performing "Syrinx" on YouTube:

### Entr'acte from Carmen

It turns out that today I was practicing an arrangement of the Entr'acte from Bizet's Carmen from the ["I Used to Play Flute"](http://www.musicminusone.com/used-play-flute-innovative-method-adults-returning-play-p-60414222.html) book, and out of curiosity, looked up Pahud on YouTube.

Here he is playing it under the young Venezuelan superstar conductor [Gustavo Dudamel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustavo_Dudamel):

Very nice, although his interpretation differs in various ways from my personal conception of the Entr'acte: I would play it faster and more passionately. One reason I feel compelled to play music, and not only listen to it, is that nobody ever plays a piece just how I would play it. To *live* music, I must create it or recreate it afresh. To not do so would be like watching a video of a hike rather than being on the trail hiking and experiencing it.
