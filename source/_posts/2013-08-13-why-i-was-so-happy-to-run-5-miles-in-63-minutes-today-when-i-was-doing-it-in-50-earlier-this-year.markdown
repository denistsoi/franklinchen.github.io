I went for a run in Frick Park, my usual 5-mile route, which I haven't done in a while. It took me 63 minutes. Earlier this year I was doing it in 50. My fitness is pretty low right now, as [I explained three days ago](/blog/2013/08/10/emerging-from-my-three-months-of-illness-self-pitying-and-self-loathing/).

But I'm happy to be on the upswing. I'm getting out there, not pushing too hard, but challenging myself. I have faith that I will get back out of my slump. I have done this before. Other people have.

Do you also have this experience of being happy to do something worse than you used to do it, because you're doing it at all rather than doing nothing?
