Today I "ran" in the annual [Fineview Stepathon](http://stepathon.org/), a truly unique and grueling 5-mile race held in [Fineview](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fineview_(Pittsburgh\)), a geographically fascinating neighborhood in the North Side of Pittsburgh.

This was not the first time I'd run the Stepathon: I'd actually done a shorter version of it (supposedly a 5K, but clearly much shorter given how quickly I finished it) in 2006.

The Web site's description only gives a hint of what this event is like:

{% blockquote %}
Are you a runner, about to run the Great Race?   An urban explorer?  A fitness nut?  Or just a masochist?  How fast should you pace yourself, going up a stairway that rises out of view?  How fast can you go?  One thing for sure, the harder you fight the steps, the harder they fight back!  We saved the best for last…  the legendary Rising Main stairway.  High as a 17-story building, disorienting as it leans this way and that, your legs feeling like jelly as you near the top…  The Stepathon, ready to chew you up and spit you out!
{% endblockquote %}

Here's my report on this fantastic event!
