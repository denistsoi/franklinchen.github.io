Tonight was the [second meeting](http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Scala-Meetup/events/99077622/) of the [Pittsburgh Scala Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Scala-Meetup/). It was our first "real" meeting, in the sense that [our first meetup](/blog/2013/01/11/2013-is-my-year-of-scala/) was just a little gathering in a bar, and this time, we were able to use a nice space in [Revv Oakland](http://www.revvoakland.com/) to meet in.

## Attendance

A large number of people showed up, which was encouraging, indicating local Pittsburgh interest in Scala.

## Presentation

[Josh Suereth](http://jsuereth.com/) gave the first presentation for the group, a version targeted more to novices of the [talk he gave at NE Scala 2013](http://jsuereth.com/scala/2013/02/13/nescala-intro-to-fp-talk.html), "Functional Programming Patterns for the Asynchronous Web".

By the way, his NE Scala talk, which was constrained because it had be squeezed into 30 minutes and for a diverse audience, is available [at the NE Scala site as both video and slides](http://nescala.org/#t-12229286).

## After

After the talk, there was general discussion.

We also brainstormed ideas for a group project. One of the ideas was to create a Web site using [Play](http://www.playframework.com/). Jamie created an initial [GitHub repository for this](https://github.com/pghscala/web).

## Conclusion

It's great that the Pittsburgh Scala Meetup is really getting off the ground now. Now that we have a space to use, hopefully we will begin a regularly occurring meeting. And of course, volunteers are needed to start giving talks!
