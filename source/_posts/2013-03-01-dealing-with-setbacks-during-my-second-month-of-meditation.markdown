A month ago, [I reported on my meditation practice in January 2013](/blog/2013/02/01/a-report-on-one-month-of-daily-meditation/).

The month of February was even more problematic for me than January was. I've noticed a pattern that January tends to start our fairly well, because of rebooting after the winter holidays, but then "feature creep" catches up in life.

I did *not* manage to meditate every single day, but thanks to the [Insight Timer](http://insighttimer.com/) mobile app I use, with its "journal" feature, I have a lot of when I did and my brief thoughts after each session.

## Problems

### Breaking the chain for the first time

I first [broke my chain](/blog/2011/09/26/i-dont-feel-like-practicing-but-im-gonna-do-it-anyway/) of daily meditation on Wednesday, February 6. This was the day after a long [chess tournament game in the evening](/blog/2013/02/05/pittsburgh-chess-club-championship-2013-round-4-fascinating-attacking-defending-game/). According to my journal, I was very busy with exercise, work, and starting to pack for the [NE Scala](http://nescala.org/) conference that I was going to travel to Philadelphia for the next day, Thursday (which I took off from work). I ended up "forgetting" to meditate, and then staying up late, until I realized I had forgotten, and so it was past midnight when I did the meditation session, so it counted for Thursday rather than Wednesday.

The piling up of being "too busy" clearly wrecked my routine. In retrospect, the only solution is to plan better when my routine is going to be broken up by travel or other significant disruptions. Also, there was the matter of just having too much in my routine anyway: I did recognize that Tuesday night chess tournaments were clearly  causing me to stay up too late at night, and so decided already in late January to [stop playing in them](/blog/2013/01/30/why-and-how-i-am-going-to-run-the-2013-pittsburgh-marathon/).

Note: I did manage to get in my daily meditation while at the conference, using the Android version of the app. I squeezed it in on the floor of the hotel suite I shared with Josh and Jamie while they were in the other room.

## Problems with the evening schedule

I never got back onto a reliable morning meditation schedule, although I did continue to meditate before bed. But because of variability in my schedule, I again missed a daily evening session, by mere minutes, on Monday, February 25, when I had a crazy busy day that concluded with [not only stopping by OpenHack Pittsburgh but also attending a music jam](/blog/2013/02/25/stepping-it-up-at-the-french-and-blues-jam/). I didn't forget to meditate; I just stayed up too late for the session to count for Monday.

Again, the real solution is to get the meditation in early in the morning. Having a better home evening routine would also help: I have found that if I stay out too late outside the home for some event, I end up "shifting" my schedule at home rather than cutting things out that I would normally do during an evening staying at home. Abby has advised me on this and I agree with her that this is the right thing to do. On days when I'm out in the evening, I simply cannot expect to have the time to do what I would normally do when not out. I should not shift, but should cut out.

## Conclusion

Despite all the setbacks, I still keep on meditating. It is easy to stop doing something when you realize you're doing it "badly". It is easy to say "what's the point?" or "I'll never get this right" or "I'm a loser". But I keep in mind that meditation is meditation, however it is done. I don't stop flossing my teeth just because I don't always do it perfectly, after all.

It's been two months now since New Year. Do you have New Year habits that you threw yourself into with enthusiasm that you have now fallen away from or are ashamed of not keeping up the way you had hoped? How have you coped with your own imperfection?
