Saturday was the ambitious [Global Day of CodeRetreat](http://blog.coderetreat.com/global-day-of-coderetreat), and I participated in the local [Pittsburgh edition](http://globalcoderetreat2011pittsburgh.eventbrite.com/) of the event. The global event was held simultaneously in 90 cities and had around 2000 attendees. I had a great time, although I was totally exhausted by the time it was over (it lasted from before 9 AM to after 6 PM; what a way to spend a Saturday!).

What is CodeRetreat and why is it important?

## The CodeRetreat concept

CodeRetreat is the brainchild of Corey Haines.

Programmers honing their craft together.

## Why this is relevant to **CSEdWeek**

### What is CSEdWeek?

This week (December 4 through 10, 2011) has been designed as [Computer Science Education Week (CSEDWeek)](http://www.csedweek.org/) by the US House of Representatives to recognize the importance of computer science education for students at all levels.

We shall see at hashtag [#CSEdWeek](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23CSEdWeek) and on blogs this week who actually is responding to this topic of discussion. I am one of over 2000 people who have pledged online to participate in CSEdWeek. I will be blog about **computation** and the **learning** and **teaching** of it, in every context that I have experienced it.

### Definitions, and what is important

What do you think of when you even hear of "Computer Science education"?

- Do you imagine elementary schools equipped with iPads?
- Do you imagine courses about how to use applications such as Microsoft Word or Gmail?
- Do you imagine Advanced Placement courses spreading to every high school in the country, with high enrollments in the courses?
- Do you imagine community college and technical schools teaching something about programming in Java?
- Do you imagine undergraduates learning about mathematical analysis of parallel algorithms?

Personally, I do not like the phrase "computer science". Someone once said, computer science is not about **computers** and is not **science**. I heartily agree. First of all, the essence of what computers do is what is important, not the
