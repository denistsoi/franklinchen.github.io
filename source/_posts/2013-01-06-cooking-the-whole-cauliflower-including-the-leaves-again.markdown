We often get cauliflower with leaves intact. So I end up doing something with both the florets and the leaves, cooking them separately.

## Sauteed cauliflower florets

Sauteed with olive oil, garlic, and random other bits.

## Cauliflower leaf soup

Winter means soup.  Toss in a base of chopped up onion, carrot, celery, and spices, and make cauliflower leaf soup!
