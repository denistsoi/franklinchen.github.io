It's the seventh and final day of Stoic Week 2014! I am very glad I participated in the daily readings and reflections. I've made so many positive changes in my life already. Now it's time to stick to them.

## Health

I've been spending all of the Thanksgiving long holiday weekend catching up on sleep. I have a meditation habit now and today it was warm out and I went for a run and ended up doing five miles in Frick Park. This is the longest distance I've run in months!

## Nature, providence, the larger whole

It is fitting that today's theme is the Stoic view of humanity as being embedded in something bigger, call it "nature" or "providence". Part of why I enjoy running in the trails of Frick Park is that in its own small way, the experience puts me in touch *directly* with something bigger than us; I encounter dogs, chipmunks, trees, creeks, leaves, mud, and even deer (not today, but Abby and I saw one during our hike there yesterday).

I honestly feel more whole and alive when I see more of nature, and not in some self-conscious sentimental way. It's more subtle than that. And there's nothing sentimental about those steep hills that make me gasp for air when I climb them. But I sure appreciate the cleaner air in the park than on the main urban roads of Pittsburgh! And I remember where air comes from and how fragile its quality and composition is. The big picture matters.

## Conclusion

I am grateful for the organizers of Stoic Week for putting it on again this year. Here is something I've decided to do, to keep its spirit alive indefinitely: I will continue to explore various interpretations of Stoicism (note that I don't feel compelled to buy into any particular school or even call myself a Stoic at all), as well as other philosophy (for example, the Zen I had begun looking into years ago) on a daily basis, to keep my mind always focused on applying principles of practical living.

**Did you hear about Stoic Week this year? If you did, why did you choose to participate in it, or more interestingly, choose not to?**
