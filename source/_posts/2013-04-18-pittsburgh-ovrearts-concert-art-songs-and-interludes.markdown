I heard about a free community concert by a local Pittsburgh music group called [OvreArts](http://ovrearts.org/) and decided to check it out, since it promised to perform new works. Abby came along. The program was called "Art songs and interludes".

Here's a video prelude to the concert:

And some words from the young composers:

## The concert

I have a confession to make. I'm not generally so interested in songs, as opposed to purely instrumental music. So I got fatigued by the program of one short work after another.

Also, much of the music had a sacred setting. Outside of that, there were love songs of a largely gentle nature.

It was unusual to me to encounter music that had an "old-fashioned" feel to it from such young composers, but this is apparently part of the united mission of the OvreArts group. I respect their philosophical and musical convictions, but I found the program for this particular concert to be too sedate and not stimulating enough for my taste.

## Other work

To be fair, I looked online to see more about previous work of OvreArts and it seems that I would have enjoyed attending a live performance of a ballet by composers of OvreArts, such as ["Infinity"](http://ovrearts.org/infinity-a-ballet-in-15-tableau/). I found this excerpt definitely stimulating:

I will keep an eye out for new music by OvreArts composers, now that it's on my radar.
