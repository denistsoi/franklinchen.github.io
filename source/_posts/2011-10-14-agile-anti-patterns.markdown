Tonight I left Wednesday [meditation](http://franklinchen.com/blog/2011/09/28/staring-at-the-wall-with-nowhere-to-go/) early, after a half-hour sitting, to rush off to a meeting of the [Pittsburgh Agile meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/PittsburghAgile/). [Andrew Cox](http://andrewcox.org/) gave a very informative talk on [Agile anti-patterns](http://www.meetup.com/PittsburghAgile/events/36899642/).

(Andrew has put up his [slides for "Agile Anti-Patterns"](http://files.meetup.com/1792120/agile-antipatterns.pdf).)

Around ten other people attended (a small turnout compared to some past turnouts). I've been to two or three of this group's meetups so far, and have found them rather useful, prodding me to reflect on my own software development processes and start to make changes to them.

What I like about this group's meetings is that there is a lot of informal discussion and contribution by a diverse array of people who share stories from their work experiences. Some of the participants are new to [Agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development); others have officially adopted it but seek guidance for how to implement it better; others are trying to introduce Agile into an environment that is skeptical of it.
