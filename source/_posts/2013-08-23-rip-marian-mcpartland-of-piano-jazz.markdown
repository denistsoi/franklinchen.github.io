[Marian McPartland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marian_McPartland), longtime host of [NPR's "Piano Jazz"](http://www.npr.org/series/15773266/marian-mcpartland-s-piano-jazz) on the radio, [has died](http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2013/08/21/161653933/marian-mcpartland-piano-jazz-host-has-died).

I really enjoyed dipping into her radio program over the years, hearing her play hearing her guests play, listening to the conversations. The main impression I always had was alertness and *warmth*. RIP.
