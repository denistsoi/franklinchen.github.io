When I was in college, there was an advanced math class that boasted of using a [spiral approach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_approach) of teaching. I looked at the class notes that were a draft of an upcoming textbook, written by the instructors of the course. I thought the draft book was abominably poor and confusing, and I chose not to enroll in the class. As a side effect, in the future I ran away from anything that even suggested a "spiral approach" to learning.

Roughly speaking, the idea of a *spiral* approach is that it contrasts with a bottom-up *linear* approach to learning that I would say dominated my formal education in most subjects. The linear approach seems to make sense and be efficient. Essentially, if you consider a subject to have many different concepts to be mastered, and each concept has "prerequisites" that should be mastered. In short, the entire set of concepts is treated as some kind of [directed acyclic graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) that the instructor (or textbook writer) [topologically sorts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting) into a linearized syllabus.

So, for example, in learning a foreign language, you might first learn about singular nouns and present tense of verbs, and then build up from there. In a spiral approach, you might take a more cross-cutting path through a language, learning immediately how to say "real" sentences in a limited domain with multiple parts of speech and declensions and conjugations and whatnot. (I will return to the foreign language learning example later in this post.)

While reflecting recently on my current learning practices (in music, computer science, blog writing, exercising, etc.), which have been occurring totally outside formal educational institutions for some years now, I realized that I have inadvertently something of a spiral approach than I formerly thought was appropriate.

Let me describe why I rejected the spiral approach at first, and why I seem to have reinvented a version of it for myself now.

## The spiral approach to advanced math

The college course that I did not take used a draft textbook that was very different from the math textbooks I was used to. The kinds of math textbooks I was accustomed to were the epitome of the bottom-up, linear presentation of ideas, using the axiomatic method. For example, in a typical abstract algebra textbook or course, you start with foundational definitions (say, of the concept of set), then proofs of lemmas, theorems, and corollaries, then further definitions (say, of the concept of group), then more proofs, then more definitions (say, of subgroups, then normal subgroups, rings, fields). A very dry approach, but with the advantage of being very thorough.

I did not like the "spiral approach" math textbook because skimming it, I felt I could not really understand all the details of what was going on, and special cases were introduced before the general abstract case, with the result that it was easy to get misconceptions from learning the special case instead of the general case up front, e.g., using only two-dimensional matrices or determinants at first.

In retrospect, I think I was mistaken in dismissing the spiral approach. In fact, it was *not* necessarily the approach that failed, but simply the poor quality of the textbook (there are poor textbooks for any approach)!

It is a matter of judgment to determine what details to gloss over when using a spiral approach.

## Stepping away from formal education

I spent a lot of time in school, and taking classes in school.

The funny thing is, I did not much enjoy taking classes in school. Also, I do not remember much of what I learned in school (in fact, I remember least the material in the classes I was a top student in). Almost everything I remember or use is something I learned outside of school.

My conclusion is that I learn best when not trapped by the structure of school. And worse, I learn best when I am not "mastering" (as measured by A+ grades, for example) huge amounts of material (which I then proceed to forget). I learn best if I'm learning less.

## The virtues of learning less

When do I learn less? When I am not optimizing for "efficiency" by breaking everything down into independent units to linearize. When I always have a big picture in mind. When I stop when stuck, rather than trying to push through immediately.

Not being in school, my learning is very different from when I was. In school, there was a focus on cramming as much material as possible into a course, and being tested on tricky corner cases or obscure details to make sure that we really mastered some unit before moving on.

### Learning much

If you're a computer programmer, imagine being forced to take a fiendish exam that tests whether you've mastered the ugly parts, the intricacies, of a programming language, and memorized the APIs of every important library.

If you're learning a foreign language, imagine being forced to master all the irregular verbs or all the use cases of definite or indefinite articles, up front.

If you're learning to cook, imagine being forced to memorize and define dozens of equipment and technique terms, demonstrate the dozens of ways to properly use a knife, etc.

### Contrast with learning less

Now think about how you might go about learning less.

If you're a computer programmer learning a new language and ecosystem, you could learn enough to be productive without mastering or memorizing everything. Yes, at some point if you want to become a better Java programmer, you might want to go through [Java Puzzlers](http://www.javapuzzlers.com/), but it's not really necessary, and it is also not immediately necessary to master the [Java Language Specification](http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third_edition/html/j3TOC.html).

If you're learning a foreign language, you could learn enough to be understood for basic communication with a native speaker, without getting all the grammar and vocabulary perfect.

If you're learning to cook, you might pick some dish and learn enough techniques to prepare it.

## The vices of learning less

I may have made it sound like learning less is always a good thing.

It is not.

In fact, my suspicion of "learning less" is what prompted me to try to "learn much" during a long period in my life.

I already mentioned how learning only about two-dimensional matrices in math could be a dangerous trap leading to not understanding three-dimensional or hundred-dimensional matrices. Similarly, many computer programmers are coding with barely any "real" understanding of what they are doing; many foreign language learners are stuck at horrible "phrase book" levels of language proficiency; many people cooking at home repeatedly create disasters without making real progress.

What is missing in these examples of failures?

- basic foundational understanding
- personal awareness of current simplifications made
- objective assessment and correction
- refactoring of mental framework
- a plan to deepen further learning with iterations
