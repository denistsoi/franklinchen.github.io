I just reported on a [chess game I played that featured the Veresov Opening](/blog/2012/11/27/round-3-of-pittsburgh-chess-club-tournament-the-difficult-opponent-and-revenge-of-the-bishop/).

Back when I was playing the Veresov as White, I studied it using [GM Nigel Davies'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Davies_\(chess_player\)) book from 2003, ["The Veresov"](http://www.amazon.com/Veresov-Surprise-Your-Oponents-Tricky/dp/1857443357).

On page 48 of the book, Davies claimed that `f5` "is quite weakening" and recommended against it. The computer engines disagree. I will continue, as Black, to happily play `f5` against anyone who wants to play White in the Veresov Gambit against me.

At some point, I will write about the question of human expertise and judgment versus that of computers. Let's just say that using computers, I have in the past come up with significant improvements or alternative ideas over the advice in chess books, and used these novelties in games I have played; however, I also believe that the wisdom and creativity of human experts, such as Davies, will never be completely replaced by computers.

## Chess Improver blog

By the way, I really recommend the ["Chess Improver" blog](http://chessimprover.com/) that Nigel Davies and others write for. This blog is a direct inspiration for my having started to write about my chess games and experiences.

And go [friend him on Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/nigel.davies1) if you are interested in engaging in discussions of the posts on his blog.

## Conclusion

If you want to really understand a chess position, use a chess computer engine and explore. Don't rely entirely on books.
