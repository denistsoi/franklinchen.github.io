Yesterday, after four days of [not even touching my (modern) flute](/blog/2012/03/07/flute-taking-a-break-while-clarifying-my-goals) and having spent the time having fun with my Baroque flute instead, I felt the urge to return to the modern flute.

I still have not regained the inclination to continue working on the orchestra music I still have to improve a lot on in the coming week, but I rediscovered the joy of simply playing my instrument.

## Sound, intonation

The perpetual challenges of getting clean sounds and accurate pitches on the Baroque flute in the past four days have given me an increased appreciation for the modern flute. I picked it up and spent time just trying to make beautiful sounds. Freed from the stress of orchestra practice, I felt much more relaxed on the instrument than I have for a while now.

To my surprise (but not really), I have improved considerably on the flute after not playing it for four days. I really needed a break, a consolidation of lessons learned. My production of tones is much improved, and high notes are squeaking less.

## Music for dance

One thing I've truly come to realize is that I particularly enjoy playing rhythmic music suitable for dancing.

Indeed, every time I attend a dance, and there is live music, I experience a strange internal conflict: I do like to dance, but sometimes, I'd rather be on the other side of the dance floor, being the musical performer! The *only* time I've been on the other side has been at last year's [Pittsburgh Contras and Squares](http://pittsburghcontra.org/) Holiday Ball.

The most recent instance of my wishing I could sometimes stop dancing and just join the musicians has been at the local [Pittsburgh French dance workshop and social](http://coalcountry.org/frenchdance.html), where we've had live piano, fiddle, and of course, [Gregory](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~gdyke/) on his Irish flute. I wonder whether at some point I might be qualified to play for the event, using either my modern flute or Baroque flute. (By the way, it was held again today, but unfortunately, Abby and I chose not to go because we had too many things to do this weekend.)

## Remembering dancing

Yesterday I spent time playing along to a score/CD set I've mentioned before, [World Music Cuba](http://www.amazon.com/World-Music-Cuba-Flute-play-along/dp/3702465804). While playing the bolero, cha cha, and mambo pieces in particular, I felt I was returning "home" in many ways. This was among the first music I heard and saw people dancing to when I was curious and visited the [CMU Ballroom Dance Club](http://cmubdc.org/) in 2000, and fell in love with, and learned to dance to. I also played along to [World Music Argentina](http://www.amazon.com/Play-along-Argentina-Flute-World-Music/dp/3702465871).

### Some photos of my ballroom dance days

Here are some photos of me dancing in 2002 with my last dance partner, Amy, before I quit competitive ballroom dancing.

Here we are at the [DC DanceSport Inferno](http://www.dcdancesportinferno.com/) in 2002 doing a hockey stick in international rumba:

And here were are at the [Cornell DanceSport Classic](http://comp.cornelldancesport.org/) in 2002 in cha cha, rumba, and tango:

## Dancing with Abby

But never mind the ballroom dance days. It was through salsa dancing that I met my wife!

### How I met Abby

It was through dancing that I met Abby in the first place. After quitting dancing in 2003, I never danced again until late 2006, when my friend Jon told me he had recently started salsa dancing (because of a girlfriend who got him into it) and invited me to join him at a free outdoors dance, and I went. Then as I re-entered the Pittsburgh salsa dance scene, I kept running into Abby.

### Some photos of us dancing salsa

There are not many photos of Abby dancing with me, because when I'm dancing, I'm not holding my camera, but here are some photos a friend took at a big salsa dance weekend at the Palisades in McKeesport in April 2008, a year after we started dating in 2007.

## Expression and improvisation in dance and in music

### Dance

One reason I gave up ballroom dancing was that I felt there was an overemphasis on "syllabus steps" (I realize this is an oversimplification of the ballroom dance culture; all very good ballroom dancers go beyond the syllabus mindset). After quitting ballroom dancing, I explored Argentine tango, which is all about improvisation, but I left it because (at the time) it seemed that most of the women in the local scene were very tall, which made dancing awkward for me. I got into salsa because freed from the closed embrace, there was clearly a lot of room for personal improvisation. Ironically, I first got into making stuff up as a result of my imperfect memory: I could never memorize long choreography of step patterns, whether I was doing ballroom dancing or anything else. So I would always make a "mistake", then I would make something out of the mistake. I learned that as long as you get back in time with the music, and keep the lead and follow communication strong, there is no such thing really as a mistake. You just keep going, with whatever is happening at the present moment.

I now have a long-term goal of developing my technique and releasing my inhibitions so that I can improvise musically at will. Yesterday, I played with improvising when playing bolero, cha cha, and tango. It was a lot of fun and profoundly satisfying.

### Music

I actually credit my study of the recorder and the Baroque flute for reawakening me to my dream of free expression and improvisation. Baroque music leaves room for a lot of interpretation of trills and ornamentation and articulation (subject, of course, to "good taste"). I want to go beyond that, but it has been a great starting point. For some reason, too much exposure to later music (such as Beethoven) had turned me into a score-reader, since such later music has so much already marked up for the performer to simply *obey*. The sparse annotations in Renaissance and Baroque music give one much more freedom.

## Conclusion

I am enjoying playing the flute again, now that I know what I really want to do with it. And I would like to merge my dance and music lives, just as Abby has always played the Balkan music she also dances to.

I ended up [quitting the CMU AUO](/blog/2012/03/12/quitting-the-cmu-all-university-orchestra-one-of-the-hardest-decisions-in-my-life/).

## (Update of 2013-01-26)

Almost a year later, I finally played tangos on flute [at a party](/blog/2013/01/26/music-i-just-played-for-the-first-time-recorder-sonata-tangos/).

## (Update of 2013-03-17)

Almost exactly a year later, I ended up playing selections from the World Music Cuba book [at a party](/blog/2013/03/17/finally-doing-some-latin-music-jamming-on-flute/), and improvising freely with two other guys!
