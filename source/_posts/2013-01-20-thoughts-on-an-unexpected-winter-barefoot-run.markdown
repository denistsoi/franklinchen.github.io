Yesterday, I went on my first ever *winter barefoot run*.

It's *not* what you think; or maybe, it *is* what you think.

## Sunny day

Yes, there was still some snow on the ground. But it was purely residual.

It was a sunny day. A *warm* day, temperature of about 53 degrees F.

Originally I had planned to go for a run like I did a couple of days ago, [in Vibram FiveFingers shoes](/blog/2013/01/17/winter-running-in-vibram-fivefingers-shoes-revisited/). But I changed my mind when I realized just how warm it was.

Impulsively, I just hopped out the door in my short-sleeve T-shirt and shorts, and *barefoot*, because it seemed that I could. What other winter have I had, during my lifetime spent in the northern United States, when I could go out running barefoot?

## The run

I ended up running less than about three miles, because I faced some annoyances:

- the roads and sidewalks were actually pretty cold
- there was a lot of debris out there (ouch!), left behind after the snow melted; some of it was clearly salt crystals

## Putting on shoes

I ended up going back home and putting on my [Xero Shoes (4mm Connect)](/blog/2012/07/26/walking-and-running-in-invisible-shoes-a-review) that have become my favorite running footwear (when the weather allows; I stopped wearing them last fall shortly after the Great Race 10K, which was [my first race running in them](/blog/2012/09/30/running-my-10th-great-race-10k-obscene-but-in-a-good-way/)). I felt much better wearing these huaraches and went back out to run another three miles.

## Somber thoughts

I had a good time running outside as though it were spring or fall, but actually, I get worried every time this winter I am able to do something like this.

It's not normal.

And it's not good.

[2012 was a record warm year for the continental United States](http://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/comment.html?entrynum=112).

It's not pleasant contemplating [global climate change](http://climate.nasa.gov/).

## Conclusion

It's been nice being able to run in winter here in Pittsburgh without being all bundled up. But that is a constant reminder to me that something weird has been happening to our planet.
