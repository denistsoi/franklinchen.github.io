After work, I had originally planned to do the Cathedral of Learning stair climb [as I have been doing for some weeks now](/blog/2013/01/25/notes-on-exercising-while-sick-or-tired/), stuffing my coat and sweater jacket and shoes and socks into my backpack, before heading to the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh to pick up some items, but was running late, so I resigned myself to skipping the workout and just picking up the library items and heading home for dinner; the stair climb would have to wait for another day.

But after picking up 18 pounds of books from the library, I saw a message from Abby saying that she was out for a walk and would be home later, so I decided that I had time to do one repetition of the stair climb. The "problem" was that I had a fully loaded backpack of books.

No problem. The situation just gave me an *opportunity* for an *unexpected* workout: doing the 36-floor stair climb with an extra 18 pounds of weight.

So I went and did it. The main annoyance was having to keep my shoes on and having to hold my coat and sweater jacket with my arms while going up.

But I did it, and felt really great afterwards, getting in a nice workout before dinner and successfully completing a new challenge.

## Conclusion

When things don't go as planned, often it pays to come up with a different plan.
