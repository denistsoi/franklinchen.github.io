A while back I heard about a "100 Up" workout for runners to improve their form and performance but filed it away without checking it out. I assumed it was gimmicky. But I finally looked it up, and it is actually utterly simple, yet challenging.

Well, I'm going to take up the challenge of doing it for 30 days in a row. I'll fire off a single tweet each day after I complete the "100 Up" for the day.

How about [joining me](http://www.naturalrunningstore.com/100UpChallenge)?
