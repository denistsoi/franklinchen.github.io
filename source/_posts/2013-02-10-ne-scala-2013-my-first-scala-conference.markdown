I went to my first ever Scala conference, [NE Scala](http://nescala.org/), held in Philadelphia, with Josh and Jamie, as mentioned in my report on [the very first Pittsburgh Scala meetup group meeting](/blog/2013/01/11/2013-is-my-year-of-scala/).

It was intense. Being a novice to Scala, most of the talks I attended covered stuff completely new to me.

I returned determined to dig deeper into the Scala ecosystem and use the language effectively.

## Videos

Videos of the talks are available at [this play list](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLndbWGuLoHeaOpTHoNhelI4NdnSqpeXA7).

By the way, [an episode of Scalawags was recorded live at NE Scala](http://scalawags.tv/scalawags-live-at-ne-scala) and does not appear in that play list. I was present and thought it was a very useful question and answer session.

## (Update of 2014-01-16)

This is an unfinished post that is one of many in the past two years that lay unfinished because I had originally planned to write a very detailed report but never got around to it. I decided that I might as well release all these unfinished posts rather than leave them completely out of the record.

Meanwhile, almost a year later, I am still using Scala. I really did stop writing new Java code at work and switch to Scala.

NE Scala 2014 registration recently opened up; unfortunately, it is in New York City, far away, and space is limited, so I am not attending.
