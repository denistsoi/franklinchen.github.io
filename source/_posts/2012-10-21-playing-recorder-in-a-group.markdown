Today was the second meeting of the current season of the [Pittsburgh chapter of the American Recorder Society](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/lukas/pcars/Welcome.html). I reported last month on [how excited I was to begin the new season](/blog/2012/09/16/excited-by-the-new-season-of-the-pittsburgh-recorder-society/).

And it's not just about the tasty desserts that Helen makes for us every month, of course (which basically compel me to exercise *before* going to the meeting).

We had some new people joining us today, including a woman who had been a member of the recorder society three decades ago, and now was retired and getting back into playing the recorder. It was great having her on board. We have some really good music selections from our director Fred to work on, hopefully toward a holiday performance by our group.

She mentioned it being different and hard playing in an ensemble, since she was used to playing piano alone. Her comments made me immediately think back to where I was a year ago. Coincidentally, almost exactly a year ago, [I wrote about the challenges of playing in a group](/blog/2011/10/30/harder-to-play-in-a-group-than-alone/).

I'm so grateful for the opportunity to play with others. It makes me realize that I spent far too much of my life being alone, doing everything alone, and that I was really missing out. Yes, being with others may be more difficult sometimes, but it completely changes my experience of life, making it so much richer.
