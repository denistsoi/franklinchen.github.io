I concluded my series of posts about the Pittsburgh Chess Club six-round Tuesday night tournament that I just completed with an article about managing to draw my final round game: [The strange pleasure of drawing a lost game](http://chessimprover.com/the-strange-pleasure-of-drawing-a-lost-game/).

Now that my tournament is over, I will use other material for my weekly blog posts on [The Chess Improver](http://chessimprover.com/)!
