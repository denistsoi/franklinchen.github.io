Happy [Programmers' Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmers'_Day)!

I only by accident found out that today was Programmers' Day. It is apparently observed the 256th day of each year. This is my first year of "observing" the day.

Since the day is almost over, I hurriedly came up with this little piece of code. Guess what it does?

{% codeblock Mystery Ruby lang:ruby http://github.com/FranklinChen/programmers-day/blob/master/ruby/mystery.rb %}
  {% github FranklinChen/programmers-day b3bed2957dcff639fc8ea74017ba0d19e3aa87f0 %}
{% endcodeblock %}

<!--more-->

The trick, of course, lies in what we have in `utils.rb`:

{% codeblock Utilities lang:ruby http://github.com/FranklinChen/programmers-day/blob/master/ruby/utils.rb %}
  {% github FranklinChen/programmers-day 4426c73c0b79b0c5f0cc9939f38abcf2377de84c %}
{% endcodeblock %}

Very simple, nothing fancy, but perverse enough for a bit of Programmers' Day fun.
