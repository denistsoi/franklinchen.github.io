Today in Dunkin' Donuts in Squirrel Hill was another [J-Jam](http://jjampgh.webs.com/) of music. I'd performed in a [J-Jam in October over three months ago](/blog/2012/10/28/singing-and-playing-bossa-nova-favorite-chega-de-saudade-at-dunkin-donuts-for-j-jam/), but did not perform or attend the J-Jam in December. This time, I again did not perform, but did attend with Abby to watch and listen.

The reason I did not perform is that I came back from a [Scala conference](http://nescala.org/) just late yesterday night, so I was yet again too busy to meet up with Ben to prepare something to perform, and also even if we had something, I was not confident I would be up to performing just after coming home. I was right: I came home exhausted and slept in today before making it to J-Jam at all.

I was glad we did attend, however, because it's so wonderful to see local musicians come together and have fun. As a reminder, this community event also serves as a fundraiser for the [Squirrel Hill Food Pantry](http://www.sqfoodpantry.org/): donations are accepted at J-Jam.

Abby had to leave early, and I myself did not stay until the very end, but saw most of the performances, and left very happy. I hope that later this year I'll perform in it again.

Thank you, [Ben](http://cantorben.com/) and [Joel](http://www.boulevardoftheallies.com/), for putting this together again!
