It's been eleven days since [my last blog post on my flute progress](/blog/2012/03/10/flute-loving-it-again/). During this time, there have been various changes in my life, including *radical* changes in my musical life. It will take me a couple of additional blog posts to discuss these changes, but for now, I'll talk only about today's snapshot of my flute activity.

## Thumbport

Today I received a [Thumbport II](http://www.thumbport.com/) I ordered recently. It's a snap-on device that helps with holding a flute, by making it easier to balance the flute on the right thumb, thereby decreasing rolling of the flute and pressure on the right pinkie finger. I tried it for the first time today and it seems useful. We'll see if it helps a bit with my form and [injury issues](/blog/2012/03/07/flute-taking-a-break-while-clarifying-my-goals/).

## I celebrated the 327th birthday of Johann Sebastian Bach

I don't follow celebrity birthdays, but I could not avoid hearing about the birthday of [Johann Sebastian Bach, born in 1685](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach), thanks to some music blogs I follow.

How to celebrate? The last time I celebrated a composer's birthday, it was last October, for Franz Liszt's 200th birthday. Then, I listened to a piece of music by the composer and [wrote up my impressions of it](/blog/2011/10/22/happy-200th-birthday/). Today, I again had the option to read about Bach or his music, and but I mostly chose to play his music, in order to celebrate as *actively* as possible.

### Playing the cello suite no. 1 in G major, BWV 1007

I sight read a bunch of old Bach's music that eventually I should practice seriously to play well, including various minuets and bourr√©es.

But the main piece I sight read was the full [cello suite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cello_Suites_(Bach\)) no. 1 in G major, using an [arrangement for flute by Peter Billam](http://www.pjb.com.au/mus/arr.html). (I had actually obtained this a long time ago intending to play it on alto [recorder](/blog/categories/recorder/).)

This music is deceptively simple but really quite beautiful. Even visually it is pleasing: check out Bach's handwritten score:

#### Visual animation

By the way, you must check out the following unconventional visual animated representation of this music (see the creator's [blog post about its construction](http://blog.chenalexander.com/2011/baroque-bach-cello/)).

## Bossa nova

Today I also picked up from the public library another play-along score/CD set, this time a ["Latin jazz" collection](http://www.halleonard.com/product/viewproduct.do?itemid=843016&lid=1&keywords=latin&seriesfeature=JZPLYA&). Apart from the famous mambo "Ran Kan Kan" by Tito Puente, the rest was actually bossa nova, which was what I got it for. Recently I decided to get more into playing jazz and working on improvisation. Since I love the harmonies and tunes of classic bossa nova, I decided this was a good place to get started.

I had a lot of fun playing around with the accompaniment CD. Actually, I would also like to sing this music, but unlike with salsa and bolero, where I am completely comfortable singing in Spanish, I am not proficient in the Portuguese language and it trips me up.

## Conclusion

I just thought I'd provide a short update on some of my current musical activities, until I have time to write about the big changes I've made in my musical life.

## A musical tangent: Bach's Goldberg Variations

In turns out there is a whole series of [posts on the NPR music blog about the Goldberg Variations](http://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/148455347/goldberg-week). I could not resist dipping into this series, because I am a Goldberg geek. I would like someday to get good enough on piano to play much of it.
