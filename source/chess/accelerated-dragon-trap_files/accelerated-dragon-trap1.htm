I played this game during my final tournament of my childhood chess career, at age 15, before starting the 11th grade in high school. I retired after this tournament, to focus on academics during the final two years of high school. This game was published in the Michigan Chess magazine. I was somewhat embarrassed that it was published, and I never showed  off the game to my father. Why was I "ashamed" of this "brilliant" game? I'll explain.   </p>

To the untrained eye, this game looks brilliant. I felt a little proud of it, in the sense that I envisioned a forced winning combination, calculated it out correctly, and executed it, but I felt somewhat like a fraud because I completely stole the basic theme from somewhere. In fact, I stole it from a game I remembered from my chess studies seven years earlier, when I was eight years old: Fischer-Reshevsky, US Chess Championship 1958.     </p>
