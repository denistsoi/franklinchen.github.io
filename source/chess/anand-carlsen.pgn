1. Nf3  { Carlsen signals that he is probably avoiding an aggressive opening struggle and hopes to simply get an acceptable middle game and somehow outplay Anand.}  1... d5  { The most solid response, grabbing the center and taking control of White's e4 square.}  2. g3  { Validates my guess that Carlsen is avoiding a fight in the opening. White has no opening advantage here. More aggressive instead would have been d4 or c4.}  2... g6  { Anand immediately goes for a Gruenfeld. I think he has already morally won the opening battle. White will eventually have to play d4 to prevent Black's e5, and then we will have a drawish symmetrical Gruenfeld.}  3. Bg2 Bg7 4. d4 c6 5. O-O Nf6 6. b3 ( 6. c4  { Would have transposed into a typical Gruenfeld position immediately.}  ) 6... O-O 7. Bb2 Bf5  { Continuing piece development.}  8. c4 ( 8. Nbd2  { Supporting c4 with more protection is what I expected and would have played myself.}  ) 8... Nbd7 9. Nc3 $2  { A surprise to me, because of the potentially weak c4 Pawn. A known drawback of g3 against the Gruenfeld is that White's light-squared Bishop is not around to protect the c4 Pawn.}  9... dxc4  { Thematic in this type of position, where Black risks getting squeezed on the Queen side if he does not disrupt White's possible expansion plans that may begin with a suitably prepared c5.}  10. bxc4 Nb6 $1  { Active and good, attacking White's c4 Pawn. White's opening experiment has completely failed.}  11. c5  { A very ugly move, ceding the c4 and d5 light squares.}  ( 11. Ne5 $2  { A natural attempt to protect the c4 Pawn.}  11... Ng4  { White's c4 and d4 Pawns are under severe pressure and he is about to lose a Pawn.}  ) 11... Nc4 12. Bc1  { Wow, what an ugly position for White.}  12... Nd5  { Black has lovely Knight play, which is often the case in the Gruenfeld, even when White plays more accurately. Right now, Black threatens White's Knight on c3 and also opens up the a1 to h8 diagonal for the fianchettoed Bishop on g7.}  13. Qb3  { Basically forced.}  ( 13. Nxd5 $2 cxd5  { White stands clearly worse in this position, in which Black's pieces are all better than White's, and the c5 Pawn is not going anywhere.}  ) 13... Na5  { Accepting the draw by repetition.}  ( 13... Nxc3 $2 14. Qxc3  { Not good for Black, because of the stranded Knight on c4.}  ) 14. Qa3 ( 14. Qb2  { Same consequence of a draw by repetition.}  14... Nc4 15. Qb3 ) 14... Nc4 15. Qb3 Na5 16. Qa3 Nc4  { Anand must have been ecstatic by the outcome of this game: a quick draw as Black, without even any struggle. Carlsen cannot be happy.}   1/2-1/2

1. e4 c6  {  An interesting psychological choice by Carlsen. Anand is the one who plays the Caro-Kann as Black!}  2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bf5  {  The solid Classical Variation.}  5. Ng3 Bg6 6. h4 h6 7. Nf3 e6 8. Ne5  {  Unusual. h5 followed by Bd3 is the well-worn main line.}  8... Bh7 9. Bd3 Bxd3 10. Qxd3 Nd7 11. f4  {  Interesting attempt to maintain hold of the e5 square. It is potentially weakening and time-consuming, however. White's King side looks loose, especially the h4 Pawn.}  11... Bb4+  {  A typical maneuver to provoke White into moving the c Pawn and weaken the Queen side, since White is obviously going to castle Queen side soon.}  12. c3 Be7  {  Attacking the h4 Pawn.}  13. Bd2 $201  {  Offering the h4 Pawn as a sacrifice!}  13... Ngf6  {  Carlsen wisely declines the sacrifice.}  ( 13... Bxh4  {  Accepting the sacrifice looks very dangerous for Black.}  14. O-O-O  {  Black now has to figure out how to get his King to safety before White blasts through (with suitable preparation) with ideas like f5.}  14... Bxg3  {  Best to get rid of the Bishop that is hampering Black's Queen mobility and remaining Knight development.}  ( 14... Bf6  {  Keeping the Bishop, hoping to use it for defending g7. Also there is a threat of taking on e5.}  15. Qe2  {  Getting out of the way of the pin on the d4 Pawn and maintaining pressure. White clearly has compensation for the sacrificed Pawn. A natural progression will have Black managing to castle Queen side but White attempting to regain the Pawn on the King side while retaining a positional advantage. The problem for Black is that he cannot castle as long as f7 is undefended from White's strong Knight on e5. So the Knight must be exchanged off, but that leaves the f7 square vulnerable again because of the half-open f file. So Black has nothing to look forward to in this position.}  ) 15. Qxg3  {  But now Black's dark squares are weak. It may be that the position is defensible for Black, but it is clearly unpleasant: Black's King may never get to castle in the rest of the game!}  ) 14. O-O-O O-O 15. Ne4  {  Trying to make way for an attack starting with g4. But it means allowing a trade of pieces, which benefits the side under attack (Black).}  15... Nxe4 16. Qxe4 Nxe5  {  Continuing to simplify.}  17. fxe5  {  Now Black must do something about White's plan to attack on the King side.}  17... Qd5  {  Attacking the a2 Pawn.}  18. Qxd5  {  Very surprising to me. Anand allows the Queen trade! This is tantamount to accepting a draw.}  ( 18. Qb1 $2  {  Protecting the a2 Pawn is possible but terrible.}  18... c5  {  The thematic counterattack against White's center. In this case, White's King is also vulnerable. White stands poorly.}  ) ( 18. Qg4  {  White could have avoided the trade of Queens and attempted to keep the game alive.}  18... Kh7 19. Kb1  {  White retains attacking chances against Black's King, although Black can also attack on the other flank very soon with c5, etc.}  ) 18... cxd5  {  White's position may look better, but there should be no way either side can make progress. White has the half open f file, but Black has the half open c file. White has more space, but not enough pieces to force a break. If both sides had an extra Knight, there would be more chances.}  19. h5 b5  {  Starting the thematic "minority attack" against White's c3 Pawn.}  20. Rh3 a5 21. Rf1 Rac8  {  Eventually Black will continue with b4, but is not in any rush.}  22. Rg3  {  Seeing nothing, Anand forces a draw by repetition rather than allow the minority attack to begin against c3, which would tie White down for a draw anyway.}  22... Kh7 23. Rgf3 Kg8 24. Rg3 Kh7 25. Rgf3 Kg8  1/2-1/2
