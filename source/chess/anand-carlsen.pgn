1. Nf3  { Carlsen signals that he is probably avoiding an aggressive opening struggle and hopes to simply get an acceptable middle game and somehow outplay Anand.}  1... d5  { The most solid response, grabbing the center and taking control of White's e4 square.}  2. g3  { Validates my guess that Carlsen is avoiding a fight in the opening. White has no opening advantage here. More aggressive instead would have been d4 or c4.}  2... g6  { Anand immediately goes for a Gruenfeld. I think he has already morally won the opening battle. White will eventually have to play d4 to prevent Black's e5, and then we will have a drawish symmetrical Gruenfeld.}  3. Bg2 Bg7 4. d4 c6 5. O-O Nf6 6. b3 ( 6. c4  { Would have transposed into a typical Gruenfeld position immediately.}  ) 6... O-O 7. Bb2 Bf5  { Continuing piece development.}  8. c4 ( 8. Nbd2  { Supporting c4 with more protection is what I expected and would have played myself.}  ) 8... Nbd7 9. Nc3 $2  { A surprise to me, because of the potentially weak c4 Pawn. A known drawback of g3 against the Gruenfeld is that White's light-squared Bishop is not around to protect the c4 Pawn.}  9... dxc4  { Thematic in this type of position, where Black risks getting squeezed on the Queen side if he does not disrupt White's possible expansion plans that may begin with a suitably prepared c5.}  10. bxc4 Nb6 $1  { Active and good, attacking White's c4 Pawn. White's opening experiment has completely failed.}  11. c5  { A very ugly move, ceding the c4 and d5 light squares.}  ( 11. Ne5 $2  { A natural attempt to protect the c4 Pawn.}  11... Ng4  { White's c4 and d4 Pawns are under severe pressure and he is about to lose a Pawn.}  ) 11... Nc4 12. Bc1  { Wow, what an ugly position for White.}  12... Nd5  { Black has lovely Knight play, which is often the case in the Gruenfeld, even when White plays more accurately. Right now, Black threatens White's Knight on c3 and also opens up the a1 to h8 diagonal for the fianchettoed Bishop on g7.}  13. Qb3  { Basically forced.}  ( 13. Nxd5 $2 cxd5  { White stands clearly worse in this position, in which Black's pieces are all better than White's, and the c5 Pawn is not going anywhere.}  ) 13... Na5  { Accepting the draw by repetition.}  ( 13... Nxc3 $2 14. Qxc3  { Not good for Black, because of the stranded Knight on c4.}  ) 14. Qa3 ( 14. Qb2  { Same consequence of a draw by repetition.}  14... Nc4 15. Qb3 ) 14... Nc4 15. Qb3 Na5 16. Qa3 Nc4  { Anand must have been ecstatic by the outcome of this game: a quick draw as Black, without even any struggle. Carlsen cannot be happy.}   1/2-1/2

1. e4 c6  { An interesting psychological choice by Carlsen. Anand is the one who plays the Caro-Kann as Black!}  2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bf5  { The solid Classical Variation.}  5. Ng3 Bg6 6. h4 h6 7. Nf3 e6 8. Ne5  { Unusual. h5 followed by Bd3 is the well-worn main line.}  8... Bh7 9. Bd3 Bxd3 10. Qxd3 Nd7 11. f4  { Interesting attempt to maintain hold of the e5 square. It is potentially weakening and time-consuming, however. White's King side looks loose, especially the h4 Pawn.}  11... Bb4+  { A typical maneuver to provoke White into moving the c Pawn and weaken the Queen side, since White is obviously going to castle Queen side soon.}  12. c3 Be7  { Attacking the h4 Pawn.}  13. Bd2 $201  { Offering the h4 Pawn as a sacrifice!}  13... Ngf6  { Carlsen wisely declines the sacrifice.}  ( 13... Bxh4  { Accepting the sacrifice looks very dangerous for Black.}  14. O-O-O  { Black now has to figure out how to get his King to safety before White blasts through  (  with suitable preparation  )  with ideas like f5.}  14... Bxg3  { Best to get rid of the Bishop that is hampering Black's Queen mobility and remaining Knight development.}  ( 14... Bf6  { Keeping the Bishop, hoping to use it for defending g7. Also there is a threat of taking on e5.}  15. Qe2  { Getting out of the way of the pin on the d4 Pawn and maintaining pressure. White clearly has compensation for the sacrificed Pawn. A natural progression will have Black managing to castle Queen side but White attempting to regain the Pawn on the King side while retaining a positional advantage. The problem for Black is that he cannot castle as long as f7 is undefended from White's strong Knight on e5. So the Knight must be exchanged off, but that leaves the f7 square vulnerable again because of the half-open f file. So Black has nothing to look forward to in this position.}  ) 15. Qxg3  { But now Black's dark squares are weak. It may be that the position is defensible for Black, but it is clearly unpleasant: Black's King may never get to castle in the rest of the game!}  ) 14. O-O-O O-O 15. Ne4  { Trying to make way for an attack starting with g4. But it means allowing a trade of pieces, which benefits the side under attack  (  Black  )  .}  15... Nxe4 16. Qxe4 Nxe5  { Continuing to simplify.}  17. fxe5  { Now Black must do something about White's plan to attack on the King side.}  17... Qd5  { Attacking the a2 Pawn.}  18. Qxd5  { Very surprising to me. Anand allows the Queen trade! This is tantamount to accepting a draw.}  ( 18. Qb1 $2  { Protecting the a2 Pawn is possible but terrible.}  18... c5  { The thematic counterattack against White's center. In this case, White's King is also vulnerable. White stands poorly.}  ) ( 18. Qg4  { White could have avoided the trade of Queens and attempted to keep the game alive.}  18... Kh7 19. Kb1  { White retains attacking chances against Black's King, although Black can also attack on the other flank very soon with c5, etc.}  ) 18... cxd5  { White's position may look better, but there should be no way either side can make progress. White has the half open f file, but Black has the half open c file. White has more space, but not enough pieces to force a break. If both sides had an extra Knight, there would be more chances.}  19. h5 b5  { Starting the thematic "minority attack" against White's c3 Pawn.}  20. Rh3 a5 21. Rf1 Rac8  { Eventually Black will continue with b4, but is not in any rush.}  22. Rg3  { Seeing nothing, Anand forces a draw by repetition rather than allow the minority attack to begin against c3, which would tie White down for a draw anyway.}  22... Kh7 23. Rgf3 Kg8 24. Rg3 Kh7 25. Rgf3 Kg8  1/2-1/2

1. Nf3  { The Reti again, as in round 1. I wonder how many more times Carlsen will try the Reti.}  1... d5 2. g3 g6 3. c4  { Finally, a more unbalanced continuation.}  3... dxc4  { Ambitious, immediately creating an asymmetric Pawn structure.}  ( 3... c6  { Anand could have continued in Slav style, in which case I'm not sure what Carlsen was planning. It is possible that eventually he was going to play the unbalancing d3 instead of the sterile d4 of the first round.}  4. Bg2 Bg7 5. O-O Nf6 6. d3 O-O  { My prediction for how the game would have gone.}  ) 4. Qa4+  { Deciding to ensure regaining the Pawn eventually with the Queen.}  ( 4. Bg2 Nc6 5. O-O Bg7 6. Qa4 e5  { Would have transposed.}  ) ( 4. Na3  { Possible, but the Knight is not particularly well-placed at a3 or even c4.}  ) 4... Nc6 5. Bg2 Bg7 6. Nc3 e5  { Ambitious, transposing into a reversed Dragon.}  7. Qxc4  { White has regained the Pawn, resulting in a reversed Dragon position, but at the cost of moving the Queen around. I would consider that White's opening has already failed. Black has even saved a tempo compared to analogous positions in which the Knight goes to d5 and then retreats back to e7. The position is one of dynamic equality, but nothing for White to be excited by. I would rather be Black.}  7... Nge7 8. O-O O-O 9. d3 h6 $201 10. Bd2 Nd4 $5  { A surprise to me. I do not think this is good. This is thematic in some positions in this opening structure, but given that Black still has to complete development and has more space and therefore exchanges favor White, I would have waited.}  ( 10... Be6  { Perfectly natural and what I would have played, continuing development.}  ) 11. Nxd4  { White cannot afford to leave Black's Knight on its powerful outpost.}  11... exd4 12. Ne4  { Black now may have a thorn in White's center, but the half-open c file is somewhat loose, and the c5 square still belongs to White. White has a good Knight on e4 and White's Bishop on g2 has also been unleashed by this trade.}  12... c6  { Blocking up the a8 to h1 diagonal against White's light-squared Bishop.}  ( 12... Be6 $2  { Looks natural, developing the Bishop, but now it is a losing move, because of White's double threats against h6 and b7.}  13. Qc1  { Wins.}  ) 13. Bb4  { Immediately aiming at Black's weak dark squares and temporarily pinning Black's Knight.}  13... Be6 14. Qc1  { White cannot be happy about having moved the Queen three times just to reach this square.}  14... Bd5 $201  { To neutralize White's light-squared Bishop and pre-empt a White Nc5. White's position is rather unpromising. Black is the one with a grip on the center and a clear plan to expand on the Queen side with the b and c Pawns.}  15. a4  { White badly needs counterplay on the Queen side before Black takes it over himself.}  15... b6  { Planning to play c5 reaching a Maroczy Bind Pawn structure and shutting out White's dark-squared Bishop.}  ( 15... a5  { Immediately killing White's Queen side counterplay was possible. It does loosen up some Queen side squares, especially if Black continues with a Maroczy b6, c5 plan, but in these types of positions it can be worthwhile to squash White's a5 ideas that leads to White counterplay on the a file. The main drawback is that weakening b5 means that the plan of b5, c5, c4 then becomes impossible because of lack of connected Pawn support on b5. On the other hand, locking up the Queen side for good can sometimes allow Black to advance on the King side with f5 and so forth. Anand must have decided that preserving the b5, c5, c4 plan was best.}  ) 16. Bxe7  { Getting rid of the Bishop before it gets shut out.}  16... Qxe7 17. a5 Rab8  { Ceding the a file to White, but preventing simplification. Black wants to use the other Rook to support the thematic Pawn advances on the Queen side.}  18. Re1  { The e2 Pawn needed to be protected in case the Knight on e4 is driven away. Also, White wants to prepare for a thematic e3 eventually to challenge Black's center.}  18...

Qf4 Rd8  { Preventing an invasion on d6 while protecting d5.}  21. h4  { Preventing g5 by Black, which would drive White back for good and establish a bind on the King side while preparing the Queen side attack.}  21... Kh7  { Protecting the h6 Pawn to free up the Bishop on g7 to go to e5 to drive Black's Queen back.}  22. Nd2  { Trying to simplify but at a cost.}  22... Be5 23. Qg4 h5  { A committal choice, ceding the g5 square to White's Knight, but with the point of driving White back.}  24. Qh3 Be6 25. Qh1  { Wow, what a place for White's most powerful piece!}  25... c5 $201  { Maroczy Bind Pawn structure achieved. Now Black's plan is obvious: push b5, c4, aim to create a passed Pawn on c3. White's position is looking bad. All he has to go on is Black's weak g5 square, the White diagonal control, and a possible break on the e file. Is this enough for counterplay for a draw?}  26. Ne4 Kg7 27. Ng5  { Aiming to eventually simplify further, removing Black's Bishop pair advantage and reaching a position with opposite-colored Bishops.}  27... b5  { c4 is coming.}  28. e3 $5  { White goes wild, trying to neutralize Black's plan to create connected passed Pawns, even at the cost of losing a Pawn. The alternative was to wait and possibly get squeezed to death. It's a question of whether it was possible to wait patiently and defend. Carlsen clearly felt uncomfortable with that prospect.}  28... dxe3 29. Rxe3 Bd4 ( 29... Bxb2  { Why did Anand not just take the Pawn? Let's look at what happens with White counterplay on e6.}  30.

At this point, with so many possible open lines, I no longer trusted my judgment and finally used the computer for analysis. Computer thinks Black's advantage is no longer so great, presumably because Black's King is exposed.}  ( 33... Rf8  { Computer went for White's f2 Pawn. Still not clearly a win.}  ) 34. Rad1 Bxb2 $201  { And Black has won a Pawn.}  35. Qf3  { Finally reactivating the Queen. White will regain one of the two lost Pawns, by taking on d3, then try to get a Rook to d7 against Black's exposed King.}  35... Bf6 36. Rxd3 Rxd3 37.

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6  { Ah, the Berlin Defense, made infamous in the 2000 Kasparov-Kramnik match in which Kramnik revived the opening as a drawing weapon for Black.}  4. O-O Nxe4 5. d4 Nd6 6. Bxc6 dxc6 7. dxe5 Nf5 8. Qxd8+ Kxd8  { For those not familiar with this opening: Black accepts doubled Pawns, less space, an uncastled King, and a delay in development, all in return for the Bishop pair and Queen trade, challenging White to break through. Since Anand is known to play well with the Knight pair, I expect interesting maneuvering.}  9. h3 Bd7  { Beginning a currently popular plan of maneuvering the King to c8 and to b7  (  after b6  )  , while avoiding the light Bishop being a target, by being prepared to defend f7 with Be8 if necessary. Then Black will expand with c5 and then continue development. A very slow plan, but one that has been used effectively by many.}  10. Rd1 Be7 11. Nc3 Kc8 12. Bg5 h6 13. Bxe7 Nxe7 14. Rd2 c5  { Thematically trying to expand on the Queen side and free up the c6 square for a piece.}  15. Rad1 Be6  { A critical moment. White has finished developing, but how next to proceed? The thematic thing to do is to get the Pawns rolling with f4, g4, f5 eventually, while holding off Black's counterplay, which could come in the form of moves like g5, or even h5, h4, Rh5  (  as has happened in some classic Berlin Defense games  )  .}  ( 15... Bc6 $2 16. e6 fxe6  { Looks reasonable, but weakens the e6 square.}  17. Ne5  { A nice clearance sacrifice.}  ) 16. Ne1 $6  { The fundamental problem with a Knight in chess is that sometimes you have to go backwards in order to redeploy, but this temporarily takes time as well as cedes control of the squares the Knight formerly protected, for example the e5 Pawn. Anand wants to prepare f4 and/or move the Knight to d3, but this seems like a bad plan.}  16... Ng6  { Immediately taking advantage of the absence of White's Knight, attacking the e5 Pawn.}  ( 16... b6 17. f4 $2  { White's position looks really good, actually. Black's temporarily extra e6 Pawn is completely unprotected and White's Knight on e5 is a fantastic piece, and the other will come around to e2 and f4.}  ( 17. Nd3 $2 g5  { Black suddenly springs to life with a fantastic position. White must not get complacent in the Berlin Defense!}  ) 17... g5  { Black could play thematically to hurry up with getting the Queen Rook into action.

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6  { Carlsen is confident about using the Berlin Defense again.}  4. d3  { Anand chooses to avoid going into the Berlin endgame that he had trouble with in round 4. He chooses to fight in the middlegame instead. Note that White gets no opening advantage with this quiet continuation, so Anand is signaling that he wants to demonstrate that he is better than Carlsen in a complex middlegame, the way Carlsen earlier played innocuous openings as White in order to avoid special preparation.}  4...

Bh4  { A fairly thematic Closed Ruy Lopez middlegame has arisen that can be considered equal. Now the question is, who is better at maneuvering to create winning chances?}  12... Bxb3 13. axb3 $5  { Provocative. White accepts a long-term positional weakness of doubled b Pawns for hope of play on the half-open a file. White also has ideas of advancing to b4 to trying to create a bind on Black's Queen side.}  ( 13. Nxb3  { Natural, safe, but completely boring.}  ) 13...

Anand seems to like to maneuver Knights, although this backfired badly in round 4 when he moved his Knights aimlessly in the Berlin ending.}  15... Qe7  { With the idea of breaking the pin and activating the Queen by moving to e6, covering the d5 and f5 squares.}  16. Ndf1  { More Knight maneuvering by Anand.

Bxe3  { Removing White's potentially dangerous Knight.}  24. fxe3  { So White has voluntarily accepted doubled e Pawns, but for what? In this simplified position, things are not looking promising for Anand. White has a much looser Pawn structure, with the Pawn on d3 being a target, and the the doubled e Pawns are a long-term liability. Black can work toward c5 and c4 prying at White's d3 Pawn. Meanwhile, there is nothing White can really do to make use of the half-open f file. Anand has misplayed the middlegame up to this point. Carlsen has a dream weakness-free position.}  24...

Qc6  { Protecting the d6 Pawn.}  30. Qf5 $6  { Consistent with the aggressive hope of using the d file with the Rook, but risky.}  30... exd4 31. Rxd4  { Forced. Now the game is getting open. White is hoping to get in Rd5.}  31... Re5 32. Qf3 Qc7  { Now how can either side make progress? Black's weakest points, the b5 and d6 Pawns, are protected, and White's e4 and e3 Pawns are protected.}  33. Kh1 Qe7 34. Qg4 Kh7 35. Qf4 g6  { Nice. Black continues to improve his position, planning to move the King to g7 to protect the f7 Pawn. Also, there are possible ideas of advancing with h5.}  36. Kh2 Kg7 37.
