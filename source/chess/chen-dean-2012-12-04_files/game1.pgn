1.d4 d6 2.e4 Nf6 3.Bd3 {Something different! I aimed for a solid Ruy Lopez type of position.}
e5 4.c3 Be7 5.Nf3 Bg4 {%08DA} 6.O-O ( 6.h3 {Immediately kicking the Bishop was possible.}
Bh5 7.Be3 O-O 8.Nbd2 {White delaying castling has its advantages.}
{%08DA} ) O-O 7.h3 Bh5 {%08DA} 8.Nbd2 {?!} {Starting the Knight on a planned journey. But it blocks White's own dark Bishop.}
( 8.Be3 {Logical and best.} {%08DA} c5 ( 8...Nbd7 9.Nbd2 ) 9.Nbd2
{White has a very comfortable Ruy Lopez setup.} {%08DA} ) c6
{?} {Actually loses a Pawn, but I was so bent on development that I didn't go for it.}
{%09DB} 9.Re1 ( 9.g4 {Wins the e5 Pawn.} {%08DA} ) Nbd7 10.Nf1
{The plan is to get the Knight to g3. But this is slow.} {%08DA}
d5 {!?} {An interesting idea, but was not followed up well.}
( 10...exd4 11.cxd4 d5 12.e5 Ne4 {A sound sacrifice.} {%08DA} )
11.exd5 e4 {?} {Thi sacrifice was just unsound.} ( 11...exd4
12.dxc6 bxc6 13.cxd4 {White is simply a Pawn up.} )
( 11...Nxd5 {The best option.} 12.dxe5 Qc7 13.Ne3 Nxe3 14.Bxe3
Bxf3 15.Qxf3 Nxe5 16.Qf4 Bd6 17.Bc2 {Material is even but White has the two Bishops and an advantage.}
{%08DA} ) 12.Bxe4 {?} {Justifying Black's play, unfortunately.}
{%09DB} ( 12.dxc6 {This Zwischenzug (in-between move) gives White a clear advantage. I can't believe I didn't play it.}
{%08DA} Bxf3 ( 12...exf3 13.g4 {Black is lost.} {%08DA} ) 13.gxf3
exd3 14.cxd7 Qxd7 15.Qxd3 {White is up material. I assume it is a won game for White.}
{%08DA} ) Nxe4 13.Rxe4 cxd5 14.Re1 {
The dust has cleared and Black has compensation for the sacrificed Pawn similar
to that in the Marshall Attack of the Ruy Lopez. Black has achieved the two Bishops while White is behind in development.}
{%08DA} Bd6 {%08DA} 15.g4 {!?} {Very ambitious but loosening.}
( 15.Ne3 {Safe and strong.} {%08DA} Nb6 ( 15...Nf6 16.Nf5 {White is doing great.}
{%08DA} ) 16.Nf5 {Black is in bad shape.} {%08DA} ) Bg6 16.Ne5
{?} {Very loosening.} ( 16.Bg5 {Developing with tempo was good. It was my original plan, but I didn't play it.}
f6 17.Bh4 {The idea is that after Bg3, White is all defended on the King side.}
{%08DA} ) Nxe5 {?} {Trading errors.} ( 16...Bxe5 17.dxe5 Nc5
{Black has compensation for the Pawn down, because of White's weak light squares.}
{%08DA} ) 17.dxe5 {
At the point in the game, I was very happy, and considered that the game should
probably be winnable by White. Black still has compensation, with the two Bishops, however.}
{%08DA} Bc7 18.Bf4 {!?} ( 18.Ne3 {Going immediately for Black's d Pawn was most logical and transposes.}
{%08DA} ) Re8 {!?} {Transposes into the line I had planned all along.}
( 18...Qd7 {%08DA} 19.Ng3 Rad8 20.Qb3 {%08DA} ) 19.Ne3 {Liquidating into an endgame, but winning chances are low.}
( 19.Bg3 {!?} {I considered maintaining the tension. In retrospect, it was a better attempt for a win.}
{%08DA} Bb6 20.Ne3 d4 21.cxd4 Bxd4 22.Qb3 {White has good winning chances here.}
{%08DA} ) Bxe5 20.Nxd5 Bxf4 21.Nxf4 Be4 22.Qxd8 Raxd8 {A critical position.}
{%08DA} 23.Re3 {?} {Ceding all advantage, really. It should be a draw now.}
( 23.Rad1 {Obvious and fine, my original plan.} {%08DA} Bc6 24.Rxe8+
Rxe8 {Black may be able to draw this, because of the strong Bishop.}
{%08DA} ) Bc6 {%08DA} 24.Rae1 {?} {Terrible. After playing this move, I suddenly realized that the Black Bishop was much more powerful than my Knight.}
( 24.Rxe8+ Rxe8 25.Rd1 {It's probably a draw, but completely safe for White, who is a Pawn up. I should have just gone for this draw.}
{%08DA} ) Rxe3 25.fxe3 {?} {Terrible. Giving up the draw for a possible loss.}
( 25.Rxe3 Rd1+ 26.Kh2 {%08DA} Rh1+ 27.Kg3 Rg1+ 28.Kh4 f6 {White cannot make any progress with such a bad King position.}
{%08DA} ) g5 {%08DA} 26.Nh5 Rd2 {%08DA} 27.e4 {??} {A losing plan. The b Pawn cannot really be lost.}
( 27.b4 Rg2+ 28.Kf1 {White still has chances to draw.} {%08DA} )
Rxb2 28.Rd1 {?} {This does not work.} Kf8 29.Nf6 h6 {White's attack is over, and his Pawns are all weak.}
{%08DA} 30.Nd5 {?} a5 {Precise play by Black. The game is over.}
{%08DA} 31.e5 {?} {Desperate junk.} Rxa2 32.Ne3 Re2
( 32...a4 {Wins faster.} {%08DA} ) 33.Nf5 Rxe5 34.Nxh6 {%08DA}
Be4 35.Rf1 Bg6 36.Kg2 Kg7 37.Nf5+ Bxf5 38.gxf5 {Now we have a Rook and Pawn ending that is lost for White.}
{%08DA} Kf6 {?} ( 38...a4 ) 39.c4 {%08DA} b5 {??} {Wow, giving White chances again.}
( 39...a4 ) 40.cxb5 Rxb5 41.Ra1 Rxf5 {%08DA} 42.Ra4 Ke6 43.Kg3
Kd6 44.Ra1 f6 45.h4 gxh4+ 46.Kxh4 {Black has played sufficiently inaccurately that White may be back in the game.}
{%08DA} Kc6 47.Kg4 Rc5 48.Kf3 Rc3+ 49.Ke4 Kb5 {?} {%08DA} 50.Kd4
Rc4+ {A critical moment.} {%08DA} 51.Kd5 {??} {
Ridiculous losing move, because White's King is now out of play, instead of
heading toward the back rank to prevent an invasion. The rest of the game is garbage.}
( 51.Kd3 {This should draw. Black is shut out of making further progress.}

Rc2 {%08DA}
{An uneven game featuring an interesting sacrifice of a Pawn by Black, in the
spirit of the Marshall Attack. White did consolidate, but then went astray in
the ending. However, Black did allow White a draw at one point in the ending, but White blew it. A traumatic game.} 0-1
