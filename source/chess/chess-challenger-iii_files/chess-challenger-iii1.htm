I was in the 2nd grade and the lunch proctor heard that I played chess, because I liked to look at kids' chess books in the classroom library. She brought in a new Chess Challenger III chess computer during recess and let me play with it. This was the first and last time I ever played against this computer.   </p>

To my surprise and shock, instead of being happy and proud of me, she scolded me for lying and said there was no way that I could be winning against this expensive computer she just paid thousands of dollars for. I never again saw the computer and never asked for a rematch. I knew I was right that I was winning in this position.</span>

It was exciting for me as a 7-year-old to be winning a chess game against a computer. At this point in my life, I still had never won a game against my father (I would not win a game with him until age 11).&#13;&#10;       <P CLASS="S19">

Unfortunately, this was not the first time I had a negative encounter with an adult who was incompetent and mean to me.         </p>
