{So after I won a game against one boy and then his brother, they wanted me to
play against their father. I was wary, not knowing how good he might be, but I was determined to play an interesting game.} 1.Nf3
Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 b6 {?!} {Trying for a Queen's Indian setup, but the move order is inaccurate.}
4.e4 {!} {White gets e4 in already, which is very difficult in a Queen's Indian.}
Bb7 5.Bd3 {!} d5 {?} {Played after a long think, but not so good because it allows White to attack with e5.}
( 5...d6 {Going for a Hedgehog for Black may be the best option, but White gets a more
favorable version of it than usual because e4 was managed without difficulty
and White's Bishop is better placed protecting e4.} 6.Bc2 c5

{White has some advantage because of more space and opportunities for a King side attack.}
) 9.Qc2 {?!} {
A tricky move, but objectively not good. The point is to threaten Black's light
squares e6, g6, and h7, but Black could have ignored the "threat" and played
for the center. In a tournament game, I would have played more correctly, but
for party entertainment purposes, I had anticipated Black's reply, as a matter
of psychology based on how he had played in the game so far.}
( 9.Bc2 {Natural and good, preparing d4.} O-O 10.d4 c5 11.Be3

Up to this point, I had played at blitz speed. Here I entered a long think,
looking for the quickest forced win I was sure existed. I was proud of finding
this move and its entire followup to the end of the game, especially given that
I was at a party surrounded by children running around and hovering and
spilling potato chip crumbs on the chess board that I had to wipe repeatedly!}
12.Nd4 {!} Nc5 {%08DA} 13.b4 e5 14.bxc5 exd4 15.Qf5+ Bf6 16.Ba3
{The move that my opponent missed. It was very cute to suddenly activate my
locked up Bishop without ever having to move my d Pawn. Black is completely lost now.}

I saw that simplification wins, so I went for it to save time since I was
hungry and wanted to eat more barbecue and socialize at the party.}

23.Rac1 {If the Knight moves, then Rxc7+ wins a piece. So Black resigned.}
{%08DA} {I was very excited that this game quickly resulted in a unique position with a
lot of tactics, and that I calculated correctly.} 1-0
