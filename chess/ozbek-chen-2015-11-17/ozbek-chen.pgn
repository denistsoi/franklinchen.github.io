22. a3 { Creating a target for Black to attack.}  22... Qa4 { Of course hitting
the a-Pawn.}  23. Ra1 Rc7 24. Rec1 Rfc8 { Black has considerable pressure on
White's weak Queen side Pawns and can try to break through and win one of the
Pawns eventually.}  25. h3 { Waiting move to prevent back rank stuff.}  25...
Qb3 $6 ( 25... Bd8 { Rerouting the Bishop was best.} ) 26. Nd4 $2 { Not the
best place for the Knight.}  ( 26. Nd2 { The right square, keeping Black out of
c4.} ) 26... Qc4 27. Qd2 Qa6 { Confused about the best plan, I decided to wait
for a mistake and redeploy my Rook.}  ( 27... a5) 28. Ra2 $2 { Leaving the back
rank weak. This will become important.}  28... Rc4 { Now Black can think about
redeploying the dark Bishop to d8 and b6 to hit the White Knight on d4.}  29.
Rac2 $4 { Seemingly a trap  (  and it worked in the game  )  , but actually a
losing blunder. Is the a-Pawn poisoned?}  29... Qxa3 { Taking the "poisoned"
Pawn was the right move, but not played with enough thought.}  30. Ra2 $4 { Is
Black's Queen trapped?}  30... Rxd4 $6 { I thought this was clever and played
it way too quickly, thinking I won.}  ( 30... Bg5 $1 { I missed the big win!!
This wins because White's Queen is overloaded and has to protect too many
pieces: the Rook on a2, the Rook on c1, and the Knight on d4.}  31. f4 ( 31.
Rxa3 Bxd2 32. Rd1 Bxc3 { White will eventually end up 3 Pawns down and dead
lost.}  ) 31... Bxf4 32. Qxf4 { Loses the Rook on a2.}  32... Qxa2 ) 31. Qc2 {
A critical moment. I was in shock because I had not considered that my Queen
really was trapped.}  ( 31. cxd4 $4 { Loses the Rook on c1.}  31... Qxc1+ ) (
31. Qxd4 $4 { Also loses the Rook on c1.}  31... Qxc1+ ) 31... Qxc3 $2 { I
chickened out and played for the draw because I was suddenly scared of White's
Queen and wanted her off.}  ( 31... Qxc1+ $1 { I should have sacrificed my
Queen while getting a very strong, probably winning attack with the two Rooks
and Bishop.}  32. Qxc1 Bxb4 { Black should be able to defend the King against
the White Queen and Rook while creating threats against White's King.}  33. Qb2
( 33. Rxa7 $4 { This is a natural continuation that happens to lose because
White's Rook ends up useless and out of play.}  33... Bxc3 34. Rxb7 Re4 {
Threatening to win White's Queen with a check on the back rank. Black's Bishop
is very powerful.}  35. Qa3 Re1+ 36. Kh2 Re2 37. f4 { Trying to save the e5 and
f2 Pawns fails.}  37... Bd2 38. Qf3 Re4 39. g3 Rc3 40. Qh5 g6 41. Qd1 Be1 { The
end is near. White's King is exposed, and White's entire dark Pawn chain is
going to be lost.}  ) 33... Rxc3 34. Rxa7 Rdc4 { Black has an advantage, but
needs to be careful about White's Queen.}  35. Rxb7 $4 Rc2 36. Qb3 Bc5 { Black
has a winning attack.}  ) 32. Qxc3 Rxc3 33. Rxc3 Bxb4 34. Rc8+ Kh7 35. Rxa7
Rd1+ { The game continued with many errors on both sides until a draw was
reached.}   1/2-1/2
