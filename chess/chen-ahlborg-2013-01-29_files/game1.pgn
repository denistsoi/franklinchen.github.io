1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 e5 3.g3 c6 4.d4 exd4 5.Qxd4 Be7 {?!} {Very passive. Black will have problems with his d Pawn.}
{%08DA} ( 5...d5 {Normal.} ) 6.Bg2 d6 7.Nf3 Nbd7 8.O-O Nc5 9.e4
{?} {Premature, actually, because the Pawn becomes a target.}
( 9.b4 {I did look at the most aggressive continuation, but decided to play a slow game instead.}
Ne6 10.Qd3 {%08DA} ) O-O 10.b3 {?!} {Loosening. After playing this, I realized that I was moving too quickly in the opening.}
( 10.Rd1 {Most natural.} ) Qc7 {?!} {Now White's reckless move order is justified.}
( 10...Ng4 {Going for Bf6 was strongest.} ) 11.Bb2 {Now White is OK.}
Re8 {?!} {Too passive.} ( 11...a5 {Black is fine after this thematic counterplay on the Queen side.}
) 12.Rfe1 Bf8 {?!} {Passive.} 13.Rad1 {
At this point, White has completed basic development and has a good game.
Black's position is solid, however, and hard to crack.} {%08DA}
Ng4 {?} {The first truly poor move by either side. Black wants to get the Knight to e5, but it is not actually so well placed there.}
{%08DA} ( 13...a5 {It was still not too late for Black to look for Queen side counterplay.}
{%08DA} ) 14.Nh4 {!} {
The star move, guaranteeing White an advantage. I spent 14 minutes thinking
before deciding that getting the Knight to f5 was the best plan.}
{%08DA} a6 {?} {Aiming at counterplay with b5, but this is not really going to happen.}
15.Nf5 {Threatening both Nxg7 and Nxd6.} {%08DA} Bxf5 16.exf5
{White has a real advantage now, with control of d5 and pressure against the d6
Pawn, has the two Bishops, with the light squared Bishop on g2 activated, and
control of e6. Black can really only try to simplify into an ending.}
{%08DA} Rxe1+ 17.Rxe1 Ne5 18.Re3 {
White has protected everything and can start thinking of attacking the King
side with moves such as f4 and g4 with preparation. Black's defensive task is difficult.}
{%08DA} b5 {??!} {
This looks like a terrible move, losing a Pawn for nebulous activity, but did
have the virtue of shaking things up and making White rethink how to win the game.}
19.cxb5 axb5 20.Nxb5 Qb8 {White is really just a solid Pawn up.}
{%08DA} 21.Nc3 {The obvious defensive move holds.}
( 21.Nxd6 {?} {After the game, Black said that he had looked at this sacrifice, which promises nothing for White.}
{%08DA} ) Qc8 {%09DB} 22.g4 Qa6 23.Bf1 {Simple and safe, and also with ideas of redeploying the Bishop.}
( 23.g5 {!} {There was not really a threat for a Knight to go to d3, because White has the Bf1 as a pin.}
{%08DA} ) Qa7 {%08DA} 24.Be2 {
Not bad, but slow given that there was an immediate win. I knew I was going to
play g5 eventually, but wanted to "prepare" first.}
( 24.g5 {!} {A immediate g5 was already winning, shutting off all Black counterplay and aiming to invade the King side.}
{%08DA} Qb7 {?} {An example continuation to illustrate White's attack. There really aren't any good moves for Black anyway.}
25.Qh4 {Black is defenseless against White's f4 and Rh3.} {%08DA} )
Qb8 25.Kg2 {
Still "waiting". I decided I wanted my King on a safer square to avoid tactics
from a Knight check or from Black's Bishop possibly getting to c5 somehow.}
( 25.g5 {!} {Again, this wins immediately. Below is just a sample line illustrating the power of White's attack.}
{%08DA} Qc8 26.f4 Ned7 27.b4 Na6 28.g6 {%08DA} hxg6 29.fxg6 {White will blast through by getting the Bishop to c4 and sacrificing on d5 if necessary to bring the King out to the open.}
{%08DA} ) Ncd7 {?} {Clearly trying to play c5, but this does not really help Black.}
26.g5 {!} {Finally! White has a won game but must be careful. The plan is to get the Queen to h4.}
{%08DA} d5 {A nice try at activity, to get the Bishop out to c5.}
{%08DA} 27.Na4 {?!} {
Missing the clearest win. But during the whole game I was bent on preventing
counterplay rather than on necessarily playing the strongest moves.}
{%08DA} ( 27.Rh3 {!} {Just going for the King immediately was strongest.}
Bc5 28.Qh4 Nf8 {%08DA} 29.Na4 Bd6 30.Bc3 c5 31.f4 Ned7 32.f6
{%08DA} ) f6 {??} {This weakening move loses.} 28.gxf6 gxf6 {%08DA}
29.Qh4 {?!} {Throwing away the fastest win. I was fixated on getting the Queen to h4 and opening the way for the dark Bishop.}
( 29.f4 Nf7 30.Rg3+ Bg7 31.Nc5 {A very clear and clean win against Black's exposed King.}
{%08DA} ) Qd8 {??} ( 29...Bg7 {Necessary.} 30.Bxe5 fxe5 31.Rh3
{Black will lose the h Pawn and eventually the game, but at least has some chances with the center Pawn mass.}
{%08DA} h6 32.Rg3 {%08DA} ) 30.Bh5 {!} {
This is why I played Bf1 and Be2 all along, hoping to eventually use it on h5.
The game should be over now. The Bishop controls f7 and e8 and might even go to g6. Black will lose a Knight no matter what.}
{%08DA} c5 {??!} {In effect giving up a piece to blunt White's attack. From a practical standpoint clearly the best try.}
( 30...Bh6 31.f4 Kh8 32.Rg3 {Black's Knight on e5 is trapped.}
{%08DA} ) 31.f4 d4 32.Rg3+ Kh8 33.fxe5 Nxe5 {
White clearly has a wonn game, but both players are starting to get low on
time. All White has to do is defend against any possible Pawn advances,
consolidate, and bring the pieces over to the King side.} {%08DA}
34.Bf3 Ra6 35.Qe4 {White is simply regrouping pieces back toward the center.}
Bd6 {??} 36.Be2 {?} {Missing the immediate win.} ( 36.Qb7 {Wins with double attack against g7 for mate and the Rook on a6.}
{%08DA} ) Ra7 37.Bc1 {?} {Trying to activate the Bishop, but slow and inaccurate.}
( 37.Kf1 {Getting the King out of danger and providing a retreat for the Rook was most accurate.}
{%08DA} ) Re7 {%08DA} 38.Qh4 {??} {
White has truly lost the thread here. The win is now in some doubt. But both
players were down to less than five minutes for the rest of the game, and we were no longer keeping score.}
{%08DA} Rf7 {??} ( 38...Nd7 {Wins back an exchange. Oops!} {%08DA} )
39.Bh5 {Back in control, whew!} Qa8+ {??} {Just a random check, but takes Black's Queen away from King side defense.}
40.Kg1 Rf8 41.Bh6 {Finally the game is totally over, winnable on autopilot. The rest of the moves were just blitzed out.}
{%08DA} Nd7 42.Bg7+ Kg8 {%08DA} 43.Bxf8+ {?} {Missed an immediate mate, but in time pressure, who cares?}
( 43.Bxf6+ Bxg3 44.Qxg3# {%08DA} ) Bxg3 44.Qxg3+ Kxf8 45.Qd6+
Kg8 46.Qxd7 {OK, mission accomplished: it doesn't matter how little time is on the clock, because White can win this with no time at all.}
{%08DA} c4 47.Qf7+ Kh8 48.Qxf6+ Kg8 49.Bf7+ Kf8 50.Bg6+ Kg8 51.Qf7+
Kh8 52.Qxh7# {%08DA}
{I thought I played a pretty good game, pressing with an attack all the way
from the beginning of the middle game. There were some inaccuracies, but overall Black suffered a lot.} 1-0
