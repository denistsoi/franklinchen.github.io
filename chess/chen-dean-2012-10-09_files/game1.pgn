{I knew this game was going to be tense. My opponent and I were playing this
final game in the tournament to determine who would win first prize.} 1.d4
d6 2.e4 Nf6 3.Nc3 Nbd7 4.Nf3 e5 {We have transposed to the Philidor.}
{%08DA} 5.Bc4 Be7 6.O-O O-O 7.a4 c6 8.Re1 {%08DA} exd4 {I was surprised to see Black give away the center so quickly.}
9.Nxd4 Ne5 10.Ba2 Ne8 11.f4 {I knew this was potentially weakening of my King side, but I was feeling impatiently aggressive, and I believed this was best.}
{%08DA} Ng6 12.Be3 Nc7 13.Qh5 {Again very aggressive.} {%08DA}
Bf6 14.Rad1 Bxd4 15.Rxd4 {%08DA} Be6 {?} {Black is really in a lot of trouble now.}
{%08DA} 16.Red1 {?} {Starting to go astray. My (correct) sense that White had an overwhelming position made me get careless.}
( 16.Bb1 {Avoiding the exchange is very strong because of the f5 threat. I saw this obvious candidate move but bizarre did not play it.}
{%08DA} ) Bxa2 17.Rxd6 {?} {Unbelievably, I played this without thought. I somehow thought the game was already over, that I had won a Pawn.}
( 17.Nxa2 {The natural retake leaves White still with an advantage.}
{%08DA} ) Qe8 {
At this point, I got very depressed. I realized that I had lost all advantage
and might even be losing already. I thought for 17 minutes and played into weird complications.}
{%08DA} 18.f5 {?} {I missed Black's reply.} ( 18.Qe2 {A sane move protecting the Bishop at e3.}
Be6 19.f5 {The position is equal.} {%08DA} ) Nd5 {!} {Nice, taking advantage of the unprotected Bishop on e3.}
19.Nxd5 Bxd5 20.fxg6 hxg6 {
White is about to lose a Pawn. The only hope is to play for a draw, taking
advantage of the opposite-colored Bishops and Black's extra Pawn being a doubled g-Pawn.}
{%08DA} 21.Qf3 {?} {Not the best way to lose the Pawn.}
( 21.Qh4 {The easy way to draw.} {%08DA} Qxe4 ( 21...Bxe4 22.Re1
f5 23.c3 {Easy draw for White.} {%08DA} ) 22.Qxe4 Bxe4 {This should be an easy draw for White.}
{%08DA} ) Bxe4 22.Qf2 {A critical position. It turns out that Black can win a second Pawn here.}
{%08DA} Qe5 {Declining to win the c Pawn. Perhaps a good practical decision because White was getting into time trouble already.}
( 22...Bxc2 23.Re1 Bf5 24.Bxa7 {I believe White should be able to hold a draw.}
{%08DA} ) 23.R6d2 {!} {I had to find this defensive move, rescuing the Rook from being trapped.}
{%08DA} ( 23.c3 {?} {My opponent expected me to play this move, but it is actually bad.}
Bd5 {White's Rook is in trouble.} {%08DA} 24.Rd7 ( 24.Bf4 Qe4
25.a5 Qa4 {White is clearly losing.} {%08DA} ) b6 {White's Rook will be trapped.}
{%08DA} ) Qxb2 {%08DA} 24.Bxa7 {?!} {My idea was to lock down the dark squares in order to secure a draw, but this idea should have failed.}
{%08DA} Bf5 {?!} {Avoiding hunting down the a Pawn immediately.}
( 24...Qa2 {%08DA} 25.Rd7 Qxc2 26.Qxc2 Bxc2 27.R1d2 Rxa7 28.Rxc2
Rfa8 {With the simplification, White should be able to hold.}
{%08DA} ) 25.h3 {?} Qa2 {%08DA} 26.Qd4 {%08DA} Rfe8 {?} {Allowing White to escape.}
( 26...Rfd8 {%08DA} 27.Qxd8+ Rxd8 28.Rxd8+ Kh7 {I'm not entirely sure whether White can hold. Probably, but no fun.}
{%08DA} ) 27.Ra1 {White is starting to protect everything.} {%08DA}
Qe6 28.Bb6 {
Offering a draw! Finally executing the setup behind the decision made at Qf3
and then Qf2. White can draw this position. The only problem is time pressure.}
{%08DA} Qe4 {Declining the draw offer.} 29.c3 ( 29.Qxe4 {Taking the Queens off would have saved some trouble.}
Rxe4 30.a5 {%08DA} ) Qe7 30.a5 Qg5 31.Kh2 Re4 32.Qf2 Be6 {Black has managed to improve his position after not trading Queens!}
{%08DA} 33.Rd4 {?} Re5 {?} ( 33...Qe5+ {Was strong!} {%08DA} )
34.Rad1 Re8 35.R1d2 Bd5 36.Qh4 {?!} {Finally wanting to get the Queens off, but not best.}
( 36.c4 {Was actually good in this position.} {%08DA} Be6 37.Bc7
Rf5 38.Qg3 Qxg3+ 39.Kxg3 {Clearly a draw, with White's very active Pawns and pieces.}
{%08DA} ) Qxh4 37.Rxh4 Re2 38.Rxe2 Rxe2 39.Rg4 {Although this looks to be drawn, White's task is not entirely trivial, because of the weak Queen side Pawns.}
{%08DA} Be4 40.Kg1 Bd3 41.Rd4 Ba6 {OK, White is happy now.} {%08DA}
42.c4 {?} {Not necessary.} Rc2 43.c5 ( 43.Rd8+ {There was a tactical shot against Black's King side here.}
Kh7 44.Rd7 f6 45.Bc5 Rxc4 46.Bf8 Kg8 47.Bxg7 f5 {%08DA} ) Re2
44.Kh2 Rc2 45.Kg1 f6 46.h4 {This obvious move should have been played earlier because Black could have played g5. But better late than never.}
{%08DA} Re2 47.Kh2 Re3 48.Rd7 Kh7 {%08DA} 49.g3 {?} {No reason for this move preventing White from going to g3 with the King.}
Re2+ 50.Kg1 Kh6 51.Rd4 {?} {In terrible time pressure, faltering. Both sides are in time pressure.}
{%08DA} g5 52.Bc7 {?} {This is the last move I wrote down. I cannot guarantee that the rest of the moves are correct.}
{%08DA} gxh4 53.Rxh4+ Kg6 54.Rd4 Kf5 55.Bd8 Re8 56.Kf2 g5 {?}
{Now the draw is obvious.} 57.g4+ Kg6 58.Rd6 {%08DA} Rf8 59.Kg3
Rf7 60.Kh3 Be2 61.Kg3 Bc4 62.Kh3 Be2 {
This is the actual final position when Black finally counter-offered a draw. We
had actually shuffled pieces around a dozen or so times at some point from move
53 before arriving at this final position. It was really tough for me to
recover from losing a Pawn early in the middle game and trying to hang in there
for the draw, but I was proud that I made it, even if along the way there were
inaccuracies that could have gotten me in more trouble.} {%08DA}
{A very intense game. It was the last game to finish, taking about four hours
and fifteen minutes of wall clock time. Both of us had less than two minutes
left on the clock when my opponent finally took the draw rather than continue on. We tied for first in the tournament.} 1/2-1/2
