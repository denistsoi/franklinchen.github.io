{This was the first time I had ever met my opponent and played with him. It's always exciting to play someone new.} 1.e4
c5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.f4 {So, a Grand Prix Attack by White.} g6 4.Nf3
Bg7 5.Bb5 Nd4 6.Bd3 d6 7.Nxd4 cxd4 8.Ne2 Nh6 {!?} {I deliberately went for this funny-looking move in order to create a more unusual position than usual, playing for f5.}
( 8...Nf6 {Normal and good. Either way, Black has equality.}
{%08DA} ) 9.c3 {%09DB} dxc3 10.bxc3 {Capturing toward the center, an interesting choice.}
( 10.dxc3 O-O {Black is just slightly better.} {%08DA} ) O-O
{%09DB} 11.O-O f5 {?!} {
Objectively this is not such a great plan, because of considerable weakening of
squares, but I wanted to create a dynamic position.} {%08DA}
12.Bc4+ {?} {Justifying Black's play, unprotecting the e4 Pawn without a good reason.}
( 12.Qb3+ Kh8 {White is better.} {%08DA} ) Kh8 13.exf5 Nxf5
( 13...d5 {It was possible to block up the center with equality, and I did consider it, but I wanted to be more ambitious and try for e5.}
{%08DA} ) 14.d4 {?} {Playing into Black's plans. White is still not worse, but his position is starting to become loose.}
{%09DB} {%08DA} Bd7 {!?} {Deciding to wait before committing to e5.}
( 14...e5 {Immediate e5 was possible, but I decided to wait.}
{%08DA} ) 15.Bd2 {?} {
And waiting paid off, because White immediately starts to finally get a worse
position. This very passive move does little for White's game.}
{%08DA} e5 {Boom, Black is better. I was truly happy for the first time in the game.}
{%08DA} 16.fxe5 {?} {
From bad to wrose. Black's weak Pawns are being liquidated and the position is
opening in Black's favor. Black's pieces are already better placed.}
dxe5 {%08DA} 17.d5 {??} {This actually loses already, but I didn't see the win!}
{%08DA} b5 {?!} {Missing the immediate win.} ( 17...Qb6+ 18.Kh1
Nd6 19.Bb3 ( 19.Bd3 e4 20.Bc2 e3 21.Bc1 Rxf1+ 22.Qxf1 Rf8 23.Qe1
Qc5 {White is positionally lost.} {%08DA} ) Ne4 {%08DA} ) 18.Bb3
Qb6+ {A similar idea to the fast win.} 19.Kh1 e4 {
A very important move. Black has to be very quick to take advantage of better
development, before White can consolidate and equalize.} {%08DA}
20.Rf4 {?} {
An ill-advised attempt to be active. The main problem is that White's Rook
becomes a target. At this point I started thinking of possible ways to trap White's Rook.}
( 20.Bg5 {A paradoxical move that is actually White's best.}
{%08DA} h6 21.Bd2 e3 22.Be1 Nd6 23.Nf4 Nc4 {Black may still be winning, but the task is not easy.}
{%08DA} ) e3 {Again, despite the risk of overextending, it is important at some point for Black to press on with the attack.}
{%09DB} {%08DA} 21.Bc1 {%08DA} Rae8 {
Developing the final piece and overprotecting the e3 Pawn, in preparation for
the final attack on White. White is basically lost at this point. There is
nothing White can do about Black's threats on the entire board.}
{%08DA} 22.a4 {Maybe the best active try, but I had anticipated it from the moment that White played Rf4.}
{%08DA} g5 {!} {
The critical last component of Black's attack! Not only kicking White back, but
also opening the way for Qh6 to complete the King side attack against White.}
{%08DA} 23.Rg4 {??} {Falling victim to a trap.} ( 23.Rf1 b4 {Black is clearly winning.}
{%08DA} ) ( 23.Rf3 b4 {Black is winning.} {%08DA} )
( 23.Rb4 Nh4 {%08DA} 24.axb5 Rf2 ) ( 23.a5 Qh6 24.Rf1 Be5 {%08DA} )
Nd6 {White is going to lose the Rook now!} {%08DA} 24.Rxg5 Ne4
{White might as well resign here, but for some reason did not.}
{%08DA} 25.Rh5 Nf2+ 26.Kg1 Nxd1 27.Bc2 {I actually sat there for a minute or two in disbelief as White continued on.}
{%08DA} Qf6 ( 27...Rf1+ {Cute forced mate in 10 (!), but I didn't bother looking for this.}
{%08DA} 28.Kxf1 Qf6+ 29.Bf5 Bxf5 30.Bxe3 Bd3+ 31.Kg1 Rxe3 32.Rxd1
Rxe2 33.Kh1 Qf2 34.Rxh7+ Bxh7 35.Rg1 Re1 36.Rxe1 Qxe1# {%08DA} )
28.Ng3 {%09DB} Qf2+ {Mate in 2.} {%08DA}
{This was a longish game, lasting three hours. The positions achieved were
unusual and fascinating to me, and I tried to think calmly in order to play
accurately. I was fairly happy with this game, other than the fact that I did
gamble a bit in the opening to achieve a dynamic imbalance that objectively
should not have been in my favor, and the fact that I missed a much faster win earlier.} 0-1
