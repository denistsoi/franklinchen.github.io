{I was in the 2nd grade and the lunch proctor heard that I played chess,
because I liked to look at kids' chess books in the classroom library. She
brought in a new Chess Challenger III chess computer during recess and let me
play with it. This was the first and last time I ever played against this computer.} 1.e4
c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 g6 5.Nc3 Bg7 6.Be3 Nf6 7.Bc4 Qa5
{This move confused me because the threat against e4 seemed too easy to defend
against, and I had heard that it was not good to move the Queen out too early in a chess game.}
8.O-O Qb4 {?} {
I was a little worried after seeing this move. How could I protect the b Pawn
and the Bishop at c4 and also watch out for discoveries against my Knight at
d4? But after some thought, I realized that I was actually safe.}
9.Qe2 {I deliberately left the b Pawn unprotected.} Qxb2 {??}
{The computer did not realize that the b Pawn was poisoned!}
{%08DA} 10.Ncb5 {I had calculated that the Queen would be trapped.}
{%08DA} Nxe4 11.Rab1 Nxd4 {?} {Just giving up the Queen.}
( 11...Nc3 {Would have been the best continuation, avoiding losing the Queen.}
12.Rxb2 Nxe2+ 13.Bxe2 {White is winning, with one piece for two Pawns.}
) 12.Bxd4 Bxd4 ( 12...Qxd4 13.Nxd4 Nc3 14.Qe3 Nxb1 15.Nb5 O-O
16.Rxb1 {White is winning, of course, anyway, with a Queen for a Rook and two Pawns.}
) 13.Rxb2 Bxb2 14.Qxe4 {
Unfortunately, at this very moment, lunch recess was over, and the lunch
proctor came to take back her computer. I protested, excitedly saying that I
was winning. To my surprise and shock, instead of being happy and proud of me,
she scolded me for lying and said there was no way that I could be winning
against this expensive computer she just paid thousands of dollars for. I never
again saw the computer and never asked for a rematch. I knew I was right that I was winning in this position.}
{%08DA} {It was exciting for me as a 7-year-old to be winning a chess game against a
computer. At this point in my life, I still had never won a game against my
father (I would not win a game with him until age 11).
 
 Unfortunately, this
was not the first time I had a negative encounter with an adult who was mean to me.} 1-0
