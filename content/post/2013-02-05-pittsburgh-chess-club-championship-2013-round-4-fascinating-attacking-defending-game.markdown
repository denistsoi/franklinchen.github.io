Round 4 of the annual [Pittsburgh Chess Club](http://pittsburghcc.org/) Championship had me playing one of the most *fascinating* games I have played in my entire life. My opponent tried to wipe me off the board with a brute-force attack in the early moves of the opening and I managed to defend, but there were various subtleties involved. He engaged in *sacrifice* after sacrifice, not all sound, but all interesting.

## My complete annotated game

At your convenience, you can [enjoy playing over the game with my annotations, including diagrams](/chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05.htm).

**In fact, it is necessary to read the detailed annotations to get a full picture of all the best moves that neither player saw but existed.**

## Preparation

As I mentioned in [my report on the previous round](/blog/2013/02/03/pittsburgh-chess-club-championship-2013-round-3-attack-defense-and-sacrifices/), I knew that for today, I would face Peter Jansen (currently rated 1999), and that I know how he plays the openings. I knew that he tries to play solidly for a draw against stronger players, so I had to figure out a way to maximize my winning chances. I planned a particular *ultra-aggressive* opening as Black against him, the [Dutch Defense](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Defence), the goal of which is avoid early contact while preparing to stake out a claim in the center as well as on the King side.

In particular, I remembered that some years ago, Peter had been White against Grandmaster [Alexander Shabalov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Shabalov) (who is a four-time winner of the US Chess Championship, and also happens to live in Squirrel Hill in Pittsburgh) and Shabalov had used the Dutch as Black against him. (Actually, I had misremembered the occasion as a simultaneous exhibition; after our game, when I told Peter about my preparation, he said that the game had been an actual tournament game. I looked and verified that it was a [Pittsburgh Chess League game in 2007](http://www.uschess.org/assets/msa_joomla/XtblMain.php?200710142921.1-12533530).)

## Overview of my game

### The opening

Peter played *exactly* as I predicted he would, and we reached a position that I had concluded was fine for Black. After playing `h6` to kick White's Bishop, I fully expected a retreat and then a slow progression to an interesting middlegame:

{{< figure src="/chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05_files/diag3FA63606B7AA25D9.gif" title="Dutch after h6" >}}

Instead, Peter uncorked a series of remarkable disruptive sacrificial ideas!

First, he did not retreat the Bishop, but instead played `Qb3` exploiting the weakness of Black's `e6` and `f7` squares:

{{< figure src="/chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05_files/diag3FA6361ECBBCF26C.gif" title="Qb3" >}}

White's Bishop cannot be captured by Black. (See the annotations for details.) So I calmly developed with `Bg7`. Then Peter went totally wild with `h5`, which is not really sound, but is definitely *interesting*. Not only did he leave the Bishop unprotected, but he was sacrificing the `h` Pawn.

{{< figure src="/chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05_files/diag3FA636625EE9729E.gif" title="h5" >}}

I calmly took the Pawn. He followed up with the wild `Nh4` that continued to offer the Bishop as a sacrifice while attacking Black's `g6` Pawn:

{{< figure src="/chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05_files/diag3FA6366A23529BD6.gif" >}}

I did not take, but defended `g6` while also opening up a defense of the `e6` square. He then continued by sacrificing his Knight on `g6`.

{{< figure src="/chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05_files/diag3FA6368FCF1D708B.gif" title="Nxg6" >}}

This is not a true sacrifice, because he gets the Knight on `h5` in return. But the Bishop on `g5` is still being offered.

It turns out that this whole series of blows by White was unsound, and could have been refuted calmly by `Kf8`:

{{< figure src="/chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05_files/diag3FA636A01EC713E7.gif" title="Kf8 refutes attack" >}}

But I saw a related idea and did not play the correct refutation, so the game continued to be interesting rather than ending quickly. I played `d5`, which has a similar idea but has the drawback of allowing a good tactical save by White.

{{< figure src="/chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05_files/diag3FA63697F6F24239.gif" title="d5" >}}

White could have used a tactic to win the Pawn on `d5` while saving his Bishop from being trapped by attacking Black's Knight on `g6`. Oops! But neither Peter nor I saw this resource, and he did not play it.

{{< figure src="/chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05_files/diag3FA636D4EFF89295.gif" >}}

Instead, he played a completely unsound sacrifice `e4` that I could have punished by taking the Bishop on `g5`:

{{< figure src="/chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05_files/diag3FA636DCB461BBCD.gif" title="Black wins a piece for real" >}}

But in a collective hallucination, neither of us saw that the Bishop was in danger, because for so many moves up till `d5`, it was *not* in danger!

Instead, I opted to take the Pawn on `e4`.

### The middlegame

So White's opening attack finally came to an end, and we reached a middlegame in which Black has to get his King to safety but is one Pawn up. Objectively, the game is actually quite equal. I was happy to have reached this middlegame, after all the turmoil, not having seen the big refutations earlier.

After some natural moves, after which both sides were castled Queen side, I expected some kind of struggle on the King side in which White had pressure against Black's `h6` Pawn and possibly could regain it at some point.

{{< figure src="/chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05_files/diag3FA6371A10D3B49F.gif" title="Both castled" >}}

Instead, Peter *blundered* with another sacrifice, or *so I thought*. It turns out from extensive computer analysis that the sacrifice was actually *sound* and should have led to an equal position through some extremely fascinating play. Let me explain.

Peter played `Nxe4`, with the idea of regaining the piece after `Qf7`:

{{< figure src="/chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05_files/diag3FA6372171D13561.gif" title="Nxe4 sacrifice" >}}

{{< figure src="/chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05_files/diag3FA6372A607D57FB.gif" title="Qf7" >}}

It turns out that White does *not* regain the piece, after Black defends (as I did) with `Qd6`:

{{< figure src="/chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05_files/diag3FA637315E0F3046.gif" >}}

It turns out that White has a miraculously deep move `Ra5` that equalizes through threats on Black's King!! But neither of us saw this.

{{< figure src="/chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05_files/diag3FA6373985E401F4.gif" title="Ra5" >}}

Instead, Peter blundered straight into having his Queen trapped:

{{< figure src="/chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05_files/diag3FA6378607BCA4C0.gif" title="Queen trapped" >}}

The game was effectively over at this point.

### The endgame

However, Peter kept playing, and we ended up going into an endgame that was clearly lost for him (being a piece down):

{{< figure src="/chess/jansen-chen-2013-02-05_files/diag3FA6379E1BCF7153.gif" title="Lost endgame for White" >}}

The rest of the game is only worth looking at for its efficient technique.

Peter finally resigned after losing more and more material:

## Lessons learned from my game

- Don't take for granted that your opponent will play in exactly the same style you've seen for years.
- I don't think I have ever *in my entire life* played a game in which I have been offered so many sacrifices. It is important to keep one's cool and try to figure out the truth of each one.
- A sacrifice could be *sound*, yet not work because it is not followed up properly.
- A sacrifice could be *unsound*, yet work because the defender fails to respond correctly.
- It takes careful calculation to determine which sacrifices are sound and which are unsound, and we humans do not always see the full truth, but *computers* do.

## What next?

For round 5 next week, I have White against fellow Expert Richard Edahl. He is doing pretty well in the tournament, considering that, as he mentioned when he entered the tournament, he has not played in a single chess tournament in [*over twenty years*](http://main.uschess.org/msa/MbrDtlTnmtHst.php?10333784)! So I expect an interesting fight. I have no idea how idea how he plays, so this will be new and exciting.

## Conclusion

I give credit to Peter for completely surprising me by attacking and sacrificing aggressively for a win, totally contrary to how I've usually seen him play. The result was a fascinating game.
