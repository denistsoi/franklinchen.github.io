Those of you who follow my blog know that I have been conflicted about voting, but go and do it anyway, *most of the time*, e.g., [in November 2011 for the municipal election](/blog/2011/11/08/i-dont-know-if-i-should-vote-but-i-did/) and [in November 2012 for the general election](/blog/2012/11/06/i-decided-to-resign-myself-to-continue-voting/), when I felt there were some politicians very important to *vote against*.

## Apathy or ignorance?

In April 2012's general primary, however, I was sufficiently apathetic that I didn't bother voting, although Abby did. For that election, it seemed to me that the winners were all going to be obvious no matter what I did, and there were no close races where I really cared about who won. I feel that in the absence of an informed opinion, the only rational and moral thing to do is to stay out. It is *unfashionable* in our society to admit ["I don't know"](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/29/the-power-of-i-dont-know/), but if I truly don't know, then I see no point in participating.

[Primary elections](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election) are particularly problematic for me, because I simply oppose the concept and also resent being forced to register for one of the two major American political parties.

## May 2013 municipal primary: choosing mayor!

But this year's Democratic primary is *critical*, because it will basically determine who becomes the next [mayor of Pittsburgh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_mayoral_election,_2013), given that a Democrat will win in the general election in November. And since [Luke Ravenstahl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Ravenstahl) decided to step down, there is a possibility of *real change*.

So I was pretty excited to vote today to make a difference (I hope). This will be the first time I have voted for a [mayoral candidate in a primary](http://triblive.com/politics/politicalheadlines/4052165-74/percent-mayor-turnout) in my 15 years as a Pittsburgh resident. For once there may be a crack in the rusty Democratic political machine here?

[Voter turnout today has been crazy low](http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/local/neighborhoods-city/polls-open-for-primary-election-688496/). There was no line whatsoever when I went to vote or when Abby went. I've never participated in an election, I think, with such low turnout.

*Maybe this low turnout will end up being a good thing*. If people choose not to vote because they don't have informed opinions, then it means that I and the surprisingly large number of people I know who also voted for the same guy I did will *win*! (That said, it's sad if [only 2 percent of us decide the mayor](http://www.pittsburghmagazine.com/Best-of-the-Burgh-Blogs/Pitt-Girl/June-2013/Why-You-Must-Vote-in-Pittsburghs-Mayoral-Election/).)

## Media coverage

I avoided *most* media coverage of the election (hard to avoid everything completely, admittedly) until I had already voted. (Yes, that includes ignoring the basically meaningless "endorsements" of the [Post-Gazette](http://www.post-gazette.com/) and [Tribune-Review](http://triblive.com/).

Then I enjoyed reading [this little look at what's been going on with the mayoral race](http://www.pghcitypaper.com/Blogh/archives/2013/05/21/election-day-thoughts). And tomorrow I am back to ignoring the news.

Also, I had to recycle probably 30 or so paper flyers during election season. What a waste. And summarily delete dozens of robocalls on the answering machine. Note to everyone who sent me junk or left junk messages on my answering machine: *I did not read a single thing you sent, or listen to a single word you spoke; your junk only made me angry and at least partly less likely to vote for you, if I caught your name and remembered it*. **Pathetic.** I realize this crap works on some people, but I'm afraid it doesn't work on me: I'm not going to believe that your opponent eats children for breakfast, no matter what large fonts you use.

## Conclusion

In a moment of relief from apathy and cynicism about politics, I eagerly voted today. I hope I'll get to see whether I was justified.
