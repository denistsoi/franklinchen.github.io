Last week, I wrote on [The Chess Improver](http://chessimprover.com/) about [my third round game in the current Pittsburgh Chess Club Tuesday night tournament, in which I had a won game but did not win](/blog/2013/09/26/the-chess-improver-the-psychology-of-not-winning-the-won-game/).

This week, I wrote about my fourth round game, in which I did even worse, hence my new post: [The psychology of losing a drawn game](http://chessimprover.com/the-psychology-of-losing-a-drawn-game/).
