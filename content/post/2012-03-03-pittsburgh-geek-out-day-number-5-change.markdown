Today was the fifth session held of [Pittsburgh Geek Out Day](http://www.pghgeekoutday.com/). We met this time at Vivisimo. The topic was "change".

A summary of our topics is [here](http://www.pghgeekoutday.com/sessions/2012).

## Leaving early

I was said that I had to leave early at 11 AM, the first time that I've left a Pittsburgh Geek Out day event early; I had to attend an afternoon birthday party with Abby.

## (Update of 2014-01-16)

This is an unfinished post that is one of many in the past two years that lay unfinished because I had originally planned to write a very detailed report but never got around to it. I decided that I might as well release all these unfinished posts rather than leave them completely out of the record.
