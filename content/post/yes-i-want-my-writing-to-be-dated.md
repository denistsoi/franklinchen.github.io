title: "Yes, I want my writing to be dated!"
---

I just finished
[migrating both this blog and my programming blog from Octopress 2 to Hugo](http://conscientiousprogrammer.com/blog/2015/05/31/why-i-switched-from-octopress-2-to-hugo/). During
this process, I made sure to preserve my old URLs as well as Disqus,
because nothing is as distressing to me, as a reader, as moved or
broken links when I'm looking for old blog posts.

That said, there's always the possibility of changing the "real" URLs and
just using an alias with a URL redirect for the sake of old URL
schemes. One possibility was to remove dates from my URLs, e.g.,
change something like
`http://conscientiousprogrammer.com/blog/2015/05/31/why-i-switched-from-octopress-2-to-hugo/`
to
`http://conscientiousprogrammer.com/blog/why-i-switched-from-octopress-2-to-hugo/`. Matt
Gemmell, among many others, has argued for [permalinks that do not
include the clutter of embedded dates](http://mattgemmell.com/permalinks/).

However, I made the decision years ago, when I had the choice, to keep
the embedded dates, and I still stand by my decision today. Here's why.

<!--more-->

## Are embedded dates actually bad user-interface design?

I'm not sure long date-embedded permalinks are really so bad
visually:

- Nobody goes around having to manually type in these links anyway.
- I believe that in the long run, people actually do care about the
  date, and having it in the URL makes it that much easier to know the
  date.
- Redundancy can be a good thing, if it exposes useful information
  that in theory one could determine more indirectly.

## The bigger philosophical issues

However, the main reason I deliberately choose to expose the date of a
post is that I disagree with Matt Gemmell's statement that one should
prefer to boost one's article's "standing" by giving the impression
that one is making a "definitive goddamned opinion" on a topic, some
kind of timeless statement.

### Relevance?

I understand that there are people who would be swayed by this
psychological trick, and I totally confess that sometimes when I do a
Web search and up pops a link to a four-year-old post, I wonder
whether to read something else instead that might be more "relevant".

But as a reader who seeks genuinely useful information, no matter how
recent or old, I overcome my initial twinge at encountering an "old"
article, and check it out for its own merits. And often, I find that
it is just fine. For example, there are some fantastic Haskell blogs
filled with information still useful today. For example:

- Any of Dan Piponi's articles are great, e.g., a random 2009 article
  on
  [monoids and their uses](http://blog.sigfpe.com/2009/01/haskell-monoids-and-their-uses.html),
  with an ungainly URL of
  `http://blog.sigfpe.com/2009/01/haskell-monoids-and-their-uses.html`.
- Any of Gabriel Gonzalez's articles are great, e.g., a 2012 article
  on
  [free monads](http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/06/you-could-have-invented-free-monads.html)
  with the URL
  `http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/06/you-could-have-invented-free-monads.html`.

Furthermore, the dating is actually useful because once you see
another article by the same author with a different date, you know
which one came first and can retrace the *history* of the author's
thinking just throw the URL. In fact, I track my own history through
the fact that on my file system, my posts are in alphabetical order
according to date.

### The reality and humanity of transience

Finally, the main fact I want to emphasize when I write is precisely
that I am not giving my definitive opinion about anything.

**I have no "forever" opinions about any topic!**

I change my mind as I continue to grow and learn, and I want my
writing to reflect that, and in a way such that a reader can easily
track what changed and when. I do not write to give an illusion that I
am writing eternal truths. I do not write in order to be an authority
on a topic, but to share a snapshot of what I understand at a
particular moment in my life. When I change my mind, I do often go
back and add a dated update section linking to a new article.

## Conclusion

I have retained dated permalinks for my migrated blogs, despite some
voices that argue otherwise, because of the extra information they
provide.

**Do you agree that dated permalinks are worth the ugliness or not? Is
  this your opinion as an author, a reader, a critic, or a search
  engine user?**
