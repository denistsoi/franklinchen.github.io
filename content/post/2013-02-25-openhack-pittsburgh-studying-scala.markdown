Last month was the very first meeting of [OpenHack Pittsburgh](/blog/2013/01/21/attending-the-first-openhack-pittsburgh-meeting/), so I eagerlly looked forward to attending [the second one](http://www.meetup.com/pittsburgh-ruby/events/100822012/), which was held at [The Beauty Shoppe](http://www.thebeautyshoppe.org/), a new coworking space in East Liberty.

The space was still under construction and so it was kind of surreal being in there with a half-finished bathroom, walls and rooms that were not completely done yet, missing light fixtures, etc. It was cool that we were allowed to use the space though.

## Ashamed of leaving early

Unfortunately, there was something of a schedule conflict, because I was also looking forward to attending, in the same evening, another edition of the French and blues music jam I've been participating in. I ended up decided to attend OpenHack Pittsburgh for a while before leaving early and going to the music jam. [I did make it to the music jam](/blog/2013/02/25/stepping-it-up-at-the-french-and-blues-jam/), but in retrospect, I should have simply chosen not to attend OpenHack Pittsburgh at all.

I felt bad about leaving early, when everyone was so excited about the projects they were working on for the evening. There was even a [3d printer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing) in action!

Because I knew I was leaving early, I spent the time there just continuing to learn more Scala on my own.

I felt it was impolite for me to attend an event when I knew I had to leave early. I will remember this in the future.

## Conclusion

[Fear of missing out](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out) is insidious. It is better to be fully present and engaged in *fewer* activities rather than try to do too much. I felt deeply ashamed of leaving early, and vowed that if I attend OpenHack Pittsburgh meetings in the future, I will never leave early again. Something like this should be all or none.
