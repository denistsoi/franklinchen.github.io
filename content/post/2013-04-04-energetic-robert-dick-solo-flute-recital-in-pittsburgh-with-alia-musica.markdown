I attended [Robert Dick](http://www.robertdick.net/)'s [solo flute recital](http://www.facebook.com/events/135297873312141/) in Pittsburgh with [Alia Musica](http://www.alia-musica.org/).

It was a real treat. A real master of the flute.

Here he was during a sound check:

## (Update of 2014-01-16)

This is an unfinished post that is one of many in the past two years that lay unfinished because I had originally planned to write a very detailed report but never got around to it. I decided that I might as well release all these unfinished posts rather than leave them completely out of the record.
