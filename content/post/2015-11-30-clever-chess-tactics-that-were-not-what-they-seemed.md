title: "Clever chess tactics that were not what they seemed"
---
In round 3 of the current 6-round Pittsburgh Chess Club Tuesday night
tournament, I played a very tense game that led to an unusual position
with beautiful tactical possibilities. My opponent, Melih, is a strong
player who is a winner of the 2015 Pittsburgh Chess Club Championship earlier
this year, and had won the last two tournament games we have played,
so I came into this game anxious and also thirsty for revenge.

The game proved to be very challenging for both of us. I achieved a
better position out of the opening as Black but was too cautious to
press more aggressively. After more than 3 hours (!) of play, we ended
up in a simplified late middlegame in which I had only a small but
clear advantage. We were both clearly physically and mentally
exhausted, and starting to run out of time (these tournament games
have a time control of 2 hours per person with a 5-second delay per
move). It was up to me to try to find a way to win by inducing errors
in his play.

## Get ready to be quizzed!

What ended up happening was in retrospect both remarkable and
comic. To maximize your entertainment as well as challenge your
tactical skills, I recommend pausing at each diagrammed position below
in order to ask yourself what move you would play, and why, before
gradually uncovering the whole story.

Note: an interactive chess board with all variations is provided at
the end of this article.

## First, assess a quiet-looking starting position

For context, here is the position after 21 moves, after Black played
21...Qc6.

{{< figure src="/chess/ozbek-chen-2015-11-17/22w.png" title="21...Qc6; White to move" >}}

### Questions

- What opening do you think this middlegame came from?
- Who stands better and why?
- What is White's best plan, and what is Black's best plan?

### Answers

Congratulations if you guessed this was a
  [French Defense, Advance Variation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Defence#Advance_Variation:_3.e5),
  gone totally wrong for White!

Black stands better and has a simple plan:

- attack White's backward Pawn on c3 on the half-open file, and
  perhaps also the e5 Pawn as well; and the a2 Pawn and b4 Pawn are
  also potential targets
- use the half-open c-file for the Rooks, and the dark-squared Bishop
  against White's Pawns, and get the Queen involved as well
- using these attacks, overload White's defenses somehow in order to
  win at least one of those Pawns to enter a probably winning endgame

White's only possible counter-plan:

- defend the weak Queen side Pawns
- maybe plant the Knight on a good outpost such as d4
- defend the Pawn on e5 with maybe an f4 advance, and hope to attack
  Black's King side with perhaps an f5 break

## Progress after seven moves?

Black has just played 28...Rc4.

{{< figure src="/chess/ozbek-chen-2015-11-17/29w.png" title="28...Rc4; White to move" >}}

### Questions

- Who has made more progress in the last seven moves: White or Black?
- What is the nature of the progress made?

### Answers

White has played to wait to see what Black is up to; meanwhile, Black
has made some progress on the Queen side by:

- doubling Rooks on the half-open c-file
- using the Queen to bear down on White's a-Pawn, which White has
  (mistakenly) advanced to a3.

## White played a surprising move

White has just played 29 Rac2.

{{< figure src="/chess/ozbek-chen-2015-11-17/29b.png" title="29 Rac2; Black to move" >}}

### Questions

On the 29th move, White moved the Rook from a2 to c2, leaving the
defense of the a3 Pawn.

- What is the meaning of this strange move?!
- Can Black just take the Pawn with the Queen?

### Answers

You may be thinking "White is provocatively setting a trap for Black
to fall into". You get credit if you can see the trap.

## Black fell into a trap?

I played 29...Qxa3.

{{< figure src="/chess/ozbek-chen-2015-11-17/30w.png" title="29...Qxa3; White to move" >}}

But wait, I took the Pawn! Did I fall into a trap?

### Questions

- What is the trap you saw earlier, if you saw it?
- Is it really a trap?

## White closed the trap?

White has played 30 Ra2.

{{< figure src="/chess/ozbek-chen-2015-11-17/30b.png" title="30 Ra2; Black to move" >}}

### Answers

So the Rook moved back to a2, apparently trapping Black's Queen. But
again, was it really a trap?

## Black refuted the trap?

Black played 30...Rxd4.

{{< figure src="/chess/ozbek-chen-2015-11-17/31w.png" title="30...Rxd4; White to move" >}}

You get credit if you saw this move taking White's Knight on d4, and
saw that White's Queen is overloaded such that retaking the Rook in
either one of two ways leads to losing back the Rook on c1 and
therefore losing a piece overall and the game.

I was very proud of seeing this tactic. (If you saw a different move
for Black, we'll discuss that further down below.)

## White refuted the refutation?

White played 31 Qc2.

{{< figure src="/chess/ozbek-chen-2015-11-17/31b.png" title="31 Qc2; Black to move" >}}

When Melih moved his Queen to c2, I was in shock and disgust at
myself: in my fatigue near the end of this game, and overexcitement at
believing I had "refuted" a "trap", I had completely failed to take
into account that White was not actually required to take my Rook on d4!

Amusingly, it turns out that Melih, after playing 29 Rac2 setting the
"trap", saw to his horror the resource 30...Rxd4, and thought he was
lost, but then saw 31 Qc2. So neither of us had originally seen this
saving resource for White.

### Questions

- Is Black's Queen trapped for real now?
- What should Black do? Is Black lost? Or is Black still winning? Or
  should Black start looking for a draw?

## Black panicked, trying to draw

Yes, Black's Queen is trapped for real. You get credit if you saw
that Black's flashy 30...Rxd4 had this flaw.

The only question for me was how best to give up my Queen.

I chose poorly. In a daze, I could not think straight. I chose to give
back a Rook with 31...Qxc3, in order to force a trade Queens on c3 and
go into an endgame an exchange down for two Pawns, and hope for a draw.

{{< figure src="/chess/ozbek-chen-2015-11-17/36w.png" title="31...Qxc3; White to move" >}}

I was correct that the resulting position was objectively equal and
drawable, but in a time scramble, it's obviously easier to play White,
and for the rest of the game, both sides made major errors (with White
botching up winning positions and Black botching up drawn positions)
until a simplified position was reached (Rook and two Pawns for each
side) with only seconds left on the clock, and a draw agreed. I
consider myself lucky to have drawn. The final position was:

{{< figure src="/chess/ozbek-chen-2015-11-17/draw.png" title="Agreed drawn" >}}


## But Black could have played to win

You get credit if you chose instead to sacrifice the Queen with
31...Qxc1+ to get the Rook and Bishop and Pawns against White's Queen,
with advantage and a good chance of winning. After 32 Qxc1 Bxb4, Black
is about to win White's c3 Pawn:

{{< figure src="/chess/ozbek-chen-2015-11-17/33rooksw.png" title="32...Bxb4; White to move" >}}

In fact, if you saw all this when thinking about whether to take the
Pawn on a3 in the first place, then you get bonus points for seeing a
way to an advantage through the sequence of tactical blows. Neither
Melih nor I saw any of this up front, unfortunately.

I chickened out and did not take this continuation because after being
shocked that my Queen was disappearing, I experienced a visceral fear
that I needed to bring down White's Queen also, else it with White's
Rook might be dangerous to my King.

It turns out that my fear was objectively unwarranted, as Black's
defenses are sufficient because of the power of the dark-squared
Bishop to hit White's e5 Pawn and even the f2 Pawn, but I was not
thinking straight any more as time was running out for the four-hour
game and it was already around 11 PM at night on a weekday.

### One possible position

Here is a position that might have arisen if I had gone into this
variation:

{{< figure src="/chess/ozbek-chen-2015-11-17/35rooksw.png" title="White to move" >}}

The thing is, even though the computer says Black has an advantage, it
could be scary playing against White's Queen.

### Another possible position

But analysis also shows that White has to be very careful. For
example, if White is greedy and wastes time taking Black's a7 Pawn
above, Black quickly gets a winning attack:

{{< figure src="/chess/ozbek-chen-2015-11-17/37rooksw.png" title="White to move" >}}

In time pressure, anything can happen, and I think it would have been
very likely that White would have grabbed the a7 Pawn, after which
Black's position play itself.

## Finally: Black's real refutation!

I said you get extra credit for seeing everything to the point of
sacrificing Black's Queen for an advantage. But you only get full
credit if you saw the real refutation of White's "trap" earlier in the
game! I kicked myself for not having seen it.

### Questions

- Was there a point at which Black could have deviated and won the
game outright?
- Hint: which of Black's pieces have we not focused on in the
  variations covered so far?

### Answers

Black could, after White "trapped" the Queen with 30 Ra2, used a
different and better deflection of White's overloaded Queen than
30...Rxd4, which was OK but not best.

We haven't looked at Black's Bishop enough. I only saw this upon
recovering from the draw and analyzing the game later at home: the
winning shot is 30...Bg5!

{{< figure src="/chess/ozbek-chen-2015-11-17/31varw.png" title="White to move" >}}

If White blocks the threat to the Queen with 31 f4,
then Black just lops off the Pawn with 31...Bxf4 and now:

- if White takes the Bishop or otherwise moves the Queen, Black will
win either the Rook on a2 or the Rook on c1
- if White takes Black's Queen, then Black takes White's Queen on d2
  with tempo and will eventually win all three of White's weak
  Pawns on dark squares (c3 followed by e5 and b4)

Either way, the endgame is an easy win for Black.

Neither Melih nor I saw this winning resource for Black during the
game. We just weren't looking at that quiet Bishop because it hadn't
participated in anything up till that point.

## Conclusion

Chess never ceases to surprise me. Tactical possibilities are
everywhere, and in this game, both Melih and I missed various
possible continuations, playing moves thinking we knew what had to
follow. I hope you enjoyed this story of missed opportunities and
incomplete calculations.

My thanks to Melih for a challenging and fascinating game, and sharing
his thoughts with me afterwards.
