I'm not sure what to do with my old Apple Macintosh [PowerBook 145B](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBook_140#PowerBook_145B) laptop. It still boots, but is obviously not of much use to me any more.

Here it is booting [System 7](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_7):

The machine had crashed years ago before I booted it:

Finally, boot is complete:

Some personal history and observations:

<!--more-->

This PowerBook 145B was the second laptop I owned; the first was a [PowerBook Duo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBook_Duo) that I bought used, found problematic, and sold. I also bought the 145B used. I didn't splurge and buy a new Mac till the [Power Macintosh 6100](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_6100) in 1995.

With only 2 MB (that's no typo; these days computers come with *one thousand times* as much RAM, more like 2 GB typically), it was necessary to monitor memory usage and quit unused applications. It was a mistake upgrading to System 7.5 on this machine, I have to admit. And with a 40 MB hard drive, I was always having to put stuff onto floppies. I bought software like RAM Doubler and Disk Doubler and Speed Doubler, but they were obviously not a panacea.

Still, I got stuff done with this laptop.

Eventually, the battery refused to hold any more real charge, and since the adapter connection got flaky, that is why the last time I used the laptop, it suddenly just lost power and shut down uncleanly.

I already threw away all my floppies years ago, and there is no network card for the laptop, so it really is useless now. I have a cute ADB-based 28.8k modem that I used with the laptop for many years. I even browsed the Web, having [Mosaic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_%28web_browser%29) installed, although I preferred using [MacWeb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacWeb).

I haven't seriously used this laptop since 1998, when I was still taking it with me on travel.

## Conclusion

My PowerBook 145B is such a museum piece now. What should I do with it? Wipe the hard drive and donate it somewhere, or keep around myself to amuse the millennial generation who are now babies playing with iPads?
