Jennifer Conner, second flute with Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, presented a lecture and master class entitled "Becoming a Great Ensemble Player and a Valued Colleague in an Orchestra" at CMU.

This was the second master class I've attended in my life (the first one being at the [Mideast early music workshop last summer](/blog/2012/07/21/mideast-early-music-workshop-a-life-changing-experience/)).

I took a lot of notes while observing and reflecting on what she said and demonstrated and what the music students did. It was a very educational experience for me.

## (Update of 2014-01-16)

This is an unfinished post that is one of many in the past two years that lay unfinished because I had originally planned to write a very detailed report but never got around to it. I decided that I might as well release all these unfinished posts rather than leave them completely out of the record.
