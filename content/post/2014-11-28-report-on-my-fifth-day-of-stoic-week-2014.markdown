I had some setbacks today, the fifth day of Stoic Week, but dealt with them.

## A coconut oil accident yesterday at Thanksgiving party

By the time we left [yesterday's Thanksgiving party](/blog/2014/11/27/report-on-my-fourth-day-of-stoic-week-2014/) in the evening, I wasn't feeling so well. I had blamed eating that one cookie and also drinking a bit of spicy warm cider, but as unpleasant symptoms developed (you don't need to know the details), I immediately knew what must have happened.

A bit of history, years ago I experimented with [using coconut oil](/blog/2012/01/26/improving-my-breakfast-and-other-meals/) but found that I could tolerate only a little bit, and in fact quickly decided to just not use it any more in cooking, after some incidents in which I experienced very unpleasant symptoms after a meal and found out that Abby had used a good amount of coconut oil in cooking. We had her limit the use of coconut oil in cooking anything I was to eat.

So it had been quite some time since I experienced those symptoms, but unfortunately, I suffered for over twelve hours with poor sleep overnight, and can only conclude that a large mount of coconut oil was used in Thanksgiving dinner!

## My system temporarily wrecked, illustrating today's theme

So I not only woke up late in the morning today, but was also still suffering physically, was hungry nonetheless, and grouchy. Normally I try to start my day with meditation, but I just wanted to eat breakfast. Abby had gotten up hours before me and was annoyed I had gotten up late, and snapped at me while I was bleary-eyed and trying to start eating breakfast. I snapped back, and she got very upset and disappeared.

While eating, I recognized that I had gone totally non-Stoic, and so after I finished eating and reading today's theme on "action and the reserve clause", I immediately went to meditate for ten minutes before talking with her again, in a much calmer mood, explaining what had been happening.

I went back to napping, and then before lunch time, after my final visit to the toilet, I finally felt like my coconut oil disaster was truly over and I could start my day.

I felt I had "failed" in that, contrary to Stoic teaching, I had let my physical distress take over my mind and everything I was doing. I could have dealt better with my situation, acting the best I could despite my circumstance rather than giving into my foul mood.

The "reserve clause" in Stoicism refers to how we *act* even though we may not like what has happened or what might happen. I did not start the morning with this attitude.

## Exercise

Abby and I eventually made up, but it really bothered me that I had started off the day so badly. I was also feeling like my muscles were trashed from yesterday's workout (and party play with the two sisters). Later in the afternoon, we went for a hike in Frick Park and both felt better. I considered that my "exercise" for the day, a lower-intensity day.

## Conclusion

I had a setback in my practice of Stoicism but recovered, with even more appreciation for daily reading and study to get back on track.

**How do you deal with setbacks? Do you have a system, a philosophical principle, to keep you on track?**
