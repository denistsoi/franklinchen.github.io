A year ago, I got my first smartphone, a [Samsung Galaxy SII through T-Mobile](/blog/2012/03/22/paradox-i-will-observe-the-national-day-of-unplugging-but-just-bought-my-first-smartphone-this-week/).

At some point I upgraded it to [Ice Cream Sandwich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_version_history). Unfortunately, that introduced a *terrible* limitation for my phone: I found that I could not disable the shutter-clicking sound effect when capturing video!! I looked online and found that it was not possible without rooting. This made me truly angry because it meant that my phone was *unusable* for capturing video. Friends told me I should [root](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_rooting) the phone already, rather than submit to Samsung's draconian disabling of the preference to turn off the shutter sound.

Jelly Bean just finally arrived for my phone. I installed it, and the problem went away. Whew.
