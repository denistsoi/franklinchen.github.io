Yesterday, I had a brutal drive of almost fifty minutes after work to attend a [Pittsburgh JavaScript Developers](http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-JavaScript-Developers/) meeting about [AMD and CommonJS modules](http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-JavaScript-Developers/events/34568402/), where [Brian Cavalier](http://briancavalier.com/) gave a nice [presentation](http://briancavalier.com/presentations/pgh-js-amd-10-2011/) on module systems for JavaScript and comparing their strengths and weaknesses.

I survived the drive the same way I survived it [last week](/blog/2011/09/27/when-jquery-attacks/), which was actually not as bad as yesterday's was!

What I can't stand about driving for half an hour or an hour, regardless of traffic situations, is being physically immobilized and mentally trapped. I have a backup plan in case I have to do such driving. I always have in my car's CD player a CD of "Voice Lessons To Go" by [Ariella Vaccarino](http://voicelessonstogo.com/).

So not only do I avoid wasting time and stay mentally alert and active, but it is also pretty physically intense, with all the breathing. I got a pretty good singing workout yesterday. Ariella's guidance on the CD is very clear and friendly. I love it! I'm thinking of getting more volumes of this series.
