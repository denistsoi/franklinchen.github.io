One thing Abby and I wanted to do before we left Washington DC was to visit the [House of Musical Traditions](http://www.hmtrad.com/) in Takoma Park, MD. We wanted to check out all their musical instruments. Abby wanted to look at their mandolin section, while I wanted to look at Irish flutes. I've been kind of thinking about getting an Irish flute since February when [seeing again Gregory play his Irish flute at French dancing](/blog/2012/02/20/enjoying-more-french-dancing-in-pittsburgh/).

We weren't planning to buy anything, but we had fun looking at a large variety of musical instruments, from mandolins and ukuleles to bongo drums and jaw harps.

## Irish flutes

At the store, I looked at the [Tony Dixon plastic flutes](http://www.hmtrad.com/catalog/winds/dixon.html) that I'd read about before the trip to DC. Unfortunately, as I suspected, they were rather large for my hands. Also, the plastic flutes did not produce a very attractive sound.

## Casey Burns Folk Flute

I left the store knowing I would have to do more research on affordable keyless Irish flutes that might both fit in my hands and produce a decent sound. After doing some research online, I concluded that no plastic Irish flute was really going to be what I wanted. But there were rave reviews of the [Casey Burns Folk Flute](http://www.caseyburnsflutes.com/ff.php) as a starter Irish flute, because of its quality and its unbeatable price.

Furthermore, I noticed that there was option to order a special [ergonomic version for small hands](http://www.caseyburnsflutes.com/ergo.php), which is precisely what I seem to need, given my [very real need for well-fitting instruments](/blog/2012/05/18/got-my-new-and-more-ergonomic-flute/).

After we return to Pittsburgh, Abby and I will discuss whether my music goals and plans justify buying yet another musical instrument.

## Conclusion

I would like to thank the people at the House of Musical Traditions for letting us look at their large collection of musical instruments and try some out. Meanwhile, I have learned that if I do get an Irish flute, I should start out with the nice wooden Casey Burns Folk Flute.
