I have finally submitted an order for the [Casey Burns Small-Handed Folk Flute](http://www.caseyburnsflutes.com/ff.php), after having sat on the decision for two weeks and discussing it with Abby.

## Rationale

Basically, I am committed in the long run to exploring Irish music seriously, so this is not just a whimsical purchase. Also, I can obviously use this flute to play other traditional, non-Irish music as well.

I ordered this flute along with [Grey Larsen's highly acclaimed book, "The Essential Guide to Irish Flute and Tin Whistle"](http://www.caseyburnsflutes.com/grey_book.php), a book that I expect to serve as a comprehensive tutorial and reference for years' worth of study!
