[Last year I wrote about experimenting with winter running in Vibram FiveFingers shoes](/blog/2012/01/02/new-experiment-for-a-new-year-winter-running-in-vibram-fivefingers-shoes/). The experiment basically failed, once it got too cold or snowy/icy.

This year, because it has been "warm" (for example, today it was 37 degrees F), the story has been different. I have been able sometimes to run outside on the roads in my Vibram FiveFingers Bikila LS shoes, and without socks, even.

Here are the conditions under which I am able to do this:

- temperature above freezing
- no ice
- no puddles of melted or melting water
- running on roads or sidewalks

One drawback is that even when the trails of Frick Park are runnable (with a bit of residual snow and ice), wearing FiveFingers out there is not advisable. [I wear standard mono-toed shoes when trail running now](/blog/2012/12/31/why-i-went-frick-park-trail-running-in-snowfall-for-the-first-time-in-a-decade/) if I do it at all.

As long as there are no cold water or ice danger issues, I will experiment with continuing to run in FiveFingers shoes, adding Injinji socks when it gets colder.
