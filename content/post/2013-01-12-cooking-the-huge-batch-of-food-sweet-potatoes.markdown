It's Saturday, so I did a huge batch of cooking.

There were a lot of sweet potatoes that needed to be used. I sauteed some of them and roasted the others. Same with the assorted peppers. The butternut squash I kept simple, just slicing in half, putting them face down in a pan with some water, and baking.

Sweet potatoes in progress already in skillet:

Preparing onions (and garlic to be added later):

A separate batch of sweet potatoes, in the oven:

Sweet potatoes and peppers cut into "fries" from the oven, a favorite of mine:

Butternut squash from the oven, to be scooped out and seasoned:
