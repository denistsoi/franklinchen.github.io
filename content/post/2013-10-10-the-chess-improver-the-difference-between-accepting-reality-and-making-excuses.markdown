Last week, I wrote on [The Chess Improver](http://chessimprover.com/) about [my fourth round game in the current Pittsburgh Chess Club Tuesday night tournament, in which I lost a game that should have been drawn](/blog/2013/10/03/the-chess-improver-the-psychology-of-losing-a-drawn-game/).

This week, I wrote about my fifth round game, in which I won, but played poorly at a critical point: [The difference between accepting reality and making excuses](http://chessimprover.com/the-difference-between-accepting-reality-and-making-excuses/).
