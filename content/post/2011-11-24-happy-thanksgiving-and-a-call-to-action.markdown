Happy Thanksgiving, everyone! Please take time out to give thanks today, whether out loud or silently.

Yesterday I wrote about how [every day is Thanksgiving](/blog/2011/11/23/every-day-is-thanksgiving/). At the end of the post, I wondered about further improving my gratitude practice. I woke up today with a burning desire to take action. I'd like to know what you think of my specific ideas.

## Gratitude letters

I first heard about gratitude letters from the fantastic book ["The How of Happiness"](http://chass.ucr.edu/faculty_book/lyubomirsky/) by [Sonja Lyubomirsky](http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~sonja/index.html). The idea is to directly write a letter of gratitude to an individual.

I thought about this in the context of all the free and open source software I use regularly for work or for personal purposes. I was thinking that I should start taking the time to thank, one by one, each of the developers or teams of such software.

Also, I follow a lot of blogs. Many of them don't have many followers, so commenting more and offering gratitude would probably be very welcome.

## Gratitude-themed blog post

Perhaps I could reserve one day a week of my blog for the gratitude theme.

## Gratitude in every blog post

Or I could find a way to express gratitude in every blog post I write.

## Gratitude tweets

Maybe I could tweet gratitude more often. I don't want to annoy my Twitter followers with too much though. And I admit I don't like the length restriction. I guess I don't see as much value in tweeting gratitude as in writing even a decent one-paragraph email to someone.

## Integrate into Digital Sabbath

Recently I began to observe a little bit of a [Digital Sabbath](/blog/2011/11/12/starting-a-mini-digital-sabbath/) on which I do not write a blog post. Maybe I could reserve the day after the Digital Sabbath for a gratitude-oriented post?

## Other ideas

Lyubomirsky has other ideas, some of which are in [this interview](http://blog.beliefnet.com/beyondblue/2010/05/5-ways-to-practice-gratitude-a.html).

## Your ideas

What ideas do you have about how to integrate more gratitude into your life, starting this Thanksgiving? Or ideas you have about how *I* should integrate more gratitude into my life, into my blog?

## Postscript

I will be observing an extended Digital Sabbath till the end of the weekend. There will be a lot of turkey, and a lot of friends and family to see again.
