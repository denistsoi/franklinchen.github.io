Tonight at PittJUG, Chris Umbel gave a version of the talk he did for the Pittsburgh Ruby group a couple of months ago. You can read my report on that [here](/blog/2011/10/06/pittsburgh-ruby-building-a-compiler-in-jruby/).

You might wonder why I attended the PittJUG meeting then, if I already heard the talk. The fact is, I've learned that the most value I get from attending these user group meetings is not so much the presentations (although I get considerable value, actually, from learning about good or not so good presentation techniques), but just hanging out to chat before and after a presentation, whether about the topic of the presentation or not.

## Presentation materials

Greg has uploaded Chris's slides as well as a video of the PittJUG talk:
