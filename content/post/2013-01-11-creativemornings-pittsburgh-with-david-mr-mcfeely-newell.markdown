Abby and I attended [another CreativeMornings/Pittsburgh lecture](http://creativemornings.com/talks/david-newell/1); our first was [last month's premiere](/blog/2012/12/14/creativemornings-pittsburgh-the-first-session-nina-barbuto/).

This one featured [David Newell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Newell), who played Mr. McFeely on ["Mister Rogers' Neighborhood"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mister_Rogers%27_Neighborhood). I watched that show as a toddler in the 1970s. I don't actually remember that much from it, because I was so young and my English was quite poor, but I still do remember how soothing Fred Rogers was on the show, singing and moving very deliberately. I believe the show was a positive part of my life.

The main lesson David Newell shared was that *attitudes are taught*. He emphasized that there was naysaying about the TV show early on, but once it was created, eventually the public caught on.

You can watch his talk here:
