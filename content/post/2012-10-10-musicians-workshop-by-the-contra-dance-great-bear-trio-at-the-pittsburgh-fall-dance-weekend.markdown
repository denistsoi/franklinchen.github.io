I was invited by Donna to attend a musicians' workshop being held as part of the[Pittsburgh contra fall dance weekend](http://pittsburghcontra.org/fdw/fdw-2012-schedule/). Members of the [Great Bear Trio](http://www.greatbeartrio.com/Great_Bear_Trio/Home.html) discussed their perspective on the interplay between music and dance.

It was a great opportunity to hear some frank and useful advice about how to work with dancers as musicians in order to collaborate to create great experiences for both, given that often there are differences in expectations.

## (Update of 2014-01-16)

This is an unfinished post that is one of many in the past two years that lay unfinished because I had originally planned to write a very detailed report but never got around to it. I decided that I might as well release all these unfinished posts rather than leave them completely out of the record.
