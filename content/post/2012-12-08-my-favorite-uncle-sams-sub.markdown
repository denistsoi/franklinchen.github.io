Last Sunday, after a long first rehearsal for the [Holiday Ball Orchestra](/blog/2012/11/24/preparing-to-play-irish-flute-in-the-holiday-ball/), I was starving, and since Abby was off in Weirton performing in a [Pittsburgh Mandolin Orchestra](http://www.pittsburghmandolinsociety.org/), I decided to indulge in a dinner alone at the local [Uncle Sam's Subs](http://www.unclesamssubs.com/) in Squirrel Hill.

I've been eating at Uncle Sam's Subs periodically since moving to Pittsburgh 15 years ago. I've tried all the options (I ate out a lot more during my early grad school days in Pittsburgh), including, during my vegetarian phase, the really tasty Mediterranean, Vegetarian Combo, Roma Vegetable, Vegetable Florentine, and Grilled Portabella subs (see the [menu](http://www.unclesamssubs.com/menu)).

Nowadays I indulge in an Uncle Sam's sub only maybe two or three times a year, as a ["cheat" meal](/blog/2012/06/16/the-joy-of-eating-ice-cream-for-breakfast/) when I'm feeling the big craving for one.

I *always* eat in, because they give you a whole bunch of fries for free when you eat in rather than take out. For me, it's all about the fries!

I've settled on the Uncle Sam's Special Steak as my usual selection these days, because it strikes a good balance of cheese steak, mushrooms, peppers, and cheese.

I ate the whole thing! It took me some time:

I was very satisfied afterwards.

## Conclusion

I totally recommend Uncle Sam's Subs if you're very hungry and need to refuel. Whether you're an omnivore or a vegetarian, check it out! Eat in for the fries. And make sure to get your metabolism up by exercising or something beforehand, because else you'll get carb coma.
