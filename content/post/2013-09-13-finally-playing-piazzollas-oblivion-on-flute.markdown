Almost a year ago, I almost played Piazzolla's tango "Oblivion" on flute with piano accompaniment by Henry [at a party](/blog/2012/12/02/oblivion-obsession-time-to-start-playing-melodica/) but I ended up playing melodica instead of flute.

Having the opportunity to play with Henry again, this time I played it on flute, finally! I had found an oboe and piano arrangement which we used, sight reading it. I think the arranger filled in his own ornamentation into the melodic line. I only used that as a guide. Personally, when I play "Oblivion", I improvise my own embellishments on the spot, depending on my mood. I play it very freely: it cries out for self-expression.

## (Update of 2014-10-23) Some other performances of "Oblivion"

In my [blog post of 2012](/blog/2012/12/02/oblivion-obsession-time-to-start-playing-melodica/), I embedded a lot of my favorite performances I found on YouTube of "Oblivion". Here are some more.

### Flute/cello/piano trio (Mathilde Caldérini, Zoé Karlikow, Aurèle Marthan)

Very beautiful performance, great unity and balance and expression from all three musicians.

### 7 flute choir

An unusual 7-flute arrangement, with all parts played by the same person, Manja Thessin! A bonus is that the video is a beautiful demonstration of tango dancing by David and Kim Benitez of [Tango Movement](http://www.tangomovement.com/)

### J'oublie (voice), Elena-Lydia Stamellou

A lovely, pure voice with piano accompaniment.

### Piano, improvisational, Gila Goldstein

A gorgeous, floating performance, very free, with lovely touches in filling in inner voices and adding drama effectively through contrast, detail, and improvisation.

### Guitar duo, Katrin Klingeberg and Sebastián Montes

What a partnership! A passionate performance with contrasting moods, immense focus, really captures the spirit of the piece.

### Guitar solo, Ryuji Kunimatsu

Wow, one guy on guitar, all by himself, in his own arrangement, beautifully expressive.

### Melodica and piano, one musician simultaneously! Haim Shapira

A novelty item, definitely. There are compromises from trying to arrange to play both melodica and piano at the same time, but this is a fascinating free arrangement.

### Piano solo arrangement, Viktoriya Yermolyeva

A very passionate performance on piano by the arranger herself.

### Digital piano solo (Roland FP4),

Really quite good, based on Yermolyeva's arrangement.
