I went to a French potluck dance party at Lisa's. For the first time, I attended without Abby, because she was up at [SNPJ](http://www.snpjrec.com/) for an international folk dance camp; actually, we had a fairly low turnout (I counted fourteen people) because some others who would have come to the potluck are at the camp with her!

It's been months since I was involved with French dance or music, because I gave all that up temporarily in order to focus on [learning ukulele starting less than two months ago](/blog/2013/08/23/another-unexpected-life-change-one-month-of-learning-to-play-ukulele/).

The last French potluck dance party I attended was [almost four months ago](/blog/2013/05/25/learning-the-congo-de-captieux-traditional-french-dance/). I really love this informal 

## Potluck

I made a huge batch of vegetables for the potluck.

My simple recipe:

- three bunches of broccoli with florets and stems (sliced thinly)
- extra virgin olive oil
- [Trader Joe's South African smoke seasoning](http://www.traderjoes.com/fearless-flyer/article.asp?article_id=149)
- two tomatoes
- one onion
- one clove of garlic

## Dancing

Here's a photo of some dancing in action.

I did not actually do much dancing this evening at all, because of my slow recovery from a [really bad injury from a week ago](/blog/2013/09/06/was-it-worth-sprinting-to-a-terrible-fall-to-finish-25th-in-the-cmu-pretty-good-race-5k/). I only did one dance. My left arm, left hip, and right knee are in constant pain.

I did join John by playing flute along with him on button accordion. By the way, he's planning to order a new one with more rows and more keys to play in.

There were not enough women tonight for pairing up. It was joked that this is a "Pittsburgh problem", because usually when it comes to dancing, there are not enough men!

## Conclusion

Although I could not really dance tonight, I appreciated the opportunity to socialize and make music, and not feel so lonely at home alone while Abby was out of town!
