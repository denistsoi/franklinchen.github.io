While in Washington, D.C. with Abby to visit new nephew, I took time out to attend a meeting of the [Washington Recorder Society](http://metosrv2.umd.edu/~baer/WRS/). It's a much bigger group than the Pittsburgh Recorder Society! We broke up into many subgroups and I joined a couple of other people to play together. I enjoyed the hospitality and refreshments.
