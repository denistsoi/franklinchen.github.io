After finishing my road racing "season" for this year a while ago with the [Run Shadyside 5K](/blog/2011/10/01/run-shadyside-5k-outrunning-mickey-mouse-and-lending-a-trumpet/) that, frankly, left me quite exhausted, I returned to my true love, running easy in the trails of [Frick Park](http://www.pittsburghparks.org/frick), just minutes away from where I live.

On Monday, enjoying the strangely warm and dry weather, I did my usual five-mile route in the morning. The autumn leaves were not yet in full glorious color, but I took along my camera (for the first time ever on a run), to capture some of the experience.

I began by jogging slowly to the closest entrance of the park, the blue slide playground.

I ran past the playground and the meadow area to get to the Riverview Trail. I prefer getting off concrete and asphalt as quickly as possible when running!

I took Riverview Trail to where it meets with the Riverview Extension Trail that sharply goes downhill, but veered off to take the Lower Riverview Trail.

I like the Lower Riverview Trail because it is relatively more isolated here and is a long, winding trail with tree roots and shade that make the terrain feel more natural. This is where at other times of year I see deer crossing my path.

Finally, I reached the Falls Ravine Trail, which descends all the way to Fern Hollow. I enjoy this section of my route because I like to run downhill, and to the sounds of the stream that lies along the trail.

Reaching the bottom, at Fern Hollow, this is the point at which I use the water fountain (if it is turned on), and then (if I am doing my five mile run and not a longer one) reverse course to return home.

## Dogs

I always see a lot of dogs when in Frick Park. But this day, while running back uphill, I saw something I don't usually see: a guy with his dog high up climbing up well off trail!

Here's a video I took while running along one of my favorite windy sections of the Lower Riverview Trail (warning: very choppy footage).

Finally, on the way back to the blue slide playground entrance to the park, I saw my last set of dogs.

## Shoes

Off road, I always run in my [Vibram FiveFingers KSO Trek](http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/products/Five-Fingers-KSO-Trek-Mens.htm) shoes. I love these shoes. They are comfortable, breathe well, do not give me blisters, and protect my feet quite sufficiently against rocks.

These are my favorite [FiveFingers](http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/) shoes. The other two models I wear, the [Bikila LS](/blog/2011/09/25/blistered-but-blissful-in-the-burgh/) and the [KSO](/blog/2011/10/08/my-god-its-full-of-stairs-pittsburgh-step-trek-2011/), are less comfortable for me.

## Summary

I love trail running, I love Frick Park, and I feel blessed to live in Pittsburgh, and near such a park!
