So there's an [Oatmeal](http://theoatmeal.com/) comic that's been going around before today, [Columbus Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Day), about [Christopher Columbus and some guy I hadn't heard of before, Bartolomé de las Casas](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/columbus_day).

It's worth checking out, although be warned, it's a big rant. For "balance", here's a [rebuttal by someone unhappy with that Oatmeal rant](http://observationdeck.io9.com/seriously-screw-the-oatmeal-1443252499).

Meanwhile, people seem to still be debating the time-honored theory that [Columbus brought syphilis back to Europe](http://news.discovery.com/history/us-history/columbus-syphilis-010512.htm).

Also, there's discussion of how [Columbus caused inflation in Europe](http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2013/10/how-columbus-caused-inflation/).

Whatever else one can say, it cannot be denied that the arrival of Columbus to the "New World" in 1492 completely changed the course of world history, in a huge number of ways.

Oh, and what about Bartolomé? Read about him at the Oatmeal link and [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartolom%C3%A9_de_las_Casas). Another controversial historical figure, arguably more complex and interesting than [Columbus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus).
