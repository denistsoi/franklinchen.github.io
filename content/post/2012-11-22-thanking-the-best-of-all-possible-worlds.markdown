Today, on a sunny Thanksgiving, I surprised myself by spontaneously deciding to thank this world, and go as far as to call it [**the best of all possible worlds**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_of_all_possible_worlds). I'm still not entirely sure what I mean by that, but somehow, I "believe" it; more precisely, it's an *attitude* I now have that I have never really had in my life up till now. Even [a year ago](/blog/2011/11/23/every-day-is-thanksgiving/), I would have thought it silly to adopt such an attitude.

A friend of mine asked, "Dr. Pangloss?"

In other words, am I being a fool?

## Being Dr. Pangloss?

Dr. Pangloss is a fictional character from [Voltaire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaire)'s satirical novella ["Candide"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candide) that was required reading in high school French. I remember reading that novella in high school, of course: it was a *profound* influence on me at the time, instilling a certain cynicism in me that lasted years. Voltaire wrote this novella as a direct attempt to refute [Leibniz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz)'s philosophy of the ["best of all possible worlds"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_of_all_possible_worlds): Pangloss is a buffoonish character who spouts parodies of Leibniz's reasoning.

No question about it, Candide is a wickedly entertaining satire, and Voltaire is a towering figure from the French Enlightenment, one who exposed a lot of hypocrisy and was an advocate of many social reforms.

## Philosophy vs. attitude

However, I have over the years come to believe that the Enlightenment emphasis on Reason is not by itself the panacea to the mysteries and problems of life. In particular, I perceive that often, this emphasis leads to arrogance, anger, and selective blindness. There doesn't seem any logical *reason* that *Reason* should lead to this, but it really happens. It happened to me.

So, I have not by any means abandoned *reason*, but I have long since abandoned *Reason*.

Also, I'm going to confess that Leibniz's philosophical work does not make a whole lot of sense to me. So my adopting an *attitude* of "this is the best of all possible worlds" is in no way an endorsement of any belief in Leibniz's philosophical/theological system. And I certainly have also observed that there are people who do accept Leibniz's purported solution to the [problem of evil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil), who seem to use it as a way to turn a blind eye to the injustices that still occur in our world.

In short, I am taking an *attitude* that I find helps me function in a positive way in the world, without tying myself to a fully worked out philosophy about it.

## Related ideas

A related idea is [*amor fati*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amor_fati) ("love of fate"), popularized by Nietzsche but coming from [Stoicism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism).

Steve Pavlina wrote today about ["heaven"](http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2012/11/this-is-heaven/).

## Application

That I have adopted the *optimistic* attitude toward life, after having a mostly *pessimistic* one during most of my years, has practical applications. Being *grateful* every single day for every positive thing that happens enables me to more easily overcome the negative. My attitude is a choice I have made, and nurtured through various techniques, as mentioned [last Thanksgiving](/blog/2011/11/23/every-day-is-thanksgiving/).

Being optimistic does not mean ignoring the negative. It means maintaining the energy to do things, to set things right.

## Conclusion

I have embrace this world as *my* world. This is my choice, my attitude. May it be yours as well.
