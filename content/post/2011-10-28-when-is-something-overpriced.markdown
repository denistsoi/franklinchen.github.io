Very often I hear people complaining that "X is overpriced". I always listen carefully to try to figure out what they mean, because I've learned that the word "overpriced" can mean many things. I find that I learn a lot about people from how they use that word.

Here are 36 things people might mean when they say something is "overpriced".

## "Gas for my car is overpriced"

- The evil oil companies are colluding and price-fixing and don't deserve to keep all their huge profits.
- I am paying much more now for than I used to. Anything higher than I am used to is overpriced.
- Cheap driving is an American entitlement, and we need to do something in the Middle East.
- The un-American liberals won't let us drill, baby, drill!

## "College is overpriced"

- My parents had to work extra jobs to pay for my education.
- I didn't get the kind of job I thought I was guaranteed when taking out student loans.
- Those lazy liberal professors are getting paid way too much for doing nothing useful for society.
- I hate the whole stupid college sports system in America.
- The ease of getting federal student loans drives up college enrollment demand and therefore drives up college tuition as well.
- Those evil conservatives have turned education into a cold for-profit business enterprise.

## "Symphony tickets are overpriced"

- I don't like classical music and would rather be going to a musical.
- I'd rather just download music at home.
- The tickets are not overpriced, but the parking should be easy and free.
- People who go to the symphony are privileged and wealthy and think they are better than me.

## "Textbooks are overpriced"

- I could pay less for textbooks if the publishers didn't keep on churning out new editions every year and the professor made us get the new editions.
- The textbook industry is a parasite, and the authors are not getting their fair sure of the profits.
- Information should be free.
- I'd rather buy e-books for less than pay for dead tree books.

## "Macintosh computers are overpriced"

- I hate Steve Jobs.
- I hate those artsy liberals who love Macintosh computers.
- Computers manufactured from comparable materials should have similar costs.
- When I pay more, I should have more applications to choose from, not fewer.
- Apple takes away my freedom to tinker and charges me for taking away my freedom?

## "Fresh vegetables are overpriced"

- Why would I buy vegetables when I can buy a tasty Big Mac for less?
- All food should be cheap.
- I don't like to eat vegetables.
- The government artificially makes a lot of unhealthy, processed food cheaper than fresh vegetables because of lobbyists who get their subsidies to the industry.

## "Homes are overpriced"

- I can't buy the home that I deserve.
- I won't settle for a smaller home.
- I only want to live in a "good" neighborhood.
- Speculators and lax lending policies have created a housing bubble.
- End the Fed!

## "That big TV is overpriced"

- I'm jealous that you have a TV I can't buy.
- TV is stupid.
- If you just wait a while, you can pay less for the same TV in a couple of months.
- The price of the TV does not scale linearly with the size.
