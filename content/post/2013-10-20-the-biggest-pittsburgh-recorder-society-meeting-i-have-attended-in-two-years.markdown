At the second meeting of this season of the [Pittsburgh Recorder Society](http://www.facebook.com/PittsburghRecorderSociety), I was amazed by the huge turnout. There were **fourteen** of us, easily double the typical attendance in the past two seasons since [I first joined in 2011](/blog/2013/02/23/celebrating-two-years-of-playing-recorder/):

Fred was very excited by the attendance and told us he would like for us to perform as an entire group sometime.

As [promised after last month's meeting](/blog/2013/09/15/new-goals-for-a-new-season-of-the-pittsburgh-recorder-society/), I took the opportunity in this meeting to do some playing on my bass recorder. I also played tenor and soprano for some other pieces we worked on.

## Halloween-themed desserts

Since it is almost Halloween, Helen brought in some "scary" cupcakes that were, to me anyway, a sight to behold.

## Pittsburgh's rubber duck

People were talking about the planned departure later today of [our rubber duck](http://www.facebook.com/RubberDuckPittsburghPa).

In fact, in the duck's honor, I had brought my ukulele, and during the break I played [Rubber Duckie on my ukulele](/blog/2013/10/02/rubber-duckie-and-steel-city-ukuleles-rehearsal/) while singing along, and Anita joined in the singing too. I had worked pretty hard to be able to passably play this song before our duck left. I still need more work on the song.

## More recorders for me to play

I picked up two recorders from Helen that I had bid on at the last meeting, when a large collection of recorders was given to us to be auctioned off. More on this later!

## Conclusion

I had another great time at the Pittsburgh Recorder Society monthly meeting. Every month, our Sunday afternoon meeting is something I truly look forward to.
