I've been listening to JS Bach's Goldberg Variations for a quarter of a century now. I haven't actually said much about this piece on this blog, although I did mention attending a [concert featuring a string trio arrangement of it a year ago](/blog/2013/11/19/chamber-music-concert-at-cmu-featured-bachs-goldberg-variations-arranged-for-string-trio/).

I have a favorite recording, out of probably a dozen recordings I have heard since a college friend introduced me to the piece performed by Glenn Gould on piano . Several years ago I discovered my true favorite, upon encountering [Pierre Hantaï](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Hanta%C3%AF) on harpsichord in a CD recording.

## Why Hantaï stands out for me

Given that there are plenty of other performances that I consider worthy, why is Hantaï's by far my favorite?

- sustained intensity (many performances have me getting bored and sleepy)
- *rhythmic* drive is always there; the music never droops
- subtlety and shape to all phrasing and contrast
- no distractions of self-absorption (many performances have certain kinds of oddities that are magnified when spread out over an hour or more)
- nice harpsichord sound

Note: I once didn't like harpsichord, and always preferred a piano when possible, but now I actually prefer Bach's music on harpsichord, because of the nature of articulation and decay and how dissonances are more delicious on this instrument.

Here's a treat I just found by accident: a video of Hantaï performing the Goldberg Variations. Watch it if you care about the Goldberg Variations at all!

## Conclusion

**If you are already a fan of the Goldberg Variations, what is your favorite performance, and why? Also, does it matter to you whether piano or harpsichord is used?**
