I whipped up what I'll call my "end-of-summer vegetable medley" (since summer is basically over now), using ingredients we happened to have on hand, from [Kretschmann Farm](/blog/categories/kretschmann-farm/) as well as from Abby's parents.

## Recipe

### Equipment

- Large skillet (I happened to use a wok)

### Ingredients

- Oil for high heat (I used coconut oil)
- One green pepper
- One green zucchini
- One yellow zucchini
- One tomato
- Garlic, one large clove
- Seasoning mix (I used sea salt and [Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute](http://www.traderjoes.com/fearless-flyer/article.asp?article_id=539))
- Fresh cilantro
- Extra virgin olive oil

### Preparation

Green pepper: slice into strips.

Green zucchini: slice into thin coins.

Yellow zucchini: slice into thin coins.

Tomato: slice thinly.

Garlic: crush and mince a large clove (or more if you prefer).

Cilantro: chop up a bunch of fresh cilantro.

### Cooking

Once the ingredients are ready, the rest only takes a few minutes at high heat.

Heat the oil in the skillet to high heat. When the skillet is ready, put the green pepper and zucchinis into the skillet and toss/stir to coat with oil. Then add the seasoning mix and continue to toss/stir for a while.

When the vegetables look to be half done (to your liking; I prefer them to retain some bite rather than be soggy), add the tomato and garlic and continue to toss.

When everything is almost done, add the cilantro and toss/stir briefly, then turn off the heat.

Add extra virgin olive oil.

Enjoy!
