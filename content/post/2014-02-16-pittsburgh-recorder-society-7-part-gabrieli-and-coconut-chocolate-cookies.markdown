Because so many people are now regularly attending the Pittsburgh Recorder Society monthly meetings, we have enough critical mass to work on larger ensemble pieces. Fred pulled out a 7-part [Gabrieli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Gabrieli) piece for us from the 16th century. Fun! I look forward to continuing working on this in March.

We also continued work on other pieces we started earlier in the season. Fred's guidance is as inspiring as ever. I feel that every meeting of our group is a wonderful opportunity to grow as a musician.

After going home I found a trumpet ensemble performance of the Gabrieli online:

## Snacks

People brought in snacks to share, as usual, for break time.

Helen made super-tasty-looking "cookies" (I asked if they counted as cookies, and she said yes). Coconut plus coconut plus homemade equals *difficult to resist*!!

According to [my new rule](/blog/2014/01/16/a-system-for-quitting-eating-cookies/), here are the three cookies I ate.

{{< figure src="/images/recorder-2014-02-16/cookie3.jpg" title="My third cookie" >}}

I stopped at three, which was a good thing, because after I went home, I did feel a little bloated. I should really have eaten only two, I think. I did take one home for Abby to enjoy.
