There's less than one month less before the Pittsburgh Marathon, yet I have done no interval training for it until today. In ordinary circumstances, I would have been doing weekly interval training for some time now, but I had a late start with training in the winter, and so I simply have not felt ready for hard interval training until this week! Up till now, I have simply been scrambling to increase mileage and survive the long runs without injury and burnout, and this has been challenging enough: last week, I was fortunate to [bounce back from clear overtraining](/blog/2013/04/06/comeback-from-pittsburgh-marathon-overtraining/). But now I'm actually starting to feel strong, so it's time to sharpen up with interval training.

## Why interval training?

[Interval training](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_training) is well-known from research to be extremely beneficial for improving performance at distance running. It builds the body as well as the mind.

## My workout

A decade ago, I used to do interval training on the [CMU track of Gesling Stadium](http://athletics.cmu.edu/facilities/gesling), but I never really liked running around a synthetic track. There are other options, of course. I have good memories of running around the 1K dirt track (not the synthetic 400m track) at the [oval in Schenley Park](http://www.pittsburghparks.org/schenley-sports).

But nowadays, I find that the most convenient place for interval training is a trail loop near home in Frick Park that just happens to be very close to 800m in length. The drawback, of course, is that the length of this loop means I can only do intervals of multiples of 800m. Unfortunately, I prefer doing 1200m long intervals, while I find 1600m to be on the brutal side for an interval workout. But 800m will do for my first interval workout of the year!

I ended up doing 6x800. Oh, and it turned out to be a heat training workout too, because it suddenly got very warm, like summer already. I really hope that it cools down quickly and stays cool for the Pittsburgh Marathon! I don't want summer conditions to come until *after* the marathon.

After 15 minutes of easy running, I launched into the intervals.

Purely by subjective feel, I ended up running these intervals in an average of about 3:37 each, with 1:50 timed recovery:

- 3:38, 1:54
- 3:40, 1:51
- 3:37, 1:47
- 3:34, 1:50
- 3:35, 1:53
- 3:39

The numbers don't mean much to me right now, except as a checkpoint for the future. The workout was pretty tough. I felt semi-pukey and exhausted by the end!

## Footwear

I am now running only in Luna Sandals. I still have chafing issues, but we'll see if they clear up with time.

## What about high-intensity interval training?

[High-intensity interval training](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training) has become very popular in recent years, and for good reason. I was doing some on the treadmill in the winter in order to kickstart my running, but then put it aside when I left the treadmill.

I expect to start incorporating serious HIIT into my training to get even sharper.

## Conclusion

It's good to finally be back to interval training, after basically some years of not being serious and strong and disciplined enough to do it systematically.
