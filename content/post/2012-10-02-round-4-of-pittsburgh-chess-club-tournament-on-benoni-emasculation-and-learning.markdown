Tonight was the fifth (and penultimate) round of the current six-round Tuesday night tournament at the [Pittsburgh Chess Club](http://pittsburghcc.org/), the 14th Fred Sorensen Memorial. I last reported on the [third round](/blog/2012/09/19/round-3-of-pittsburgh-chess-club-tournament-another-approach-against-the-sicilian-squeezing-with-the-bind/), rather than the fourth round, because as I [mentioned in August upon signing up for the tournament](/blog/2012/08/29/returning-to-chess/), I took a bye for the fourth round because of a schedule conflict with a [Pittsburgh Java User Group](http://www.pghtech.org/networks/PittJug/events.aspx) meeting that I wanted to attend.

Thankfully, I came back for the fifth round finding that I was still tied for first, despite taking a half point bye in the fourth round, because nobody else had a perfect score after four rounds either.

The game tonight ended up one-sided; right after he resigned, he called it an "emasculation" (I won fairly quickly, in less than two hours). However:

- the unfolding of the game provides what I think is a nice illustration of how to win thematically against a Benoni opening structure
- my opponent and I had a good discussion, after the game, about learning and improvement

## The paradox of choice: how to play against the English Opening as Black?

I learned some days before tonight's game that my opponent and I were going to be paired. Based on my memory, and my database of games, I expected my opponent to play the [English Opening](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Opening). In our last game, in 2010, he had played the English. I planned to avoid the variation that I had played then, because of course he would be prepared for it.

### Reverse Sicilian?

I have a confession to make: in the past, I hated facing the English Opening as Black. It's the [paradox of choice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice:_Why_More_Is_Less): there are so many different ways to play against it. It is not a forcing, direct opening the way `1 e4` and `1 d4` are. In its purest form, in fact, it is a psychological trick, an attempt to play a [Sicilian Defense](/blog/categories/sicilian-defense/) in reverse, but with an extra move, if Black takes up the challenge of playing `1... e5`. That extra move makes a huge difference, both objectively and psychologically, in the kinds of positions and evaluations that can arise, as noted English Opening theoretician [John Watson](http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Chess-Openings-John-Watson/dp/1904600980) has brilliantly explained. Roughly, it's like playing the Sicilian Defense but getting an extra punch in before the fight starts.

In my 2010 game against my opponent, I in fact took up the challenge as Black and went into an aggressive reversed Sicilian variation, one tempo down: I played the Rubinstein Variation, which is exactly the [Mar칩czy Bind](/blog/2012/09/19/round-3-of-pittsburgh-chess-club-tournament-another-approach-against-the-sicilian-squeezing-with-the-bind/) in reverse. This is very risky, and although I won that game, I have also lost playing it. I do not play that kind of reversed Sicilian any more.

### Alternatives

There are many, many alternatives to playing for a reverse Sicilian as Black. Tonight I chose to aim to fight for the `d5` square, to play to occupy the center and Queen side.

## Overview of my game

### The opening

As expected, my opponent played `1 c4`, the English Opening. After some more moves, it turned out that my opponent allowed me to play a reversed [Benoni](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoni_Defense).

Again, there are dangers in playing reversed openings, in which Black takes the aggressive role White ordinarily takes but with a tempo down, but in this case, because of a positional subtlety, I was allowed to play a good version of the reversed Benoni as Black:

The problem for White is that he used his extra moves to play `b3` and `Bb2`, but now the Bishop is blocked up and is misplaced. This is an example of what proponents of the Black pieces such as John Watson and [Andr치s Adorj치n](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A1s_Adorj%C3%A1n) have observed about the subtleties of having extra moves: sometimes they are committal and do not help the side which has them!

#### Concepts of the Benoni

For those who are not very familiar with the Benoni as a chess opening, here is an overview of the goals of the two sides, which I'll call the *attacker* and the *counter-attacker* (in the regular Benoni, these are White and Black, respectively, and in the reversed Benoni, these are Black and White, respectively).

Note that I don't mention a role *defender* here, because this opening is so sharp and aggressive for both sides that really, both sides are simultaneously attacking and defending for their lives. This opening is not for the faint-hearted for either side! It is a "kill or be killed" type of opening. I have played the Benoni on both sides, and both killed and been killed. (Most recently, I [played the counter-attacking role against a boy in a casual game](/blog/2012/05/31/some-pretty-attacking-chess-at-a-party-last-weekend/) and broke through quickly.)

The *attacker* has more space, has a center pawn wedge thrust into the innards of the counter-attacker's position, and aims to squeeze the counter-attacker to death, preventing Queen side counterplay, while preparing to blast through at the tip of the pawn wedge.

The *counter-attacker* has less space, and hopes to launch a flank attack on the back end of the attacker's pawn wedge and destroy the attacker's center, coming around the attacker's weakened Queen side to swarm in that way.

### The middle

The game tonight had the counter-attacker never getting Queen side counterplay off the ground, while the attacker (Black) broke through without resistance in the center: note that Black has played `e4` successfully and White's thematic `b4` is nowhere near possible.

### The end

There was no real end game to speak of, since by the time Queens came off the board, the game was lost for White.

## Discussion with my opponent

After the game, my opponent and I discussed the errors that he made during the game: I considered that allowing the reverse Benoni after `b3` and `Bb2` was an error, and then after that, failing to prevent e4 with Nd2 was an error. 
### Study

He noted that he had prepared for our game by studying our game in 2010 and had improved his understanding of the opening variation we had played then, but I told him that I, too, had looked at the game, and never planned to walk into his preparation. He said that he had every confidence that if I had played the same opening variation, I would have done my homework also, to improve what I did last time. He said he respected that even against a weaker player such as himself, he trusted that I would not play an opening I considered inferior or unsound *just because I could get away it*. I really appreciated this comment and statement of trust, because in fact this is my current serious attitude. In a blitz game, I might play around, but in a serious tournament game, I will no longer play "junk". *This was not always the case*. In fact, in one of our earliest games, years ago, I had played junk against him and won, but not felt happy about doing that.

### Learning

I congratulated him for doing his homework, and having improved so much in the past couple of years, and he said he learns from his mistakes. Bravo! I have no doubt that he will study the opening we played today and be ready in the future not just for me, but anyone who plays how I did today. Some people make the mistake, during these Tuesday night tournaments in which we face the same people repeatedly, of preparing one-shot ideas against specific opponents, but what we really want to do (and what he does and what I do) is use these rematches as excuses to improve our *general* knowledge and skill.

My opponent said, before we parted tonight, "I don't learn from my wins. I learn from my losses." 

I would amend that remark, however. I try to learn from my wins as well. Just because I won this game doesn't mean I haven't gone and analyzed *where I could have won even faster* or *possible good moves he could have made that I overlooked*. Every game that I play, whether I win or lose, I want to learn something from. I have won games in which I played horribly and didn't see anything and only won because my opponent saw less. I'm not satisfied with just *seeing more than someone else*; I actually want *to see the naked truth*.

## What next?

Next Tuesday is the last round of the six-round tournament. I am now the undisputed leader for first, meaning that if I draw next week, I am guaranteed at least a tie for first prize; if I win, I get clear first prize.

*None of that really matters to me*. I'm in this to play as well as I can, enjoy the art, enjoy the sport, and to write up everything I learn along the way, whether I win, draw, or lose. I am, of course, grateful that I have been winning.

### (Update of 2012-10-07)

Oops, it turns out that I was wrong in figuring that I was the undisputed leader for first going into the final round: in fact, someone took a bye in the fifth round after a perfect score in the first four rounds, so he and I are tied for first going into the final round, and in fact, we are playing each other on Tuesday. So if I draw, that only guarantees that we split first prize. I need to win in order to get clear first prize.

I am, of course, playing for a win. For better or for worse, **I have never played for a draw in my life, against anyone, even a Grandmaster.**

## Conclusion

Tonight I got a chance to play an opening, reverse Benoni, that I haven't played for some time in a tournament, and I won the game through clear, thematic moves. In addition, we had a pleasant discussion after the game, and I look forward to seeing him play better in this opening in the future, and I too will refine my play in it.
