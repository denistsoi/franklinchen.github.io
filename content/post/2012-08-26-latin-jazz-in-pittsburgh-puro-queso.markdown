One great thing about Pittsburgh is the free cultural programs at the Carnegie Library. Abby and I checked out a local Latin jazz quartet, [Puro Queso](http://puroquesojazz.com/), performing at the main branch of the library in Oakland, as part of their regular [Sunday afternoon World Kaleidoscope series](http://www.carnegielibrary.org/events/details.cfm?event_id=69113). This event was also posted on the ["Free and Almost Free in Pittsburgh" meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/pittsburgh-free/events/77709582/).

I was amused to notice that when we arrived, I recognized the saxophonist! It was someone I had seen around a lot on campus at work at CMU. I figured he must be staff or faculty. (I looked him up and sure enough, he is [Paul Eiss, professor in the history department](http://www.history.cmu.edu/faculty/eiss.html).)

As usual at these library events, where time is limited and the purpose is to spark interest not only in the music but also to encourage concert attendance and CD purchases, the mustical selections tended toward well-known classic crowd pleasers, rather than more adventurous material or wilder improvisation. In any case, it was fun, and Abby and I danced a little too. Some of the selections I recognized:

- bossa nova: Song of the Jet ([Samba do Avi√£o](http://letras.mus.br/tom-jobim/49065/))
- bossa nova: [Mas Que Nada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mas_que_Nada)
- bolero: [Besame mucho](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9same_Mucho), featuring a female vocalist
- a Cuban [son](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_%28music%29) whose name I have forgotten
