title: "What happens when you donate your used clothing?"
---
I hate throwing stuff away, and that includes clothing I have that I
no longer wear. Abby participates in clothing exchanges with *local*
women in order to avoid wastage, and she takes my clothing also, to
give away somewhere when possible.

I was interested to read an
[economics blog post](http://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2015/05/quandaries-of-global-trade-in.html)
about possible unintended consequences, however, of clothing donations
that go to low-income countries.

Apparently, what happens is that this flow of used clothing thanks to
*globalization* competes with *local* textile and clothing
industries. The used clothing ends up being resold rather than
donated. Interesting, huh?
