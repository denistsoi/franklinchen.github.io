Today, many of us geeks celebrate [Pi Day](http://piday.org/), because *π = 3.1415926535897932384626433...* is such an important number in math and science. I have to confess that I have never celebrated Pi Day, but it was just last year that I found out there was a movement *against* celebrating Pi Day, and advocating the celebration of [Tau Day](http://tauday.com/) instead, where the special constant (which a community has chosen to be denoted by the Greek letter "tau", *τ*) is *2π*, which is *6.283...*. Upon examining the evidence briefly, I had immediately agreed that indeed, we should not be celebrating Pi Day, and that therefore, today is simply [Half-Tau Day](http://halftauday.com/).

If this is getting **much** too geeky for you, feel free to ignore the rest of this blog post. Otherwise, bear with me!

## My dark days with *π*

I suffered through the use of *π* throughout high school, when we learned trigonometry and all the cosines and sines involved radians from 0 to *2π*. Why is a complete revolution around the circle 2 times a constant, rather than being its own constant? And then there was calculus, same story.

I even got sucked into true geekery, memorizing nearly 50 digits of *π* in the summer after I graduated from high school. I still remember what happened: I was in a van traveling from Frankfurt to Jena, East Germany (this was 1987 before the fall of the Berlin Wall) as a member of the US team for the [International Physics Olympiad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Physics_Olympiad) when I got really bored, and fellow teammate [Bryan Beatty](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/bryan-beatty/13/497/581) wrote out in pencil by memory the first 50 digits of *π* into the front cover of a book I had on me, and I proceeded to memorize those digits (no, I did not remember them forever).

Doing math and physics homework in college, I got burned repeatedly by the extra work of carrying around factors of 2 and canceling them out when doing arithmetic, because of the incorrect definition of the "circle constant" as *π*.

### (Update of 2013-08-06)

While doing some cleaning, I happened to find in my office the very book that I had on me during the trip and that Bryan wrote into (not the inside front cover, but the inside back cover)!

### (Update of 2013-08-22)

I found out that the physicist Hugh Young, the author of the book I have that Bryan wrote *π* into, [just died](http://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2013/august/aug22_hughyoungobit.html). RIP.

## The mystery of *2π*

*2π* keeps on popping up in places other than in high school trigonometry and calculus. As Michael Hartl points out in his excellent [Tau Manifesto](http://tauday.com/tau-manifesto), anyone who has used the Gaussian ("bell curve") distribution, through work in probability, statistics, machine learning, etc., sees the square root of *2π* all the time, and engineers and physicists see *2π* all the time when doing the Fourier transform. Eventually we just learn to immediately think that *π* is just half of something. For example, if you're doing an integral only on half the *x*-axis, you remember to use *π*. This is stupid, carrying around that extra 2 everywhere.

**Conceptually**, the fundamental constant is clearly *2π*, not *π*. That is the argument we **τ**-believers accept: our concepts should be mapped to our notation. I strongly recommend that disbelievers watch Hartl's hilarious talk on *τ*:

## The importance of good notation for concepts, and some more examples

[Good notation](http://terrytao.wordpress.com/advice-on-writing-papers/use-good-notation/) is actually important in communicating ideas, expressing them, thinking them. Good notation reduces mental clutter and pointless work.

In physics, there is the concept of frequency. It turns out [angular frequency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_frequency) is more convenient to use, hence instead of writing the frequency *f*, we prefer to work with "omega", which is *ω = 2πf*.

As a related example of the usefulness of choosing a proper numerical constant, consider the original [Planck's constant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant) *h*. Physicists quickly realized that it was much more convenient to use the reduced constant *ħ*, which is just *h* divided by *2π*. When writing equations in quantum mechanics, nobody uses *h*. We use *ħ* (pronounced "h bar"). The annoying factor of *2π* is removed from the picture. In fact, in my former life as a physics student, most of the work we did involved using [natural units](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_units), in which equations and calculations are simplified by simply setting *c* and *ħ* to 1.

## Conclusion

OK, we all know that it is completely hopeless to convert the world to using τ instead of π. Just as it is "completely hopeless" for the United States to become a multi-party political system or abolish the Electoral College.

**Nevertheless, [π is wrong!](http://www.math.utah.edu/~palais/pi.html)**

Oh, and on June 28 this year, you bet I'll be celebrating Tau Day.

P.S. Please don't take any of this too seriously: I don't!
