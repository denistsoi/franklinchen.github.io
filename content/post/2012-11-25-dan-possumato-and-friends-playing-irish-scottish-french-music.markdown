Abby and I checked out a musical performance at the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, main branch. They have a regular Sunday afternoon "World Kaleidoscope" series featuring world sounds from local musicians: two months ago I reported on some delightful [local Appalachian music](/blog/2012/09/23/living-appalachian-music-of-southwestern-pennsylvania/).

[Today's performance](http://www.carnegielibrary.org/events/details.cfm?event_id=69116) was by [Dan Possumato](http://www.danpossumato.com) and friends, featuring mostly Irish music, with Dan on button accordion.

We had a good time. Among the selections:

- Scottish music
- Irish jigs and reels
- Irish waltz "Planxty Irwin" that Abby and I danced to
- a French [hanter dro](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanter-dro)
