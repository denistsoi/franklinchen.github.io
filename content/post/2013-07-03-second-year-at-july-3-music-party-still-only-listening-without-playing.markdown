[Last year Abby and I went](/blog/2012/07/03/petrified-at-a-music-jam-session-so-i-didnt-play-but-watched-and-listened/) to a July 3 music potluck/party at Susan's for the first time. We attended again. I brought my flute.

Again I enjoyed hearing two groups of people playing music. I am not so much into the "old time" music, however, which the group outside in the backyard was playing, so I hung out inside instead, where I liked much better the blues guitar and ukulele and singing and piano. *I would like to join in one day* myself, but today did not feel up to it. I never took out my flute; it didn't seem appropriate for any of the music anyway.

At [my third year](/blog/2014/07/03/third-year-at-july-3-music-party-and-finally-participated-in-jamming/) of this annual party, I actually played both piano and ukulele!
