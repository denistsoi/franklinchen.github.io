It has not yet been *three months* since I [started this blog](/blog/2011/09/22/starting-a-new-web-site/). I have managed to post something every single day since I started, apart from my decision over a month ago to [take Saturday off](/blog/2011/11/12/starting-a-mini-digital-sabbath/). Now that I've proved to myself that I can maintain the [habit](/blog/2011/09/26/i-dont-feel-like-practicing-but-im-gonna-do-it-anyway/), I'm going to take a break (coinciding with the winter holidays), reflect more deeply on where my blog has explored, and plan out and implement some **major changes and improvements**.

I strongly believe that **[content is king](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_content#Content_is_king)**. This is why I have deliberately focused entirely on content in the past three months, rather than on format, tone, and style, even when I became increasingly aware of areas of improvement outside the area of content. I will work on those other areas for 2012.

Meanwhile, I would like to improve the content as well, by making it more useful to you. I am listing here just a few of the broad topic ideas I expect to address in future posts (many of the topic areas have already appeared in the past three months, while others have not).

**What do you want to read here?**

If there are topics on this list (or *not* on this list) you are particularly interested in reading about here, let me know; I will take all requests seriously!

The list, roughly organized by topic but not in any particular order (and by no means exhaustive):
