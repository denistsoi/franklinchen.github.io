I'm excited that I finally got my Casey Burns Small-Handed Folk Flute, a fine keyless Irish flute, that [I ordered almost two months ago](/blog/2012/06/12/ordered-the-casey-burns-small-handed-irish-flute/)!

Here are photos of my flute, assembled and disassembled:

Now I have to start breaking it in, gradually, over the next month, according to the instructions.
