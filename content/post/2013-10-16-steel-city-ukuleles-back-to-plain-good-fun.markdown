It's been over a week since I [performed as part of the Steel City Ukuleles in the Wilkins School Community Center Ecofest](/blog/2013/10/05/performing-with-the-steel-city-ukuleles-at-the-wilkins-school-community-center-ecofest-2013-with-videos/). I was very relieved to have no more self-imposed performance obligations for a while, feeling burned out for a while, to tell the truth. But I was ready to get back into playing just for fun.

## Members' choice!

We had a fun [session this week](http://www.meetup.com/Steel-City-Ukuleles/events/140097142/) in which all of us had earlier been invited to submit music we personally wanted to play. I had submitted ["Mister Sandman"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Sandman), a song I've loved since (amusingly) first hearing it when watching "Back to the Future" way back. I was really excited to finally be singing it and playing it with others.

We did various other member-contributed selections also, including a ["Cups" song](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cups_%28song%29) that apparently has become all the craze because of moving cups around as part of percussion! Three of us had practiced ahead of time to play the cups. I have to say I was impressed:

## Rubber Duckie

We went over "Rubber Duckie" again. I love this song. I'm getting better at singing and strumming it simultaneously.

## Kazoo

I finally bought a cheap kazoo for use in the future (several of us used kazoos in the Ecofest performance, but I did not have a kazoo at the time), as Jack got a whole bunch to sell to us:

## Conclusion

I enjoyed getting back to just plain fun with singing and playing ukulele, with no more performances in the near future that I've volunteered to be a part of.
