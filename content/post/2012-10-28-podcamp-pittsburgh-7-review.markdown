This year, I attended the two-day [PodCamp Pittsburgh](http://www.podcamppittsburgh.com/) yet again, for my third year in a row (and this is the seventh year of its existence). (I wrote a little bit about last year's PodCamp Pittsburgh (6) [here](/blog/2011/10/21/one-month-anniversary-of-my-blog/).)

This year's theme was "Build your digital toolbox".

This year, I got Abby to come with me to part of it to see what it was about, since I had raved about 5 and 6.

The emphasis of PodCamp Pittsburgh has been changing with time. I noticed that in the session descriptions. The previous two years had more of a personal focus while now, there is a lot of business interest. Still, I found useful advice while attending this year.

Videos from PodCamp Pittsburgh 7 are available [here](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS4FjD4nMvYNjjHGK1j2lFs3DUnfEurtR).

## (Update of 2014-01-16)

This is an unfinished post that is one of many in the past two years that lay unfinished because I had originally planned to write a very detailed report but never got around to it. I decided that I might as well release all these unfinished posts rather than leave them completely out of the record.
