Today was the eight [Pittsburgh Geek Out Day](http://www.pghgeekoutday.com/). I hadn't been one in a whole year, because of big changes in my life that have affected my use of time and energy.

A topic I proposed that we discussed was "test-driven learning".

A session summary is [here](http://www.pghgeekoutday.com/sessions/2013).

## (Update of 2014-01-16)

This is an unfinished post that is one of many in the past two years that lay unfinished because I had originally planned to write a very detailed report but never got around to it. I decided that I might as well release all these unfinished posts rather than leave them completely out of the record.
