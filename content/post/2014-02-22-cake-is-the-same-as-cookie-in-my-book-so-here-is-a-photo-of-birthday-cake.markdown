Since I consider cake to be in the same category as cookies for [my rule](/blog/2014/01/16/a-system-for-quitting-eating-cookies/), I had to take a photo of this slice of birthday cake.

It was difficult for me to say no to a bit of cake mainly because Abby's parents had us over for dinner and this cake was for a delayed joint celebration of Abby's birthday and her father's birthday.

Based on how I felt when we got home, I still think that it's best for me to avoid cake in general.
