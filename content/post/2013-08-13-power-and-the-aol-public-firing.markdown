By sheer coincidence, two articles came to my attention within a short period of time that seemed to go well together well.

The first: ["Power robs the brain of empathy"](http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/356229).

The second: ["Listen To AOL CEO Tim Armstrong Fire A Patch Employee In Front Of 1,000 Coworkers"](http://www.sfgate.com/technology/businessinsider/article/LEAKED-AUDIO-Listen-To-AOL-CEO-Tim-Armstrong-4723680.php).

I'm not making a judgment on whether the guy deserved to be fired or whatever, just intrigued by the way he was fired.
