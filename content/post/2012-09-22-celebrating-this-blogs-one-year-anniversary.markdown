One year ago, I started this blog, inspired by my attending [PodCamp Pittsburgh](http://podcamppittsburgh.com/).

I'm not going to write up a lengthy retrospective today, because I have to go soon to a concert Abby will be in tonight, as part of the [Pittsburgh Mandolin Society orchestra](http://www.pittsburghmandolinsociety.org/) in Synod Hall. It was interesting rereading my own [one-month retrospective from last year](/blog/2011/10/21/one-month-anniversary-of-my-blog/): I've learned so much about myself, and other people, and changed so much, during the past year of writing here.

All I will say for now is: *I will continue to write for an online audience, and I expect to do this for the rest of my life*.

## PodCamp Pittsburgh reminder!

PodCamp Pittsburgh 7 is happening later this year than it did last year; it is coming October 27-28. There is still a [call for speakers](http://podcamppittsburgh.com/pcpgh7-speaker-submission/). I remember last year some of the guys who inspired me had joked that I should start a blog and then come back the following year to talk about it. I don't know if I'm ready to do that yet, but at least it no longer sounds at all like a crazy idea!

## Think about it

If you haven't attended PodCamp Pittsburgh before, check it out! Registration is open, and the whole weekend is *free*! Unbelievable value for something that *changed my life forever*.
