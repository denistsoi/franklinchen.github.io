A year ago I dashed off an [emotional blog post upon learning of the death of Steve Jobs](/blog/2011/10/05/i-cannot-imagine-my-life-without-the-influence-of-steve-jobs/).

Three weeks later, I wrote [my last note on Steve Jobs](/blog/2011/10/27/why-i-am-not-reading-the-biography-of-steve-jobs/).

Today, having ignored basically all media coverage of Steve Jobs since last October, and still ignoring the biography, all I have to say is:

<blockquote>
Let the dead bury the dead.
</blockquote>
