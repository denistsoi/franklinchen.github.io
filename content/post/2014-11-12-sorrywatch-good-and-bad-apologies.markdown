I try to avoid reading news, but now and then I see an article about someone or other "apologizing" for something, and most of the time, the apology is pretty bad. Personally, I admire more someone who defiantly refuses to apologize. The stupidest, most transparent copout, of course, is "I apologize *if* (something bad resulted from what I said or did)", rather than the real apology "I apologize *that* ..."

My own preferences when it comes to apologies:

- *Always* apologize for something if you *do* believe you did wrong.
- *Never* "apologize" for something if you *don't* believe you did wrong.

I don't need to feel comforted and coddled by **bullshit** fake apologies: but I do want to know the truth of where you stand and I'll respect that even if where you stand might be something like "Yeah, I'm a racist and proud of it!" I want you to look me in the eye and spit at me and say that, and I will at least respect you for being *honest*.

By coincidence, I recently found a Web site devoted to analyzing different kinds of apologies, good or bad or bizarre. Have fun: [SorryWatch](http://www.sorrywatch.com/).
