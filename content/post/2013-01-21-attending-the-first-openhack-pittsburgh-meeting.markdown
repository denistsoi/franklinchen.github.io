I was excited to attend the [very first meeting](http://www.meetup.com/pittsburgh-ruby/events/96033112/) of [OpenHack Pittsburgh](http://openhack.github.com/pittsburgh/), out of curiosity and as a way to force myself to make progress on a personal programming project of mine using Scala (ironically, after spending the day at work on Scala; apparently I couldn't get enough of it).

The point of [OpenHack](http://openhack.github.com/) is to provide a space for programmers to meet up and work on something. It could be a shared project, it could be a personal project.

Some people come with something to work on, others come to meet other programmers and pitch in on a project, others come to learn something. It was cool that some people left the first meeting finally getting set up on Ruby or Python or Clojure, and working on a project, with help from other people.

And yes, in the two hours I was there, I did make good progress on my project. It's not finished yet though.
